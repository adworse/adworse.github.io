          My name is Stan Ahrens.  I signed up with Dandrew 8 days ago. I was led to believe that I can become a  intermediary and bring REO Bulk portfolios to Dandtrew and receive a finders fee.  I do not see info pertaining to this in the download material. I am already a intermediary and work closely with a investment company that invests in NPL portfolios. Since I am in contact with a lot of banks I see a lot of REO portfolios But I do not have a REO buyer.<br> <br>That is my question: Can I bring REO Bulk deals to Dandrew??? <br><br>P.S.  Why did it take 8 days to get a response from the Dandrew Media in LV that I should contact Ask Dandrew??<br>Regards,<br>Stan Ahrens.<br>Nuport National, LLC<br>760-405-5500<br>nuport@usa.com        </p>

          Stan,<br><br>No. You are completely wrong in many, many ways.  Let me explain:<br><br>1.  You submitted this request asking for deal-related advice to DandrewHelpDesk.com. <br>In the AskDandrew Owner’s Manual that you received when you signed up for you $1 Banker program, we told you NEVER to send deal-related questions to the DandrewHelpDesk.com<br><br>They are not equipped to handle these questions. So you didn’t listen to us. *They are told to ignore deal related questions* and to refer you to AskDandrew. Which you figured out after 8 days. <br><br>See the AskDandrew Owners Manual.pdf and How To Submit Questions To AskDandrew.pdf,<br><br>2.  You’re $1 Banker program is you signed up for allows you to only submit for commercial deals only that need financing. <br>The Arbitrager is the only program that allows you to do Bulk REO trades with us. At no time was this ever expressed or implied that you could submit bulk REO/NPL deals to us. This is a different business and if you had these valuable contacts, you should have registered for this program. <br><br>To refresh your memory as to what each program contains, I invite you to watch the entire 2 hour webinar we did with Jason again here: <br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hI8tsB5DeQ&amp;feature=youtu.be<br><br>To those who have been with us for years, it sounds like you are trying to get something for nothing here. But I’ll let the community answer for themselves. <br><br>3.  You’ve only logged into AskDandrew *once (1) to watch 1 video* and don’t know what you should be doing. <br><br>It doesn’t sound like you like to follow directions. I’ll extend to you the Olive Branch one more time to you to get the Arbitager program by going to www.JasonsATeam.com to show the community and yourself you can play along with the rest. Its why our students are so filthy successful. <br><br>Either way, I don’t care. Because I don’t have the time or patience to deal with folks who can’t follow simple instructions. <br><br>*The dollar trial period goes both ways. As much as you are trying us out, we’re weeding out the Time Vampires. It’s simply not worth it to us.*<br><br>I’m sorry if this sounds harsh, but we have a great program here and I have to protect my members.  If you read the Dandrew Partners’ Shareholder Minutes that was emailed to you but you didn’t open, you would know what I mean by that. <br><br>Now Stan, I’m sure there are many other “gurus” who will gladly take your hard earned money in exchange for wonderful promises of grandeur and blow smoke where the sun doesn’t shine. But you and I both know how that will probably end up. <br><br>*And in the end, when you try to sell them your bulk REO portfolios, and they don’t close, remember it’s your reputation on the line and not theirs when your valuable banking contacts will stop working with you*. <br><br>Are you going to roll up your sleeves and work with us or are you going to quit? That is what we&#39;re all waiting to hear. <br><br>Sal <br>        </p>
