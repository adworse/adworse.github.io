          AJ,  I was on the FDIC.gov website last night getting myself reacquainted with it and came across a small community bank nearby me and was wondering if this might be something that we are interested in? Here&#39;s what I have from their Sept. 30, 2015 Assets and Liabilities report (it&#39;s their most recent, not sure why their Dec. 30, 2015 report is not showing?): Total assets $311.676mm (9/30/15) $279.642mm (9/30/14), Net loans and leases $129.686mm (9/30/15) and $127.413mm (9/30/14), Clicked on Net loans and leases: row 6 All real estate loans for 9/30/15 is $103mm and $97.632mm for 9/30/14. Row 15 1-4 Family Residential $25.363mm for 9/30/15. <br><br>In their past due and non accrual assets they have 68 loans secured by junior liens 1-4 family residential properties that are 30-89 days past due. Now, when I scroll down on the past due and non accrual asset page, and if I&#39;m looking at this right, line 63 assets in non accrual status is $5.943mm and line 64 loans secured by real estate, total is $5.472mm. Of the $5.472mm, $3.616mm comes from construction and land development and $1,413mm comes from secured by 1-4 family residential properties, the remaining amount comes from owner occupied and individual loans. <br><br>Is this something that we are interested in?          </p>

          Well, AJ, I took a quick look at your numbers, and it looks like a good candidate for you to call the VP or asset manager, and use our scripts.<br><br>You know, the ones that offers your assistance with their balance sheet needs, and making sure that they are receiving coverage from your firm.<br><br>Use the script when you call, and you will be taken seriously.  See where it goes.  Read them their own numbers from the FDIC, that you quoted me, and tell them that &quot;it looks like you are having an increase in _____&quot;.  <br><br>Then shut up.  They will tell you if they need to move balance sheet or not, in their own way.<br><br>Nice work so far, keep this up!<br>-AJ        </p>

          Ok, so let&#39;s say that this bank is wanting to move their balance sheet and is ready to send their asset tape over along with with pricing expectations. I don&#39;t have a &quot;work&quot; email address and website (credibility kit) yet, and Sal is always saying that we need to be credible in this business. So with that said, should I tell this bank to email me this info at my personal address, and maybe make something up along the lines of my website and email are currently down due to technical issues??         </p>

          Hello Sal, and mini Sals,<br><br>I was just watching a Bulk REO DVD where Sal was talking to the audience about mortgages, or deed of trust, interest rates where Sal&#39;s interest is higher than his neighbor&#39;s interest on his house. Instead of doing a loan modification with the bank, Sal mentioned his tip of doing a &quot;slow pay&quot;; where the mortgage payment is due in the beginning of the month, but you make your mortgage payment near the end of the month. And, you do this for a few months in which case after those few months of slow paying your mortgage you call and notify your bank that you&#39;re having difficulties making these payments. Another point from Sal in talking with your bank at this point, is to ask them if they have copies of the original documents because you may have to file bankruptcy with your attorney. <br><br>My question is, is if your bank does not have copies of the original documents, what happens to your loan with the bank as they are not legally documented to collect mortgage payments from you and foreclose on you?         </p>

          There is a *Lost Note Affidavit* that the seller can file. Also, these notes can be purchased at deep discounts because the *Transfer and Assignment* documents (which you were referring to) is missing, so another affidavit needs to be signed, notarized and recorded. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          AJ! How&#39;s it goin? I have a couple of questions about the credibility kit that I believe is suppose to come with the program that I just recently purchased. 1) When will I be able to get access to the credibility kit so I can start tinkering around with it and get my website setup? 2) Is there a monthly fee that comes with this credibility kit?         </p>

          Hey Sal, I came across a gentleman who has a client that is converting two side-by-side buildings into an apartment complex in Manhattan. This conversion project is going to cost the borrower $40M total. Supposedly the borrower has secured $25M in bank financing already. The borrower needs an additional $15M either in the form of equity or debt financing. I don&#39;t have all the necessary info to submit as I am not completely certain we would be interested in this and do not want to waste anyones time.  So my question is, is this apartment conversion project something we would have an interest in?        </p>

          Hey Sal, I finally got a hold of this gentleman to talk with him about his clients apartment conversion project. Originally he had told me that his client was looking for debt or equity financing. Now, he is saying that his client is looking for a equity partnership. If I remember correctly, Dandrew does not do equity or JV parternships with people whom Dandrew has not done business with in the past, right?         </p>

          Ok... just an FYI though, the gentleman I spoke with is an attorney and financial advisor. When I spoke with him, he said that his client is willing to pay higher rates than a conventional insitution; however, not exactly hard money rates. He did not like our 3-6 points either. I will see what I can do... try to twist his arm with the availability of our capital on-hand and that he did not send me the executive summary like he said he was going to about a week and a half ago... wish me luck!         </p>

          AJ: tell him to send you over the deal so you can give him more precise terms. If he doesnt perform, then he&#39;s not worth your time. And for all intents and purposes, I can say I&#39;m an attorney or a financial advisor or whatever I want to over the phone. Dont believe everything you hear... Trust, but verify.<br>        </p>

          Ok thanks... He is an attorney, I already checked him out.<br><br>On a side note, I just got this email from a person that filled out my contact page. I don&#39;t understand some parts of it. Here is what he wrote:<br><br>&quot;We need a source for 120 day $2M bridge loans that will be fully secured by a cash backed, irrevocable, unconditional, SBLC issued directly to the bridge lender as beneficiary and delivered through bank to bank protocol directly to the bridge lender’s bank for authentication.

          Hey Sal,<br><br>I have been talking with another gentleman, Scott, who has a client that is looking for either debt/equity financing or an Equity Partnership. His client has secured $3.2mm from another equity partner already. His client is wanting to raise another $800,000 to make the total $4mm to, I believe, use as a down payment to acquire this 600 unit MF property in Dallas, TX. His clients negotiated the original purchase price of $17M down to $12,240,000. I told Scott that our minimum for lending on MF is $1mm. He said his client is pretty flexible and would be open to us lending $1mm in debt/equity, Equity Partnership, or talk about other equity structures. However, when I explained our lending terms of 11%-16% and 3-6 points he didn&#39;t like it; he actually thought our terms were ridiculous and said our terms would not work for them. So even though Scott does not like our debt/equity financing terms, I was wondering if Dandrew would still have an interest in offering an Equity Partnership to Scott&#39;s client?<br><br>Here are the details:<br><br>Asset type: MF; 600 units; 2 properties<br>Location: Dallas, TX<br>Requested loan amount: original $800,000, however, they are flexible and open to $1mm or however much equity we would like to bring in.<br>Current NOI: $841,815.37<br>Proforma NOI: Year 1 $1,029,193<br>Debt Stack: they&#39;re borrowing $3.2mm from another investor. Looking at the contract I am not sure if they have secured the remaining $9,792,000 from either a bank or another equity lender.<br>Sources and uses: $1M for capital improvements for both exterior and apartment renovations, not sure of cost of repair per door.  $12,240,000 to purchase property. Total amount of funds borrowered from lenders and investors, $13,240,000.<br>Exit Strategy: 3-5 year period to establish, build and grow equity, net operating income and overall value of each property. Once goals are achieved, will conduct meetings with equity partners, at year 3 and 5 or inbetween, to either sell the two properties as a portfolio or individually, or sell one property and hang onto the other property. <br><br>I have all the documentation to help make an informed decision, if you would like to see. Scott did sign our NDA form provided at your link. I have signed it as well for his records and I know that this document was recorded and timestamped by Dandrew as well.<br><br>This property is under K. I do not know the exact the date, however, I do know it needs to close by the beginning of September. His clients have $120,000 in escrow plus another $50,000 because they had to extend for another 30 days. The contract was orginally suppose to close August 5, 2011, but as I mentioned it has been extended another 30 days because Scott&#39;s client have not obtained all the funding they need to purchase. <br><br>Scott&#39;s client are wanting to develop a relationship with a lender or lenders to do more business over the next 24 months. His clients are wanting to do $150mm in business over these next 24 months doing similar deals to this one. <br><br> Thank you. Please let me know your thoughts.        </p>

          Deal Sal, <br><br>I spoke with Scott today. He is excited that you are interested in this deal. In speaking with him I found out the new closing date, September 6, 2011.

          Hi Sal, I submitted this to DandrewDeals.com on Sunday, 2 days ago. If you cannot find my submission, please let me know I will submit again. Scott is eager to get a meeting scheduled with you, including his clients, to go over the proforma excel spreadsheet. Would you be able to schedule a meeting with Scott and his clients this week?         </p>

          Dear Sal, I noticed on Dandrew&#39;s Lending Parameters the lending terms are 11% - 13% and 2-3 points. I have mine at 11% - 16% and 3-6 points. Should I change my terms to reflect Dandrew&#39;s terms, or at least lower my terms a little bit?         </p>

          Hey Sal, I was wondering if you might know of someone who would be interested in financing this scenario. Borrower is requesting a loan, either debt or equity; open-minded to an equity partnership as well, of $600,000 - $700,000 for 5 years to purchase 48 REO units in Kansas City, KS, from a bank. (If he is provided debt financing, he cannot pay more than 15% interest as that would not work for him in this scenario.)  Borrower is direct with the bank and is currently negotiating a lower purchase price of $600,000 to $700,000. **He is looking to close this deal in 3 weeks. Borrower will be bringing in some of his own funds; between $25,000 - $30,000. His target NOI for year 1 is between $160,000 - $180,000; year 2 is $230,000. This 48 unit REO package is at a 39 cap rate and mostly consists of SFR, 1 4-plex, and 1 duplex. Some of these SFR units need minor rehab; one unit is inhabitable because of fire damage. Rehab costs are around $30,000. These units are currently 37% occupied. Borrower has his own rehab crew and management crew in place to handle these units accordingly. Borrower has also been investing in this area for the past 11 years, so he does have experience with this type of asset. He will provide more info if a lender expresses interest. <br><br>Thanks,<br>AJ        </p>

          Here is what I asked him. His answers will follow.<br><br>1. What type of asset (i.e., MF, medical, retail, etc.) is currently under construction right now?   It is a mix of Condo Flats and Town Houses yes soled since the Bank stopped Funding which is about a year   <br>2. Where is this asset/construction located?   Northern N.J<br>3. What is the target (proforma) NOI?   It’s a sellout not rental project<br>4. What is the capital structure?   ?<br>5. What are the sources and uses? (Breakdown of how the funding will be used)   The funding will be used to pay off the existing bank and finish construction <br>6. What is the exit strategy?   Selling the units<br>7. How much funding are you needing? And for how long?   About 15M<br><br>Are his answers attractive enough to have me pursue this further?        </p>

          Hey Sal, I came across this post on a social media site and wanted to see if you might have any interest in it. I haven&#39;t contacted him yet, but here&#39;s what I know: <br><br>He&#39;s a builder/developer in TX looking to refinance an existing development. He needs $3.5mm on 350 lots that are (supposedly) valued over $7mm. <br><br>Should I or should I not pursue this?         </p>

          Dearest Sal, I was just emailed this morning by a sponsor who is looking for a $14M bridge loan to acquire and renovate 6 individual penthouse luxury condo units in Sarasota FL. Also as part of how the $14M will be used is to cover legal, administrative, and other fees. The sponsor wants to &#39;gut&#39; all the condos and renovate them to their highest potential. He is estimating the renovation costs to be between $100k - $150k each. --The exit strategy (this is what the sponsor wrote) is to sell the renovated units to buyers. Sales funds will be accumulated and Partners paid at pre-agreed dates. The GP may decide to pay Partners back ahead of schedule, if sufficient units are sold.-- So based upon the successful sale of these 6 penthouse condos, the proforma NOI is $15,734,900.00. The sponsor has also informed me that he has 10-12 LOI&#39;s from serious buyers. He can only get LOI&#39;s right now, because that is all FL law will allow at this point. He is a strong sponsor and has been doing condo conversions since 1970 (I have a brief bio on him with some examples he has done in past). <br><br>I was wondering if this scenario is fundable or not?         </p>

          AJ &amp; Sal, I talked with this same guy a little over a week ago after he submitted his contact info on my website. He started trying to convince me of how a great deal it was and he went off on a tangent stating that he had 41 years &quot;experience&quot; in the business. My gut feeling was that he was not going to have enough skin in the game because $250k was all he was willing to put into the deal. After that I told him that I couldn&#39;t help, we ended the conversation there.  Maybe I didn&#39;t research this one as thoroughly as I should have? Let me know if you had the same outcome.        </p>

          Tony: Not enough meat for me to chew on here.

          Tony,<br><br>That is correct. His experience was questionnable (his first deal was 41 years ago and he had only dabbled since then). His cash input was less than 2% of the requested loan amount (having already spent this on fees, appraisals, attorneys etc). He wanted 100% financing so this was a pass. James        </p>

          Hey Sal, I have a question in regards to utilizing your syndication program to form our own fund. I know that there are a few other students of yours in here that are involved with residential housing; short sales, REO flipping and rehabs, who may possibly be wondering the same thing I am. <br><br>Let&#39;s say we just formed our own fund for residential lending. Since my partners and I are involved with short sales and transactional funding* is supposedly the way to go in order to get these deals closed because of seasoning requirements given by the lender, would there be any of conflict of interest (state, federal, SEC) if we were to borrow money out of our own fund and pay everything back including interest? <br><br>*45-90 day transactional funding is now sometimes a little difficult to get as a few &quot;C&quot; buyers have backed out of the deal (not necessarily ours, just what some transactional lenders experiences have been).         </p>

          AJ: Bernie Madoff went to jail because he &#39;borrowed&#39; from his own fund and gave everyone and IOU. The best way for you to do this is to raise money around the idea of funding other folks&#39; deals. Self-dealing can get you in big trouble. Big trouble. <br>You&#39;re on the wrong track with a good idea. Switch it up and you&#39;ll be OK. *Moral of the Story: If your gut tells you it&#39;s wrong, it probably is.*         </p>

          I just got in touch with a lady, via social media, who I believe is a broker and possibly an attorney - or was an attorney at some point - that has some clients in need of funding. One of her clients in particular has two separate deals that need funding; 1) A flagged hotel in Southern CA needing $3 mil for a refi and 2) this person is filing a Ch. 11 BK on another asset, an LLC. This is all of I have for right now. She is asking me some questions that I feel I cannot answer correctly. Here is her email to me:<br><br>Property is a flagged hotel in Southern CA, with about 75% occupancy rate on average.<br>Client is filing a Chapter 11 BK for another property, which is an LLC.<br>What is the approximate rate, costs &amp; fees? And are broker&#39;s fees capped?<br>If all good, what do you need for submission? And how long will it take?<br>How is this lender different to others? What is your soft spot as I have many other potential clients?<br><br>I believe I can answer her question of &quot;what is the approximate rate, costs, &amp; fees?&quot; with... &quot;our competitive rates are more flexible than most hard money lenders out there. Our interest rates start at 11% and go up to 16% and our committment fees are between 4-6 points.&quot; .... As far as the broker&#39;s fees go, should I ask her if she has a signed agreement with the borrower already and for what percentage? If she has a signed brokers fee agreement with the borrower, should I tell her that her fee will be included in the term sheet we present to them?<br><br>As far as what documents we need for flagged hotels, they would be 2010-11 P&amp;L, T-12, and borrower PFS? Am I missing anything? I understand that as long as everyone is cooperative in the exchange and review of the shared and needed information to fund this deal, can I reply back that we can provide a term sheet within 14-21 days to the borrower to either accept or decline? <br><br>I&#39;m not sure how to respond to her last two questions...<br><br>I apologize for the long message. Just want to reply back with accurate answers.<br><br>Thanks!<br>AJ <br>        </p>

          Sal: I was wondering if you have any friends that might be interested in funding a $139 million development deal of a golf and entertainment facility in the North suburbs of Chicago? I don&#39;t have all the details, he just sent me emailed this morning, via social media, asking if I could help out. I know that this is not within your parameters, however, you have mentioned to ask you to see if you may have a friend who would be interested. Which is my reason for asking. The gentleman requesting the funds is a local Chicago golf pro that has been playing for 32 years. He has also designed and built 2 of the top 10 world&#39;s best golf facilities and managed one of them for 14 years. This is all I know for right now. If you don&#39;t know of anyone who would be interested, that&#39;s ok. I may have another contact in the Netherlands who does lend on development projects like this.  Thanks.         </p>

          AJ: Golf is a notoriously money losing enterprise. Golf Pros make poor operators. No one in the Western Hemisphere will fund this type of development. Perhaps 5-6 years ago. Not today. Politely tell him &quot;no&quot;, and find some other deals. Don&#39;t tell him &quot;No one in the Western Hemisphere&quot;, that is a joke between you, I and the rest of the Dandrew Community.         </p>

          Hey Sal, I definitely respect you, your knowledge, and your team. However, I thought golf courses were still doing pretty good these days and are still making a profit? Are there not a lot of people playing golf these days? Are golf courses not the number one spot to make business deals still? <br><br>I did tell Tom Paxton, the local Chicago golf pro, that we do not lend on development projects and we focus primarily on lending on income producing properties that fall within our specific lending parameters. I don&#39;t think he viewed my website stating which eligible properties we will lend on. He just sent me an email about the golf facility that is income producing and has been around since 1963. He sent me a lot of stuff actually... info on the facility, an executive summary, a bio of himself, and some other info. He&#39;s looking for a $9.4 mil bridge loan. Supposedly for the last 5 years the NOI has been between $495k to $1 mil... <br><br>How should I respond back to him?          </p>

          Hey Sal, I was wondering if you have any friends who do residential funding? We have an approved short sale where the homeowner is receiving a full satisfaction. The property is located just north of Houston. The bank has agreed to a $515,000 purchase price. So $515,000 is what we will need and will only need this funding for 60-90 days as we have potential end buyers that are very interested in this property. However, we have not had any of these end buyers come forth to draw up a contract yet. We are reselling this property at $599,000. A couple of weeks ago we had it listed at $659,000 and accumulated some interest. However, lowering the price has created more interest for a quick sale. <br><br>Normally we would go through our transactional funder for this type of deal to be funded. We got caught on this deal with Chase Bank because the negotiations went smoothly! Too smoothly! As I mentioned we got caught without our end buyer in place which is one of the top criteria our transactional funder requires before they fund our deal. Also because our transactional funder requires us to have an end buyer lined up before funding our deal, these homeowners are still facing FC on 4/5/11 (11 days away). We&#39;ve already asked and received 2 extensions from the bank, we&#39;re not sure if they will approve of a 3rd extension. We&#39;re looking into many avenues to help save this deal and the homeowners from going into FC, especially because we have successfully negotiated a full satisfaction for them. If you, or anyone reading this, know of someone who can help us please let me know. We can provide you a copy of the approval letter from the bank. <br><br>Thanks!<br>AJ         </p>

          Send me a email to jbalter@lonestarprivatecapital.com with your contact info. I have several resources.I can direct you to. The main thing with Short sales is as follows: has the short sale already been negotiated and approved? also, will the lender write down the loan balance to the purchase price.        </p>

          With the NDA form that you have provided at www.dandrewnda.com, do I fill in my name and email and request the link to e-sign it? Or do I have the person I&#39;m communicating with fill in their name and email to request the link to e-sign the form? <br><br>I&#39;m asking in regards to a gentlemen who has direct communication with numerous banks who are and need to sell their NPN&#39;s. I know and understand your policy of &quot;us&quot; needing direct communication with the bank in order to work with asset tapes. I will let him know that we must have direct communication with the bank. I will also find out his exact role (broker, intermediary, etc.) and how he gets compensated. He did mention that these banks pricing expectations are between 30% - 70% depending on location, occupancy, condition, etc. He also stated that he would like to talk with you directly and understand your parameters of what you&#39;re looking for, which I can answer that pretty easily. With that, he also mentioned that he wanted to get your &quot;template&quot; to send you the banks asset tapes directly. I&#39;m not sure what he means by template?? Email address? <br><br>Thanks,<br>AJ        </p>

          Earlier today I received an email from a gentleman, here in CO, who is looking for equity financing for his project. He owns a 6 acre parcel next door to the Major League Soccer Stadium. This project is located about 15 minutes NE of Denver, in an area that is growing and an area that I personally know pretty well. For the first part of his project (there are 4 phases) he is looking for $7.1mm in equity financing for 24 months. (I think, at this moment, he is in talks with a couple of local banks near his project about seeking a loan. They are telling him that he needs to raise more equity before they will lend to him. However, I don&#39;t think he has signed any paperwork yet.) This first part of phase one he wants to build a 46,000 sf Family Entertainment Center, a Brunswick Zone (bowling, billiards, arcades, etc.). The second phase, from what I read in the project overview, he wants to build another 46,000 sf Retail shopping area. The projected NOI for just ONLY the FEC Brunswick Zone in its first year is $1,182,000.00 annually. The sources and uses would be used to build the facility. They expect to start building this facility this year. They also expect to have the blueprints finalized here soon to start construction. The exit strategy is to seek permanent financing within 24 months to pay us off and show the new permanent lender that they are stable with a predictable cash flow. <br><br>In the project overview that I have it summarizes phases 3 &amp; 4 and also gives a brief history of the gentleman and his experience in building these types of projects. He has 30 years experience in building these kind of projects. He has an undergrad degree in business, engineering, architecture, and construction management from CSU. Also has an Executive MBA from DU. <br><br>I apologize about the length of this. My question is, would you be interested in this type of equity financing deal? If not, would you know someone that might be? If yes, I will ask this gentleman for some info on his recent/latest projects that can validate himself and his work, along with anything else you want to know about him and this project.         </p>

          I just got off the phone (he contacted me) with a gentleman who&#39;s employer is looking for mezzanine/equity financing beyond their available funding that they currently have now. This company, a very large company, has been around for 40 years and have converted over 45,000 units into condominimums. They buy existing apartment communities, highrises, and other real estate in desirable locations across the US. Then convert them into condos and resell them by price/sq.ft. based off of their market research for a profit. I am pretty sure you have heard of this company before. They are willing to have skin in the game. They are looking for additional funding. The gentleman I spoke with absolutely liked my pre-qualifying questions... I asked more than the 5 data points; 12 questions... he said I was asking the right questions and was getting straight to the point. I tried to get a specific scenario out of him. However, before he does give me that specific information, he wants to know if this is something we would like to lend on? This would be more than just one deal to lend on, it will be multiple deals over (hopefully) a long time. I also have a 114 page pdf file that gives an overview of their company if you would like to see it. This gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling and I think this might do the same for you as well. However, you&#39;re the boss and will determine that. Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks!  AJ         </p>

          AJ: I will tell you that 114 page PDF file is not something you will need to look at. <br><br>We would be interested in looking at this deal. The hold back is that the market for selling condo&#39;s is not the best right now. Is this something that he wants to do as an exit strategy? Tell me more on this post about the deal. What is the asset? What is the play, What is the asset. Just have him send over an executive summary with numbers.         </p>

          Hey Sal, I wanted to give you an update about this particular deal. I emailed the gentleman regarding his company&#39;s project needing equity financing, outlining what we needed. He replied back with, &quot;Let me get back to you. The original deal we looked at after further digging did not do economic justice. I will only present you with deals that make sense. We are working on a few others. As soon as I have details I will talk to you and answer questions.&quot; <br><br>I will follow up with him in 2-3 weeks and see where they are at with their other projects if he doesn&#39;t contact me before then.         </p>

          AJ: Thanks for this. Remember that this is a great learning experience for you and will add to your confidence facing off with similar folks in the future. Ask Corey how many deals he looked at that were sold as being &#39;fantastic&#39; but were really terrible. He&#39;s been working on a Continuing Ed for a month now taking a dud deal to the limits to see how far he could go with it, strictly for entertainment/educational value for the newer folks.         </p>

          Let&#39;s say I posted an ad on a social media website promoting our bridge lending services and someone comes along and posts a question asking, &quot;are you a direct lender?&quot; Should I reply back saying that I am an intermediary that represents a direct lener? Just curious because from what I see the people who are looking for financing want to deal directly with the lender and not so much with an intermediary.         </p>

          I have a quick question, do we provide &quot;equity&quot; loans to someone who is looking for an equity partner to purchase property? I just saw a post on a site about this and wanted to ask before I called this person. So if we do provide equity loans I will get the meat for you to chew on.         </p>

          No I&#39;m not currently taking the Syndication course. Although that would be a great course to get into as we have a Realtor in TX wanting us to set up a fund for his investors looking for funding to purchase REOs. My dad and I would like to talk to you about this some time. In regards to the equity post I am referring to, this person laid out a somewhat detailed post. He has 3 different portfolios, 2 of which he gives the amount of equity needed, investors profits over 5 year period, and projected IRR (I understand that this is same as proforma) and the 3rd one in NC they would be buying the note for about 52 cents on the dollar (would have to confirm that). This person states that their client has done all of their due diligence required on all 3 of the these portfolios (1st portfolio in Houston, 2nd in Orland and Tampa, FL areas, 3rd in NC doesn&#39;t state which market just on the beach.) If you&#39;d like I can copy and past this post and forward over to you through James to see if this is something I can call on?         </p>

          Hey Sal, you&#39;re gonna love this.... I just had someone forward over another equity deal on a social media site... I should probably sign up for this syndication program, huh! I think I need to forward this email over to you and have you or someone there take a look at it and help me break it down to see if we can do this. If this deal is something we can work on together, maybe take the program out of my portion of the deal earnings?? Let me know if you would me to forward the email over. Thanks         </p>

          I would *strongly suggest* that you sign up for the Syndication Course. I&#39;v added a lot of valuable tools to it and this is something that will make you look very smart and the go to person to get these deals funded. If the Realtor came to you to set up a fund with *his/her* investors, then you are looking at a tremendous opportunity. <br><br>Submit a help ticket at www.dandrewhelpdesk.com to get signed up.         </p>

          Over the past few months I have been approached by two different agents who have access to the FDIC and can acquire approved residential bulk REO asset tapes. I understand that you prefer us to be direct with the lender when acquiring asset tapes so we can manage their expectations better. I wanted to briefly explain each scenario with each agent to get an idea if Dandrew would be interested in this or not. <br><br>First agent, in CO, has a direct contact with FDIC and can acquire a tier 1 asset tape in a moments notice. Would Dandrew be interested in this scenario? Another question, if you are interested, how would this work out for the agent as far as getting compensated? Would the FDIC pay a commission to the agent? Or would I have to pay a referral fee?<br><br>Second agent, in TX, has a contact with another agent in CA who has the direct access to FDIC. This seems more like a daisy chain scenario, however, the agent in TX IS willing to step aside and allow us to be in direct contact with the agent in CA. The agent in TX would like a referral fee though. (Of course. Who wouldn&#39;t?) Would Dandrew be interested in this scenario as long as the agent in TX is willing to step aside to make the deal go through? <br><br>Also, this agent in TX is the agent that I was telling Corey about 2 days after my dad and I got back home from your event last Oct. This agent was asking if we, my dad and I, had a fund set up or could set up a fund for Residential bulk REOs. Supposedly this TX agent has 100+ asset managers on speed dial. He also has many bulk REO investors that are looking for funding. This TX agent says that he can get us 15% interest all day long from his investors looking for funding. I don&#39;t know how true that is though. Is there any way I can talk to you about setting up a fund for us to do this? This is the second time he has asked us about this.<br><br>Thanks.<br>AJ        </p>

          AJ<br>We have been down this road before countless times and God knows I will never see all the time wasted in chasing FDIC deals.<br><br>However, I did learn to stay away from them. You are better off working with banks that are in need of moving their own balance sheet. Not too mention, a lot of the stuff the FDIC sells is rough product. Other banks pick up the good assets from the failed banks.<br><br>Now regarding REO funding, that might be somehting we can provide through one of our investors. We would need more information though...        </p>

          Ok thanks. I will let them know politely that we are not interested in doing FDIC deals. <br><br>In regards to the REO fund, I&#39;m not sure what kind of information you are looking for. I don&#39;t know what kind of questions I should ask either. All I know is that if we are to set up this fund this TX agent would need to give us a test run, so to speak, before he promotes our services to his investors and starts calling his asset managers. When this was first brought to our attention last Oct. my dad had spoken to him about this. I do remember that this agent does have experience doing these types of deals. As far as figuring out the information that I need to find out for you and your investor friend to see if setting up this fund is feasible or not, please let me know how we can communicate best. Either on here, via email, or over the phone.<br><br>Thanks        </p>

          On a side note Peter, I sent over an asset tape about a month ago from a smaller bank in PA. James informed me that PA is not Dandrew&#39;s preferred state to work in, however, he did also say that he forwarded the tape over to you for review. Even though this tape is coming from PA, I was wondering if I can get update from you as to what you&#39;re doing with this tape? I don&#39;t know your process on how you handle tapes. If you prefer to reply back via email I believe James has my personal email address. If not, let me know.  Thanks.         </p>

          AJ, Keep in mind that just because the bank is in PA doesn&#39;t mean their assets are in PA. I would suggest to re-send it so we don&#39;t have to look back at all of the emails.        </p>

          Thanks Sal. I understand your point. However, it&#39;s not necessarily my ego that needs to be fluffed. Most RE agents are &quot;poo-flingers&quot; and will say this is the greatest deal ever and will throw anything and everything at you and tell you that it needs to be closed right away so they can make a quick fast buck. Just had this type of scenario happen this last week with a resi deal. We didn&#39;t go through with it because we had an uneasy feeling about it. And to answer your question &quot;yes&quot; I WANT and NEED to make money... Just got done going through all of the modules and manual for a second time. Will probably go through them again in a few months.         </p>

          I need some advice on how to respond back to this lady. I just met her on LinkedIn a couple of days ago. She&#39;s over in the LA area and does smaller commercial lending, $20-500K. She does come across deals that fit our parameters that she can potentially refer to us. Here are her questions:<br><br>How long has the company been in business? How long has it been providing bridge loans? How many loans were funded in the past year? Can you provide references to those who received funding? You state prefer recourse, does that mean you can provide non-recourse as well? If so, what are the requirements?<br><br>Up to this point I have been telling her my company specializes in making bridge loans... this is our parameters and terms.... do I tell her that &quot;I am a brand new company and to be honest with you sometimes I am a principal and sometimes I am an intermediary that works with a large hedge fund in NY. The hedge fund that I closely work with has been providing bridge loans since 2002. (I&#39;m not sure how many loans Dandrew made last year.) Again, to be honest with you I cannot provide you with references as I have signed confidentiality agreements that contains personal information and need to remain confidential. I&#39;m sure you can understand and appreciate that. (I&#39;m not sure how to respond back to her recourse question.)...?&quot; something like this?         </p>

          Your response is great.  You can sign a CA (confidentiality agreement) with her if you like. If a deal fits within our parameters, let&#39;s get the five data points and see how we can fund the deal.        </p>

          Thanks. Can you give an approximated number of how many bridge loans Dandrew made last year? And how can I reply back to her recourse question? .... Do we provide non-recourse as well? If so, what are the requirements?         </p>

          Something to the verbiage:<br>&quot;You work with a HML that has closed over $200mm in the past few years. Every commercial deal is different (non-recourse meaning we can only go after the collateral and nothing else). Some deals require a PG (personal guarantee). It depends on location, quality, type, dscr with current and proforma numbers. Since I don&#39;t want to speak in general terms, send me over a specific scenario with the five data points and I can better answer your question.&quot;        </p>

          Hey Sal, last week I was telling you about a Realtor and her fiance wanting to expand the fiance&#39;s business. Matt, the fiance, owns a trucking company. He will be expanding into WY, just outside of Cheyenne near the newly discovered oil lake; the Bakken Shale is what it is called I believe. He has just recently signed a contract with Exxon Mobil for about $1.8mm - $1.9mm. He will be heading up to his new work site on 4/6/11 to start working. As he just recently signed this contract with Exxon Mobil he is looking to get this funding as soon as possible. He&#39;s requesting a loan amount of $350,000 for a 3 year term; (sources and uses) $250,000 to purchase equipment and $100,000 for working capital. His exit strategy is to payoff the requested loan amount within that 3 year term. He is also willing to cross-collateralize an industrial building that he is financing. The current market value for this industrial building is around $900,000 - $950,000. <br><br>As far as the current business that he owns and operates his<br>NOI: $2.1mm<br>Pro NOI: $2.1mm<br>Debt 1: $199,000; US Bank<br>Debt 2: $203,000; US Bank<br>With his current debt he is 3 years into a 5 year term.<br><br>I understand that this loan request is not what you normally work with. However, if you are interested in funding this please let me know. If not, is there someone that you know that may be interested in funding this? I also understand that this is a small deal and I will only get a little bit out of this. However, what&#39;s more important to me is helping my Realtor friend and her fiance, getting my first funding deal done, and getting the confidence that I NEED to grow my business and become a deal junkie. <br><br>I appreciate your time in reading this, any advice that you may give, and any referrals that you may give!<br>Have a great day!<br><br>AJ         </p>

          AJ: This deal is not going to be the way you become successful. You&#39;re going to need to look at deals that fit our funding criteria which will give you success and then you will contract the Deal Junkie disease. <br>This is not a deal. Its a friend of yours  and unfortunately, they are going to spend a lot of your time getting you to turn a turkey into an eagle. This isn&#39;t what you want to hear, i know. But I need to be truthful with you and make sure you&#39;re focused on the *right* deals and not the charity deals. <br>Grow your business by marketing for deals that will get funded, not out of the box random stuff that won&#39;t. <br><br>So, politely tell them no and move on and focus on marketing for deals that will get funded. They are better off going to a local bank.         </p>

          This thread must be from &quot;The Other AJ&quot;.  I received an email from someone today who read this post and thought it was me.  AJ, maybe you could email me your contact info at AJ@JLRcap.com, and I&#39;ll get you in touch with them.  I do wish you luck with this, and I may be able to encourage you with this...ever since I&#39;ve met him, when Sal gave me advice, he&#39;s been right on.  I&#39;ll look forward to your email.<br><br>Also, it might be helpful to use your last name in your profile display...that way we won&#39;t be so easily confused.  AJs are always unique...as we should be!<br><br>-AJ Palmgren<br><br><br>        </p>

          Not enough meat to chew on. Where did you find this deal? What is their receivables ($ per year). <br>If it&#39;s a small company, don&#39;t waste your time. Must have operating income over $2mm a year. <br><br>In all seriousness, we really want you to focus on &#39;plain vanilla&#39; commercial real estate deals.         </p>

          Thank You for your response. I understand that this deal may not suit &quot;us&quot; and our lending parameters, however, you, Sal, have said during the seminars that we have attended not to be afraid to send over deals outside of the wheelhouse as you have a Rolodex full of contacts who may be interested. So with that, this is why I am asking you about this. This deal was &quot;brought to us&quot; by one of our residential Realtors that we are working with. Her and her fiance are looking to expand their business. They wanted to know if we would work with them in helping them. I can use our criteria to find out this information and send it over. Is there any additional questions that I may need to ask? Or if you know someone who may be interested in this and has their own criteria, what is their criteria of questions that I need to ask?<br><br>Thanks!<br>AJ        </p>

          AJ: You are absolutely correct. I have said that. However, the caveat is that it has to fit strict and stringent pre-qualification criteria. Big businesses. With real balance sheets. Not mom-and-pop businesses. <br><br>The fact that it&#39;s a Realtor looking to expand her business sounds ominous and I would say to her &quot;pass, no thank you&quot;. <br><br>        </p>

          Hi Sal, I wanted to see if you would be interested in this Ch. 11 reorganization deal. It&#39;s pretty complicated to explain as this person owes quite a bit of money to quite a few people. I have a bunch of articles that were forwarded over to me by a broker that I am working with. She wanted to know if we work with Ch. 11&#39;s and I said yes. With the complexity of this I wanted to find out from you if you wanted me to send over articles to deals@ for you to read and say yes or no in wanting my broker to refer us to this person. Normally I would do what you ask me to do, find out the 5 data points, however, this situation is pretty complicated. Please let me know if you would like for me send over the articles that I have. Thanks!<br>AJ         </p>

          AJ: There is not a single Ch. 11 that is not complicated. However the only question I have is *is this a real estate deal?* <br><br>The word real estate never appeared in your posting so I don&#39;t know what you want us to do. <br><br>The 5 data points is all we need. No articles or propaganda needed. Just the facts.         </p>

          Yes sir it is a real estate deal, a portfolio of mixed use properties worth approximately $44 million. I will get on this! Thanks Sal! Have a great weekend! AJ        </p>

          This real estate portfolio involves land that is partially developed... would you be interested in this piece as well? If so, I will find out if they have all the proper and necessary permits needed for development.         </p>

          Of course it has land that is partially developed. Most of these Ch. 11 deals will have busted developments in them. Send it over and we&#39;ll review.         </p>

          Monthly payments are simple interest, meaning take the loan amount x .15 (or any interest rate) then divide by 12. <br><br>So a monthly *interest only* payment on a 5mm loan would be $62,500.<br><br>As you get more educated and experienced, I would suggest that you get http://www.realestatemathmadeeasy.com<br><br>It was put together by a good friend of mine, Cameron Dunlap and he teaches you how to use the HP IIB calculator easily. <br><br>This will be expecially important when you&#39;re asked to provide pricing for notes to banks looking to sell their loans.         </p>

          Hey Sal, <br><br>I was asked to place this question on here. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ll be able to help me with this particular part; however, I&#39;m working on creating an &quot;Operating Agreement&quot; for my LLC. Since, I will be an intermediary for you, I&#39;m not quite sure on how to word the &quot;purpose&quot; of my company. This is what I&#39;m thinking of saying as the purpose... The purpose of this company is to assist qualified sponsors in seeking discretionary capital through a private third party capital fund. <br><br>Thanks, AJ        </p>

          I don&#39;t know if you need a Operating Agreement if its just going to be you. If you are just collecting funds from us doing deals, you don&#39;t need an Operating Agreement. <br><br>Operating Agreements are like pre-nups; if something goes wrong, what are the remedies? And only used with partnerships. <br><br>Why do you think you need a &quot;doc&quot;?         </p>
