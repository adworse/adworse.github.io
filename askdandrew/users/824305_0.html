          Will you do bridge loans to purchase commercial NPNs for the purpose of either restructuring the debt with the business owner or acquiring the property from the business owner and refinancing? On the Dandrew Private Lending website, it says that you will buy a note if there is seller carry back but nothing about lending to buy NPNs. My South Florida partner has a great relationship with the newly promoted Head of Distressed Commercial Assets in all of Florida. We are looking to build up this part of the business while the iron is hot. This could end up being bulk pools or one offs. My guess is that you will lend for the bulk pools but what about the one offs?        </p>

          Darlene: I think I may answered this, but we will look at anything with a good, low basis. Basis meaning purchase price vs value. <br><br>*For example*: if I find a 1 oz gold coin on eBay for $600, and the price of gold is $1,700, then I&#39;m buying that gold on eBay at a great, low basis. <br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal, I am direct with a seller of bulk residential non-performing firsts. Their average BPO on this last pool was $44,000 with a total BPO value of $16.7 MM. They advertise to us pre-qualified buyers that they will accept 40% of BPO for the pool. They also have somewhat worked pools in which they have already worked out loan mods and deeds in lieu on many in the pool. Same price point. Would you or Dave be interested in this kind of pool or is the price point too low?.        </p>

          Sal, will you do bridge loans to purchase NPNs on distressed commercial properties? The Dandrew Private Lending website says you will but notes with seller carry back but I didn&#39;t find anything about loans to purchase the notes. My South Florida partner has a great relationship with the newly appointed Head of Commercial Distressed Assets in all of Florida and we are looking to build up this part of the business while the iron is hot. My guess is that you would potentially buy bulk pools of assets but what about one off bridge loans for the purpose of restructuring the debt with the business owner or acquiring the business and refinancing.        </p>

          Darlene: We&#39;ve re-directed the DandrewPrivateLending.com website to Dandrew Partners. <br><br>In a nutshell, the market and the environment has changed dramatically and the focus for us is to look at *any* commercial funding request objectively and structuring a solution around for the sponsor/borrower on a &quot;built to suit&quot; basis. <br><br>We look at any NPNs on commercial and I will tell you that 60% of our business are those deals where a borrower has been asked by their lender to buy back their note at a discount. <br><br>*At the end of the day, its all about the level we get into this deal at.*         </p>

          Hello Sal,<br>I have a question about Dave Gordon&#39;s minimum $2 million investments that he is willing to make with seasoned real estate investors. Forgive me but I rather have you answer my simple questions so that I can jump right into business with Dave. Every time someone asked him a question in Vegas about the structure or terms of his deals with us, he said he had sent you that information. If that is available somewhere, please let me know. Otherwise, I&#39;d be happy to help you organize that for the group if you like.<br><br>I have a couple of very experienced real estate investors with whom I spoke about Dave Gordon&#39;s minimum $2MM investment to scale up their businesses. Dave said he&#39;s not looking for the guys who are doing 1-3 houses/month; he&#39;d like to target the guys doing 10-30 houses/month. The ones I am targeting fit that description and are very successful. They target uninvolved private money lenders or investors with $50k or more that want to put their cash or IRA money into fix and flip or rental properties. You can imagine how well they do. I would like to figure out whether Dave&#39;s fund could be a win win for all of us before wasting too much of everyone&#39;s time. Here are some of the key questions they have asked me and a draft of my responses. Your feedback is much appreciated. Please check for accuracy as well. I don&#39;t ever want to say anything that is not true.<br><br>I assume that these deals will come out of the same fund that invests in pools of assets. Is that true or is it a separate fund? My answers assume that is the case.<br><br>Here are some of the questions they have asked me:<br><br>1. What is the size of the fund?<br>Answer: The fund has several hundred million dollars and is an evergreen fund that can continually tap into more institutional money. To give you an idea of the scope of the fund, they are typically buying and managing pools of REOs and notes of $20-150 MM or more. (Check for accuracy. Dave mentioned deals of this size that he was working on.)<br><br>2. What type of investments does the fund invest in?<br>Answer: Typically, the fund is investing in pools of assets from the larger banks. The fund also has money invested in bonds. The fund manager is now expanding their scope to include high volume real estate investors for whom an additional $2MM or more would help the investor scale up their business to the next level.<br> <br>2. What is their expected yield? What has been their historical yield?<br>Answer: It has been a highly performing fund with &gt; 20% yield. I cannot speak to the expected yield with an investment in your company until we better understand how your business works. I approached you with this idea only because you are highly successful. The win win would be if the additional financial resources would help you scale up your business to an even higher level.<br><br>3. What will be the terms for the at least $2MM?<br>Answer: TBD depending on how you would use the funds and for how long. Note: I&#39;d love a more direct answer if one exists because no one wants to waste their time for a deal that will never pan out.<br><br>4. What is my role with the fund?<br>Answer: I work directly with the fund manager to help find investment opportunities for the fund through my relationships. I work with them as an independent contractor.<br><br>Sal, thanks for your input. Let me know if I can help to get the A team targeting better deals for Dave&#39;s money.<br><br>Darlene<br>415-699-7116        </p>

          Darlene: I would suggest contacting Paula at admin@dandrewpartners.com and setting up a call with these folks and Gordon and I for next week (Oct 8th). Although I know a lot about Dave&#39;s fund, I can&#39;t really speak about it as its not mine and I&#39;m not a pricipal in that. I&#39;m sure you know what I mean. Let&#39;s just keep it going with a conf call as a next step so we don&#39;t confuse these guys and injure your credibility.         </p>
