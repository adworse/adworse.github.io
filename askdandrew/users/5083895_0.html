          Hello Everyone,<br><br>Well, this is my third posting today.  In particular, one at the Syndicator Group.<br><br>I need to find some money to rearrange my debt.  I have good income, some assets, but current debt is not structured well.<br><br>Besides my other posts, this one might put that into perspective.<br><br>Here is a spreadsheet that I want to use to find the money I need.  At the bottom, is my residence, and two other properties that I don&#39;t yet own, but are &#39;chits&#39; to be used, contributed by my motivated, compliant seller.  841 Flory Mill is the one I am ultimately interested in acquiring(www.florymill.com).  Ostensibly, 10 N Market is to be used as a 1031 &#39;relinquished property&#39;, with either 841 Flory Mill or 572 N Plum to be the &#39;target property(ies).<br><br>Doesn&#39;t have to be a 1031 exchange, and I don&#39;t even need to use 10 N Market: perhaps, if all properties except my residence are used, then there might be enough value (since $455,000, or so on a Mill new first is too small a deal) that Dandrew could now extend a credit facility, or refinance them with the cash-out, with which to consolidate.<br><br>Thanks for helping me figure out how to use what I have to do what I need to do.  My current income from all sources is currently about $13,000/ month.  I&#39;d like at least $100,000 left over for me for consolidation, the rest for final acquisition of the Mill, and reserves for its operation.<br><br>I figure the expertise to solve this puzzle is here at Dandrew.<br><br>Hope this opens:<br><br>LIST OF 8.pdf<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Greg Smith<br><br><br>        </p>

          I am having trouble navigating the site.  Sal wanted to answer me on AskDandrew.  I didn&#39;t even know where to do it, and it disappeared into Commercial Triage.  I need to find out how to structure a personal deal, so that once that is out  of the way, I can have the leeway to further pursue my work as an Intermediary (AvantiCapitalServices.com).  I will try to add the thread here.  Before that, is there a phone #?  Okay, here goes:<br>Put this on AskDandrew and I’ll answer it there.<br> <br>Thanks<br>Sal<br> <br>From: Greg [mailto:avanti3@mac.com] <br>Sent: Tuesday, March 25, 2014 6:03 PM<br>To: Buscemi, Salvatore M.<br>Subject: Re: 33487.goinetusa.com (Triage Submission2)<br> <br>Thank you, Sal, for getting right to this.<br> <br>I would like to say, that perhaps with expert guidance, this could be made viable, despite the small size of the deal.<br> <br>I know that Lancaster County is not tier one, but it IS one of the wealthier counties in the US, with a varied economy (industry &lt;publishing, defense, floors &amp; ceilings, transportation hub, etc&gt;, agriculture &lt;12th most fertile, non-irrigated land in the world&gt;, and tourism &lt;PA Dutch&gt;) with low unemployment.  It makes me think then, should I go through the motions to be an Intermediary?<br> <br>Of course this is where I live, so this is primarily where I&#39;d try to drum up business.  If this is a week area, then what to do . . .<br> <br>Though my deal is small, it would be strong, and I&#39;d look for guidance as well as capital to realize at least a  modicum of success.<br> <br>With yesterday&#39;s showing of the Mill to the brew/pub people I saw a way for them to be stronger at the bank for their project (though I may be wrong, I had learned a while back that a very long term lease = ownership type stability in the eyes of the conventional lender) and with such a lease in hand, I too would be stronger at the bank for the refinance.<br> <br>Do I fool myself with my thinking?  Is this a COGO deal (I learned of Lee Arnold through your organization)?<br> <br>I apologize for being so wordy, but I was so hopeful<br> <br> <br> <br>On Mar 25, 2014, at 6:31 PM, Buscemi, Salvatore M. wrote:<br><br><br>Pass. <br> <br>No Lancaster. We know the area and it&#39;s not a market for us. <br> <br>Also, this looks complicated as a entirely repurposed deal. Not value added.

          Still working on this project.  Will maybe have a web site next week (Flory-Mill.com) put together by Marc Boucher at iNet.  So, it is a small deal, I understand this.  Yet I will be holding myself out as a Banker, seeking/placing larger sums of money, but can&#39;t manage to find myself this small amount for my office building?  I&#39;m taking it &#39;subject to&#39;, and now am thinking that a mezz piece should be put on it to bring it up to 65% LTV, or so (150,000 mezz).  Alternatively, would a new conventional first to 65% (about $420k) make sense - with a letter of credit to take to the bank? (Won&#39;t pass muster at conventional lenders on my own, otherwise, at present.  I do have good income, but need to consolidate (with part of the 150,000) to rebuild my score) - then my 10,000 to 14,000/mo will suffice.  I need this consolidation/working capital sooner rather than later.  I NEED HELP to figure this out in order to put it behind me.  So that I can concentrate on business, and stop treading water.        </p>

          Greg<br><br>The problem with this is that it&#39;s not a desirable asset (a mill) in a part of the nation that is considered to be a legacy of the rust belt (Lancaster County) where the key event has to be executed on a make-or-break situation for the deal to be successful. <br><br>So, to be frank, you are infatuated with a deal that makes no sense to anyone - primarily because its in your hometown or close to your home. Its also because you&#39;ve not done much marketing to find these deals as your LinkedIn profile (as we discussed before in response to another post of yours) isn&#39;t set up yet. <br><br>Running a correlation to this, I live in NYC and we don&#39;t do deal sin NYC as they mostly too competitive in our backyard, therefore, we go to other areas of a country. <br><br>I hope this helps. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Everything helps, thanks.<br><br>I was getting involved with this little building before signing up with Dandrew, and yes it is as if I am buying a house to live in.  Just a personal RE acquisition.<br><br>I know that I, too, should do as you and get business from elsewhere.  I haven&#39;t started a push yet.  Web site has been set up, I&#39;m working on LinkedIn, and I&#39;m preoccupied with this building and my other properties and with my day &#39;job&#39;.<br><br>Rust belt?  The largest component to the local economy is TOURISM because of the Amish and other PA Dutch attractions.  A lot of New Yorkers &amp; Jersey-ites visit here for that (perhaps you did).  Then comes AGRICULTURE - the most productive county in the US (non-irrigated - Fresno &amp; Salinas Counties in CA do more, but each is 10 times larger and require water to be brought in, and then they can grow all year).  Next comes INDUSTRY - printing, defense, machinery, etc. (RR Donnelley, Case New Holland, Armstrong World Industries, Harley Davidson - next county over)  In other words, unemployment is low because of the economy&#39;s diverse and varied industries.  It is a very wealthy county - mostly not ostentatious, with a low cost of living.<br><br>I might be able to tap into monied investors from the area, if not local deals, once established.<br>----------------------------<br>Having said all that, I wouldn&#39;t mind help in at least structuring my personal deal, or, if I can find some private money on my own, to do the paperwork professionally.<br><br>I am not looking for money, per se, by all my entreaties.  Just expert advice (which you have given, granted)<br><br>You don&#39;t need to respond to this, I get the message, and I appreciate your having looked at my concerns.<br><br>Take care,<br><br>Greg<br><br><br>        </p>

          Greg, <br><br>Lancaster aside, I think its best you get the Commercial Real Estate Capital Syndicator. If you&#39;re passionate about this deal, you&#39;re going to need to learn how to raise money around one-off deals. <br><br>Here&#39;s why, any advice I tell you will lead to more questions and then more questions. So you&#39;re probably better off learning this from the get go. And use SALISMYPAL and you&#39;ll get 30% off. <br><br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=434<br><br>I will tell you that one of my rules is to look at the number and the deal dispassionately. If you can prove this to the investors, you will get the money you need. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Haven&#39;t been a social media user.  Did have an unused LinkedIn account and I updated the email (greg@AvantiCapitalServices.com) and added a photo.  Was hoping to learn more of the nuts and bolts of LinkedIn with the LinkedIn Leaders, but I see I needed to bring more to the table.  So, I bought a book, &quot;My LinkedIn&quot; (Rutledge), and am muddling through it as I have time.  Any suggestions to shorten the learning curve to get up and running? Sorry for my ignorance.         </p>

          Thanks, Sal.  I guess that I am dense - I assumed that it required coordination with a LinkedIn account.  I want to know how to utilize L-Leaders alone, unless I misunderstand you.  Might there be a tutorial? BTW, my L-In URL, as it is now: &lt;www.linkedin.com/pub/greg-smith/46/307/1ab&gt;        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I resent it to you as you requested, knowing that it is not even finished.  I&#39;ll get more info in there ASAP.  As far as putting L-L in there, I don&#39;t know enough how to do that just yet, as I said I&#39;m looking for guidance to do that.  I will visit the LinkedIn Leaders site again to see if that is addressed there (in case I overlooked it).  Then I will go to the help desk to get help, if need be, so as not to bother you with this.  When done, then you can polish it up if you&#39;d like (I did buy LinkedIn Leaders).<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Greg        </p>

Is it the idea to connect to all those &#39;Leaders&#39; links?  Have a quick look if you can.

          Is this analysis correct?:<br>In the &quot;How To Structure A Syndication Deal&quot; video (Overview Video - Content Bonus), wasn&#39;t that an 8.33 cap rate, vice 10%?  To explain, If that NOI of $30,000 is a monthly figure, then $360,000/yr gives a value of 3.6MM in order to obtain a 10 cap (10 x 360,000 = 3,600,000).  If you use a value of 3MM (as in the film), then if you divide the value (price?) of 3,000,000 by 360,000/yr NOI, then you would get an 8.33 cap.  Right?        </p>

          So Greg now I can tell you that this wasn&#39;t an appropriate question to ask here. That&#39;s a DandrewHelpDesk.com question. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          In the Capital Syndicator &quot;PB Student Syndication Pitch to Retail Investor&quot;, in both the pdf and the pp versions, under the heading &quot;leverage&quot; there is either a mistake, or missing info.  To wit: 10% of $1,000,000 is $100,000.  Unless the $50,000 was a 10% part of a $500,000 equity infusion, to buy a property with $500,000 in debt.  In which case, this leverage position should be noted lest the &#39;prospect&#39; that this info is intended for, be the one to catch this apparent error.<br><br>If it is in fact an error, and the 10% listed should be changed to 5%, then except for depreciation on the larger basis, the return on both situations presented in the example are only about $200 different from each other, vice $6000.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Here is my famous &#39;too small to fund personal deal&#39; again.  Here is the new website for the project: www.florymill.com.<br><br>I&#39;ve only completed three chapters of the Syndicator course, since buying it last week, but need to fund this project ASAP.  Can I syndicate the debt, providing interest ONLY to the investor(s)?  Might you and/or others in the Dandrew community be interested in participating?  Suggestions would be appreciated.  Want to complete the acquisition of this asset, set up reserves for it and consolidate personal debt.  Current &#39;stack&#39; only has a 1st (to be taken subject to) at 41% LTV.<br><br>With this done, then I can concentrate on deal flow . . .<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Greg Smith<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I&#39;ll do that on the call.  I should be through the Capital Syndicator info by then, and might be able to see a solution.<br><br>It IS the same mill - just looking for expertise, that should be found at Dandrew, to get this done, if not to obtain the funding for it.  But, though it seems to me that the scale of this funding might be considered &#39;chump change&#39; - it certainly is not to me.<br><br>Thank you for your patience, don&#39;t mean to pester.<br><br>Greg        </p>
