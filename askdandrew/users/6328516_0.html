          Sorry Sal but the Assumption Deal Structure video has a few holes I need to plug. I apologize for the long winded following:<br><br>Hi Sal &amp; Corey,<br><br>This following is related to Module 4 Deal Assumption-Structure. I know it&#39;s the end of the month and I&#39;ve been forewarned that Sal gets cranky.  <br><br>I am somewhat savvy relating to the ownership transfer of the SPE memberships beneficial interests, however, a few  things were left to be answered. Here goes:<br><br>1.) Where&#39;s the bonus video with the wanna be genius that Corey called out? I&#39;m whining for more entertainment packed with SALutations. <br><br><br>2.) If the 5 data points look good, and the deal is stabilized, why would there be a willingness to transfer the membership interests? (Maturity?, why would the beneficiary want out? Why transfer the interest when the asset could be sold) or is this a CMBS asset non performing even though it meets the stabilized criteria of 75% or higher occupancy?  <br><br>3.) As you know, our sinister world has plenty of inherent deception and my concern would be that a Transferor might attempt an LLC membership interest transfer at the beneficiary LLC level instead of being at the SPE LLC level.  A small amount of time in the video could have been used to explain why the membership interest is substitued at the SPE LLC level versus being substituted at the current beneficiary LLC level. My point is that the current beneficiary LLC may have other assets that would need to be otherwise transferred out BUT MORE IMPORTANT IS THAT THE BENEFICIARY LLC MAY HAVE UNDERLYING UNWELCOME LIABILITIES that would become the headache of  the new owner................ and that is why we transfer membership interest at the SPE LLC level.<br><br>4.) Ok, so I show up at the deal killers office, so poor I can&#39;t even pay attention, the current beneficiary executes a membership interest transfer ( PLEASE PICK ONE --- by assignment? OR abandonment...... forget what the articles state for this discussion), we execute that (assignment or abandonment?) ....... now I can afford that nice shirt, tie and then........ what is recorded at the Secretary of State office..... if anything. The income stream now flows to me so where is the paper trail to get that corrected. It is my understanding from the video that the lender / servicer are not in the know at all. <br><br>5.) Now for the grand finale, based on your presentation in the video, it is my understanding that the Seller whom I got this gem from is still on the hook for the note and I have no financial liability or skin in the game whatsoever? Pinch me...... did I miss something? If the seller is still on the hook, who in their right sane mind would allow an unknown being to run an asset into the ground while still remaining on the hook for the note? Are you insinuating that the Dandrew Nation can pull this off on a regular basis and that these sellers are not represented by the typical deal killers that are obligated to represent the best interests of their client?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Allan           <br>        </p>

          Allan, <br><br>I’m going to answer these in the sequence you asked them. Great questions, here and I hope I reciprocated with thoughtful answers based on my experience. <br><br>1.	I am not sure what Corey promised (there’s a reason why he’s not been with us for a while…), however, I would put together any training video you need to put the pieces together of this puzzle. We recently spent a small fortune on lighting and other stuff to make the experience better. We’re also recording videos for *all* of the infographics and expect to have these done by March 2015. Just tell me *specifically* what you need. However, I did see a post that you found what you may have been looking for. You’ll have to forgive me as a) there are hundreds of videos I’ve recorded over the years and b) my screen view is different than yours so I don’t automatically see what you are referring to. <br><br>2. *Great question.* A lot of times that we’ve done this in the past it’s been because we’ve hit the Achilles tendon of the seller. And the assets were *not* always operating well and were on their way to being mismanaged. The operators got in over their head, they may have overpaid, and these CMBS loans have huge defeasances that make it prohibitive to refinance; and this could be seen as a double whammy. Most folks who bought didn’t know that they would have to pay close to or more than 10% pre-payment penalty. So the liability was huge. <br><br>(Allan, please don&#39;t assume that the weak, inexperienced operators who bought actually knew what the loan docs read...)<br><br>Reminds me of those COPD commercials with the elephants sitting on the person’s chest. Same thing. <br><br>(I&#39;m assuming you know what I&#39;m talking about above here as you stated you have experience here and if you do not know what I mean, please ask me.)<br><br>The asset may not have been able to have been sold as the NOI had decreased and the value of the property wouldn’t be enough to pay the loan + the defeasance + any brokers fees. <br><br>Also, sometimes as in the case of Mobile Home Parks, you can’t get financing for these. The asset simply isn’t as bankable. (Hint: that is a big opportunity…)<br><br>Whenever I hear of an out-of-state seller firing their management company to save a few bucks, I add this strategy into my plan of what I’m going to do to engineer the take-over of the asset.<br><br>I once worked for a family office that just wanted to sell some of their assets because they wanted to move into something else. It happens. <br><br>And going into 2015, you’ll see many people *wanting to sell* because they depreciated their assets to $0 and will have to pay a nasty tax bill. If not one is lending, well, this is where the creativity comes in. The other fire door when there is a fire in the movie theater is a sale. <br><br>All of this I’ve mentioned above has a cumulative effect. Its compounds.  <br><br>3. And that is why you always hire an attorney to do a UCC review on the asset and to execute the transaction to protect yourself. All sellers are liars until proven otherwise. Remember that… <br><br>4. By assignment. And your attorney (*not you*) will send a certified letter instructing them of any changes in the *PO Box* for all future notifications. If you don’t use a lawyer you’ll screw yourself because you’ll want someone to point the finger at if anything goes wrong. <br><br>Then again, you wouldn’t perform a prostate exam on yourself either, correct? Same here. <br><br>5. Ha! I love this one. There is no member of the Dandrew Nation that I know of – that I know of – who has acquired an asset with no money down using this strategy. *They have all had to raise a small amount of equity (aka “down payment” for the newbies) for the seller to be satisfied.* It’s easier than you think to raise money when people are parched for income. <br><br>I’m not saying it’s not possible - I&#39;ve negotiated this a couple of times myself for my own account and for a family office - but I have been working on a Continuing Ed/eBook/Infographic that sounds like this: *”5, 7, 10 Ways To Convince A Seller to Sell You His Commercial RE With No Money Down”*. <br><br>Would you think this would be beneficial to the Dandrew Nation? <br><br>Have I satisfied your intellectual curiosity here, Mr. Allan? What else is keeping you up at night? <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Thanks for equally creating a long winded response. Your are an incredible ??????? you know, there has to a word far above GURU, but that&#39;s what you are. To answer your questions,<br><br>Yes a  ”5, 7, 10 Ways To Convince A Seller to Sell You His Commercial RE With No Money Down”. would absolutely be beneficial to the Dandrew Nation. You should add that as a bonus to those would pledge their loyalty and promise not to run off and leave you to become mini Sal&#39;s with a bald spot. <br><br>Regarding my sleep at night, I can only close one eye while in training at Dandrew U. Dandrew is what&#39;s keeping me awake at night. I am feeding on this intellectual capital and I am warming up for what I hope to be a phenomenal 2015...... Thank you for that webinar email (landed in my SPAM folder) that shined a new light on bridging my intellectual capital into an area that I did not realize existed. This stuff is UFB, you are the man Sal.<br><br>Allan          </p>

          Allan, <br><br>It should be obvious that I eat, sleep and breathe this business. I love the capital markets and investment banking. <br><br>And I’ll see if I can pen these 5-7, #n Ways To Convince A Seller… This week. I’m supposed to be off, but I’ll draft some on the treadmill tomorrow. <br><br>And the bald spot comment made me laugh. <br><br>We have a lot more tools set to be released in 2015. 2015 is the year of the cutting edge tools that I’ve been testing over the past year for everyone. From capital raising to arbitrage, you’ll like what you see. And if I wasn’t passionate about this business, you wouldn’t be with us still, right? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Do know if this posted last night. If its redundant ........ all apologies.<br><br>Regarding Todd&#39;s deal. It was clear early on that the borrower wanted to play poker with Todd by showing his bluff relating to the single hard money offer he currently claimed he was able to execute on in two weeks. <br><br>Would it have been proper to respond as follows: I would have immediately called out the borrower upon identifying that another hard money source had given him a commitment. My response would have been: Show me your Term Sheet and if you can&#39;t, go do your shopping now, because if we issue a term sheet, you have 5 business days to accept and if you don&#39;t and choose to walk away, I can assure you that when you come back, you&#39;ll get 8 points up front and 16% interest (those extra point$ / $pread are mine). The bottom line, put up or shut up and don&#39;t waste my time. This is supply and demand 101. I certainly would be more tactful in my choice of words but the inherent message would be the same.<br><br>Also, regardless of whether this was a good deal or not, up front or during Todd&#39;s initial discussion with the borrower, while managing the borrowers expectations,  a very important fact should have (any may have) been discussed that should have proven to the borrower, despite a 12-14% interest rate, that he gets to now keep $XXXXX monthly in cash sweep profits that are now being directed to the lender. By not accepting these terms he is screwing himself and or other members, shareholders....... because their payout (dividend, distribution, etc...) is being diverted to the lender with absolutely no end in sight.<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Just one question regarding Phil&#39;s deal. Are there times when the buyer is in bed with the seller and the purchase price is pumped (within reason and could be supported by appraisal) so as to allow the buyer to recover a portion of his skin in the game when the transaction closes. If so, could this be an identifier that might say such a deal existed because the buyer was willing to pay $10k per door over the going market rate?<br><br>Example: Contract price is 10MM purchase but behind the scenes the real deal is 8MM and the buyer pulls back 2MM of his 3.5MM skin, resulting in the buyer only putting in 1.5MM which would also bring the $10k over price back into alignment with the market. Because the buyer was a CPA, experienced and saavy, there is no reasonable method of madness to pay a $10k premium per door....... especially when the buyer is truly a certified mathaholic.<br>        </p>

          Allan,<br><br>Yes. Of course. Sometimes horse trading goes on behind closed doors. Its not credible, and this is something that an experienced eye (either myself or some other institution) will pick up quickly (and possibly get blacklisted). <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Allan<br><br>Back in 2009 we had our own special servicing company as a legacy from another fund I once managed. We were buying NPN pools mostly from Bear Stearns and other holders of garbage. <br><br>Since then, we made the strategic choice that we would focus only on commercial and now have a Joint Venture agreement with Dave Gordon’s fund (AskDandrew Silver) for all of our Bulk Asset Pool buying (NPNs, RPN, REOs, Ps) so we do buy these, however, we invest alongside Dave Gordon and use his desk and servicing company to manage these deals. <br><br>That is what we call in our business “Arbitrage” and I believe you’re an Arbitrager. <br><br>Hope this clears this up. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Allan<br><br>The answer is no. Here’s why:<br><br>From the Institutional Side: These assets are the shake that’s been passed over. I’m going to make a bet and assume that most of the assets are less than $60,000 each. We don’t want those. Why? It will cost more to foreclose than the property is worth. And the banks know this. <br><br>From the Retail Side: There are rehabbers and investors who buy these things. On an individual basis, they know these areas well. There are 2 Intermediaries who have gone off on their own who specialize on these “smaller balance” (aka junker, war zone properties). What they do is they get an option from the bank at a price and then wholesale these off to a *pre-qualified, pre-vetted* buyers list. They run their own trading desk from their basement or office, much like our trading desk sells off assets to institutional buyers. <br>The banks like this because the Intermediary’s value proposition is a) no institution is going to buy these and b) they are special asset that require more attention that no Realtor would touch in a million years. <br><br>(That is a topic for a Continuing Ed or stand-alone system I know everyone wants but I’ve not gotten to yet. I know. There is only so much Sal to go around… But it’s on the list, I promise.)<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Thank You. As noted, I immediately realized the junk in my not so neighboring HOOD&#39;s here in Baltimore and that this was probably a trash tape. I also gathered from you response that you are looking for quality assets in these tapes. <br><br>Only one small question pops in my head about your ideal tape. <br><br>Could you lend a few specifics on the asset values YOU are looking for in these tapes so I can better screen them on my end?<br><br>I also learned that these junk tapes are not where I need to focus....... I will get back to the smaller / community banks that have local assets on their books........ <br><br><br>Allan        </p>

          Allan<br><br>Lucky for you we have AskDandrew Silver which is managed exclusively by Dave Gordon. This is a higher-level membership site that focuses *exclusively* on the Arbitrage business (bulk asset sales; NPLs, RPLs, REOs, S&amp;Ds, fractionals, etc.). <br><br>If you are seeing product *direct* from sellers, than this is a great resource to have. It includes the Pricing Heatmap released 2x a month and a conference call and membership site to Dave Gordon exclusively. The members that have been with Dave love the no-BS methods he works with them and he is actively on the phone with sellers (*not Brokers*) of bulk assets. <br><br>Until Jan 1, the price is $97/month. Go here to learn more: <br>  <br>*https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniett*<br><br>If you are working with brokers and people who aren’t the owners of the assets, do not waste your resources on joining this. Those deals will never close and you&#39;ll just spin your wheels. <br><br>Sal        </p>

(NO GOLF COURSES)<br><br>Golf Course near Washington DC with structures and other assets. have simple word / pdf docs from one of the parties. They need $800K to purchase and property is under contract. Borrowers will put $200-$300K down if required. They are looking for 3 year note, bankruptcy remote entity not a problem and they are planning a major revamp after purchase using their own capital.    <br><br>Allan        </p>

          By model I am asking for a defined set of &quot;bare minimum&quot; park parameters you are using to grade any particular park deal. I get the 5 data points and that it needs to make sense, but over and above that is there a minimum park size (number of units) any minimum dollar value ($1MM &amp; up) , do you want park owned units / or just lot rent parks or a combo of the two. Just a basic footprint of the key ingredients you like.<br><br>My last question on this,is Dandrew positioned to buy and flip/hold them or we the intermediaries, connect buyers with capital?<br><br>Allan          </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>A client contacted me regarding mixed use commercial property. Borrower is gun shy as he has been ripped off on due diligence and then a no go.

The only deal info he would release are the following.<br><br>Location: In Miami Shores, Florida<br>Property type: Mixed use commercial (strip mall / shopping / office) Pastor will convert partially for religious purpose with remaining as tenant leased<br>Recent Appraisal Value: 2.9MM<br>Loan Amount: 1.8MM (62% based upon unseen appraisal)<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Current NOI: $0<br>Target NOI: ? minimum stated was $15,700 monthly (will provide additional after executed non circumvent)<br>Debt stack: 650K 1st <br>S&amp;U: Payoff first, added value to property with remaining capital<br>Exit: Traditional refi exit after improvement<br>________________________________________________________<br>Notes: I am only submitting this based upon strong sponsor equity (almost 78%) if appraisal is accurate. Other collateral in the amount of 200K-300K if needed. I am under the impression that the sponsor might take less than 1.8MM and maybe accept $1.4MM.<br><br>Unable to get more detail w/o bilateral non circumvent.<br><br>Could this be a go or a no go and if it is a possible go will you possibly need the extra collateral?

          Sal, I hope I&#39;m not driving you crazy with repetitive posts. This forum does not give me a clue that the post was actually sent (unlike the other that provide a sent message). Anyway, I sent the following reply I think:<br><br>Hi Sal,<br><br>In a nutshell I was really about to decline on being able to help this client due to the NOI &amp; TARGET NOI (non performing asset) but then I remembered that little Sal in my head that said mall gone dark &amp; I mentally added strip mall gone dark (Tier 1 location) and  I immediately recognized the strong equity.

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I am doing an extra push up here as I am not sure if the following was submitted......<br><br>A client contacted me regarding a sponsor who claims to have been ripped off on due diligence fees and he is now gun shy as a result. My contact person is not the borrower nor is he under any contract with the borrower, in fact, he is trying to wedge himself into a piece of the pie on my side of the table. I am evaluating his cut and how I can further recover his cut by a possible point spread and or hope cert. <br><br>______________________________________________<br>Property Type: Mixed use commercial (minimal details, strip mall / office / retail) owned by a pastor who wants to convert partially for religious use and the remaining as tenant leased<br>Recent Appraisal: 2.9MM (verbal)<br>Projected ARV/ADV: 4MM plus<br>Loan Amount: 1.8MM<br>______________________________________________<br>Current NOI: $0<br>Target NOI: minimum of $15,700 monthly stated (additional target NOI info provided after executed non circumvent)<br>Debt Stack: $650k 1st<br>S&amp;U:  payoff first, value added improvement with remaining loan proceeds<br>Exit: Traditional refi upon completion of improvements<br><br>Uncertain of sponsors ability to undertake this project. More info to follow if it looks we can get past GO.<br>______________________________________________<br><br>NOTES: I am only submitting this question based upon the sponsors strong equity (currently 77.5% if appraisal is accurate). He has other collateral that may be pledged as such. I am also getting a mixed signal that the sponsor may accept a lower amount. Current LTV is 62% if appraisal is accurate. Additional collateral is estimated between 200-300K, a possible 15 plus % additional skin if the values are correct. <br><br>At a glance is this a possible go or no go. If go, will you require the additional collateral. I am also understanding that a 50% LTV might be acceptable. As noted above, I would like to wedge myself in on an added point on the loan and possibly a hope cert to offset middleman.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Allan           </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>A few simple questions regarding REO vs &quot;in the process of becoming REO&quot;<br><br>(Is there an Intermediary opportunity when it relates to searching out commercial assets in foreclosure but not actually REO?) <br><br>More directly stated............<br><br>Will Dandrew entertain buying a note when legal has been filed but the asset is not actually REO at that snapshot in time. I ask this because there could still be liens in place while in the process of foreclosure and there could still be a risk of the Debtor tossing it into BK.<br><br>And, if your answer yes, will note holders typically hold out for the foreclosure sale to occur (look at foreclosure sale bids) or are they generally open to dialogue?<br><br><br>Allan<br>        </p>

          Allan<br><br>Absolutely. This happens all day long. <br><br>Remember this infographic? <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=312<br><br>Remember, the risk is highest closest to the foreclosure date as the sponsor can file BK literally moments before. I&#39;ve seen it happen. <br><br>But if we know who we&#39;re working with, we can mitigate this risk. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I am friends with a local hard money lender who took a very hard hit in the residential crash from 2008 forward. At one point he had over 200 REO&#39;s. What remains today are junk unattractive REO assets and he is somewhat rigid in the sense of buying any other residential properties, however, he is lending but his lending terms are now tighter (more skin in the game) but I want to introduce him to the concepts Dandrew offers........<br><br>What can I offer to him and of course keep myself in the dividend, distribution, consulting reward loop both short and long term?           </p>

          Allan<br><br>Thanks for this. Let me tell you that this is a story I’ve seen many, many, many times.  Let me answer this the way I think this reads to the more sophisticated finance guys.<br><br>Your friend here basically screwed up his portfolio, thought trees would grow to the sky, and made bets with other people’s money to lend on undesirable assets with no borrower skin in the game? The Great Crash of 2008 was 6 freaking years ago, and he *still* has assets on his books? Is the “Crash of 2008” his proverbial “Get Out Of Jail Free Card?” Let me further guess he was a mortgage broker? Realtor? <br><br>Why do you think he wants to talk to me? What value are you trying to achieve here? To be certain, *I’m not criticizing you, I’m criticizing him* and his naiveness. But I want to know what you’re thinking so I can lead you in the right direction other than tell you to *give this guy a copy of my book as a stocking stuffer and telling him never to take a red cent of anyone else’s money again - ever - until he reads it.*<br><br>*http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1599325047/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1599325047&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=askdan-20&amp;linkId=E575QP34ZNONEZ3U*<br><br>(Editor’s Note: Sal is very cranky today due to End of Year accounting and other stuff he has to do. But as AJ says, this is when the really good stuff comes out, and I never said I was Tony Robbins…)<br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Brutal..... lighten up on the caffeine. My hard money lender knows nothing about Dandrew or even your existence, nor would I even be Flakey enough to even talk to you about his worse than distressed portfolio. My message to you needs some clarity, My hard money source is as I understand it stable in this predicament, however, he rarely buys any properties now and his lending terms are now as strict as yours (Skin in the game 101 learned). Also understand that these now junk loans that are dead on his books were created in the falsely inflated market just before the crash. <br><br>Because he is not anywhere near as active as he once was (and he was top dig in this area and still is) I had an idea NOT HIM, to try and warm him up to your school of thoughts. As of this moment I have not spoken to him and he has no idea that you even exist. <br><br>My thoughts ran amuck as follows. I want to approach him and discuss bringing some capital into Dandrew&#39;s school of thought and simultaneously therewith, wedge myself into the payout loop (Intermediary). Having said that I am seeking your advice on how to educate him on what products you have ,that include me, the approach you would use to persuade him to invest some of his capital in one or more Dandrew gateways, but , at the same time I am not just a good samaritan.              </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I meant to add the following. The reason he has these left overs on his books is because they are all junk, now encumbered by tax lien, code enforcement issues etc... and none are worth recovering....... and in each case it would be more wasted capital where no chance of profit exists. The safe assets that he took back were resold by him under his current lending terms, Answering another point you make, he has never been a realtor or agent, in fact, he is retired from the medical profession and other than his enormous line of credit (with a big name bank) he used only his money and the line of credit to make these and many good loans. As you can very well understand, anyone getting 10% - 15% on a performing note would not willing to part with those notes. I was floored when I looked at his REO spreadsheet (4-6MM) and that&#39;s when I realized how hard of a hit he took and it further floored me to see that he could absorb the hit and still be in the business today.        </p>

          Allan, <br><br>Doctors and money go together like oil and water. And one thing doctors all have, is a large signature line of credit. All of them. So yes, he will be a perfect candidate for the NNN fund as I mentioned in another answer to one of your posts. <br><br>Sal        </p>

Although I have been a linkedin member for several years, I flew under the radar for legal reasons that gave me my very own country music song due to our wonderful financial collapse.
