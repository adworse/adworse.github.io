          Al, in my humble opinion, the only possible explanation is that the Sponsor must have been AAA rated and provided extraordinary collateral !!!!..... I would also suggest that your Banker be telling you one side of the equation....plus the fact that it doesn&#39;t make a bit of sense from a HM perspective.        </p>

          Sal, you said there are no stupid questions so help me out here. The buy price is $ 2.6mm with an underlying Bank loan of $ 1.7mm secured with a 1st T.D. leaving a net equity position of $900,000. The seller agreed to carry back his $900,000 equity as a 2nd T.D. which you structured at 6.38%, I/O with a monthly payment of $ 4,780. I am confused as to why we would pay the seller an additional $520,000 in cash from our sell side transaction? (unless the 2nd T.D. of $900,000 was subject to a cash payment of $520,000 within (x) term leaving a balance of $380,000). ((I may have missed a section of the video as I&#39;m in Nigeria training pilots how to fly Gulfstream corporate jets and the internet here runs at dial-up modem speed when available))<br><br>Additionally, since the total monthly payments on the above debt stack of $1.7mm + $ 0.9mm =  $ 12,406 per month ($7,621 and  $ 4,780), would it be possible to sell this property using a wrap of the entire $2.6 mm with a new sale price of $3.0mm. I would market this sale as Mobile Home Park with &quot;huge upside potential, &quot;NO BANK QUALIFYING&quot; with terms of a minimum 20% cash down and using an Investment Land Contract to retain the new T.D. The monthly payment to us on a new (all inclusive) T.D. @ 6.75% /20yrs /5 year balloon would be $ 19,769/mo leaving a (???) cash flow of $7,363/mo or $ 88,356/annually. That would be $600,000 in down payment cash on the front side and $441,780 over the 60 month balloon period for a $1,041,780 profit.<br><br>The video Modules are &quot;priceless&quot; in terms of quality education and I will  be implementing a huge marketing plan in conjunction with my website and Intelligent Office setup next month. I have already started calling the Bank&#39;s asset managers per your FDIC guidelines resulting in three OREO &quot;tapes&quot; thus far. (nothing of interest at all)        </p>

          Private Equiteer Ronald: <br><br>You got that right: The 2nd T.D. of $900,000 was subject to a cash payment of $520,000 within (x) term leaving a balance of $380,000. There is no such thing as overleveraging a real estate deal. I don’t know who teaches this, but it’s not us! <br><br>And yes, you can sell this property doing a wrap. You can wrap this more than once; in fact before SPEs became popular after the RTC of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, this was a very common way for deal junkies to do deals. (However, all was forgotten when banks were lending to the toothless and homeless during the last credit cycle.)<br><br>Regarding your no bank qualifying, yes. That is certainly how it would be *marketed*, but you still need to find a buyer with some depth to his pockets. Selling this to a desperate seminar grad wouldn’t be ideal. <br><br>*But you are definitely on the right track and are thinking well about this.* <br><br>AJ and I next month will be doing a continuing ed on structuring these in your Self-Directed IRAs, so stay tuned for that and I hope you get faster internet when you come back… <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal<br><br>PS Did you send these 3 tapes in so far?         </p>

          Thanks for clarifying the numbers and the fact that a wrap is viable. As far as the tapes go, the first two did not get past the &quot;Dandrew Deal Decision Tree&quot;. They did &quot;not fit&quot; my fund managers lending parameters and were not worth the risk to my Reputational Capital (and less than $580K in total). The 3rd Tape received an initial &quot;yes&quot; but after further inquiry did not make it past &quot;if I had the money to lend would I fund this deal personally&quot;.....NO and I have owned and developed both Commercial and Residential properties over the years. The Motel was located in the middle of nowhere and requires very large sums of capital for &quot;compliance repairs&quot;. These were the last two remaining on the Banks OREO book. I have the tape available (small Bank in L.A. sent to me on 10/24) if you insist but the last thing I want to do is waste your team&#39;s valuable time and my reputation.<br>								<br>APN#	Property Address	Vacancy	Collateral Type, Nuber of Units, Commercial or Residential 	Size	Collateral Location		 Original Note Amount 	Current Status<br>					City	State		<br>3421110136, 7	&quot;960 Highway 20<br>Winthrop, WA  98862&quot;	Occupied	63 unit Hotel/Motel	21,734 sqft	Winthrop	WA	 $2,000,000.00 	Compliance repairs pending<br>63304-08-006	&quot;3842 N.

          Robert: <br><br>Here&#39;s what I would tell you to do: *Do Not Send Out Flyers To Commercial Property Owners*. <br><br>I know you don&#39;t want to hear that. But let me tell you why: <br><br>1. Many landlords in commercial use management companies as their proxy to look for solutions (capital, accounting, etc.). <br>Therefore, use the Pyramid of Priority that was given to (all) of you when you joined one of our programs. <br><br>2. If someone is in problems financially, they will go to their lawyers. <br>Again, use the Pyramid of Priority coupled with the LinkedIn Leaders. <br><br>3. Mailing campaigns are very costly and yield little results. I would venture to say a majority of our deals come from Intermediaries using LinkedIn Leaders. <br><br>As an aside - and don&#39;t ask me when - the new credibility kit will allow you to place banner ads and skyscrapers to your credibility kit so you&#39;re marketing is that much more targeted and you immediately get an ROI. <br><br>This is taking a lot of my time to put together, but it will be money well spent rather than sending mailings that may not be seen. <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Robert, here is our experience with a Direct Mail campaign conducted last year. We had our printer produce 5,000 pieces of the 4x6 postcard selected from the credibility kit media. We also purchased a list of names of Commercial property owners with specifications such as property type, value, etc. We had the envelopes printed with each name and address in place of using mailing labels. After spending over $6,000 on this campaign we received the following number of leads; -0- as in not one phone call response to our on call receptionist. Sal is absolutely 100% spot-on!        </p>

          Ron, thanks for your feedback, I really appreciate it.  I have been thinking of various ways to keep my marketing going strong, especially since I have not had many LinkedIn Group inquiries accepted.  I am hoping that in due time I will be able to join more Groups.  Being at the mercy of Group administrators as far as being accepted, I feel this is going to take longer that I anticipated.  Best to you in your business!        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Great call yesterday with you and A.J. Thanks. Wanted to let you know what is hapenning with me. Still calling banks- took a few days off but hitting it hard again Monday. Anyway- short side of it.<br>Had a guy I was talking to- he asked me what the deal was - if I was the end buyer for a pool. I said no- but I am direct with fund- and my job is to underwrite tape( srubb it up) then if it qualifies- I send it off to the fund manager.<br>He then said that he wanted a NDA signed from you guys. I said they will not  that- so I moved on. Just frustrating is all. Banks are my best bet of course. Just wanted to share it so others could see as well. I am not going to send you over anything of no value or waste my time chasing a deal that has no chance of closing. Thanks!        </p>

          It&#39;s not clear in your statement if the guy you were speaking with was a banker. If you sign an NDA with a banker who releases a tape or pool of assets to you, it would be good protocol to inform the banker that you would like to send the list to your capital provider. In that case would he (banker) like to have your capital provider also sign a NDA ? <br>Trying to speak directly to bank asset managers is a frustrating exercise 99% of the time. After being placed on hold you will then be directed to a voice mail. This is by design when you consider how many calls come into a bank looking for this same person. I concentrate on leaving a very professional and to the point message of who I am and what I am looking for. My company name, website URL and my specific interest (NPL&#39;s listed in &quot;non-accrual status&quot; in the banks last quarterly CALL sheet. I then direct them to my &quot;Intelligent Office&quot; phone number and not my cell-phone. I want the banker to call my New York exchange and have my &quot;receptionist&quot; direct his call. This reinforces my credibility along with having a professional website presentation. Since I started this procedure I have had four banks return my call. In two cases, when the receptionist called stating that Mr X from XYZ Bank was on the phone, I was not in an appropriate setting (a loud Pub) to take his call and directed her to state that I was in a meeting. In three cases the asset manager stated that they were not selling but added &quot;at this time&quot; , which is his way of saying &quot; but I can see you are capable of clearing any balance sheet assets when I do need to sell something. The last banker had already liquidated his REO between the 12/31/2013 balance sheet date and the end of March. Keep calling and sooner or later your services will be appreciated.          </p>

          Sal,<br>This article was published by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Tuesday. It seems that bankers are making loans to Commercial and Multifamily to the tune of $358 Billion in 2013. This seems like a significant increase in lending  which would suggest that lenders have relaxed their underwriting requirements.......or is this just a small percentage of market share going to the crem-de-la-crem sponsor ?<br><br>(Article from front page of the MBA website)<br><br>WASHINGTON, DC (April 8, 2014) – Commercial and multifamily mortgage bankers closed $358.5 billion of loans in 2013 according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) 2013 Commercial Real Estate/Multifamily Finance Annual Origination Volume Summation.<br><br>Commercial bank and savings institutions were the leading investor group for whom loans were originated in 2013, responsible for $100.5 billion of the total.  CMBS issuers saw the second highest volume, $79.8 billion, and were followed by life insurance companies and pension funds; Fannie Mae; REITS, mortgage REITS and investment funds; and Freddie Mac.<br><br>In terms of property types, multifamily properties saw the highest origination volume, $136.9 billion, followed by office buildings, retail properties, hotel/motel, industrial, and health care.  First liens accounted for 97 percent of the total dollar volume closed.<br><br>“Improving property markets and a strong appetite among lenders led to a very active year in commercial real estate finance,” said Jamie Woodwell, MBA’s Vice President of Commercial Real Estate Research.  “Multifamily rental properties drew the most financing, and banks and thrifts were the largest source of commercial real estate lending.  Despite the fact there are fewer maturing loans in need of refinancing this year, originations should continue to be buoyed by higher property values, rising property incomes and still low interest rates.”<br><br>Driven in part by increased coverage, the reported dollar volume of commercial and multifamily mortgages closed in 2013 was 47 percent higher than the volume reported in 2012.  Among repeat participants in the survey, the dollar volume of closed loans rose by 22 percent.         </p>

          Ron<br><br>This is the equivalent of the NAR saying that housing is going to go up, up, and up to the heavens. <br><br>These banks are lending on prime assets in Class A cities. Office complexes in NYC. Deals most intermediaries won&#39;t see due to their size. <br><br>Not the smaller balance stuff that we invest / lend on. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Gentlemen,I would like clarification with respect to the POF letter recently received. I am aware that this privilege has been subject to fraud in the past and just want to insure I am staying within your guidelines.I have located a block of REO properties through a Realtor employed with a National Real Estate firm. He handles REO sales for a Bank and responded to our direct mail marketing. In addition, he has represented that he can arrange a direct meeting with the Lender&#39;s Asset Manager and myself to discuss special pricing for 38 SFH. He indicates that the properties have been foreclosed within the last 4-6 weeks. Apparently the Lender wants to liquidate all 38 homes at an attractive discount for cash to avoid processing them as REO&#39;s.He will only set up the meeting if I am able to show him financial responsibility. In this case am I permitted to provide a copy of my POF letter to his office? Thanks Sal and Best wishes to you and the Dandrew Team.        </p>

          Ron<br><br>Great question. Yes, we unfortunately have had to scorch the earth with folks who have abused this privilege for many reasons, including: <br><br>1.  Protect the brand so Intermediaries can benefit. <br><br>2.  Protect the Intermediaries’ investment in our training that they paid for. <br><br>I will tell you you’re on to something here, however, you should only – for this deal only – leverage the POF to get to the seller. In this case, it’s the Asset Manager. Then say this to him in bold, copy and paste: <br><br>*I’m only qualified up to $___ MM however, my capital provider would be interested in looking at this tape as it may exceed my current capital limitations or be outside of my geographic axe. Would you care if I showed it to my LPs in NYC?*<br><br>[THEN SHUT UP.] <br><br>It only works ever time. <br><br>Let me know if it works for you. <br><br>Sal        </p>
