          Stan: <br>We talk about those in the videos at length.<br><br>We also talk about how *where* to *submit deals* to vs. *where to submit help desk requests to*. <br><br>If you read the AskDandrew Owners’ Manual and Quick Start Guide, you would have known this early on like all other newer Intermediaries and perhaps you wouldn’t have sent so many help desk requests that you should have placed here - from multiple email addresses. That alone has cost us hours in Customer Support for you that could have easily been avoided if you had read the AskDandrew Owners’ Manual. And yes, we see that was sent to you but it wasn’t opened.  But because you canceled your first subscription, the staff had to find you using another one of your email address. <br><br>I’m willing to bet that you’ve not watched more than the first video on the Arbitrager course even though AJ tells me you logged in only 3 times. <br><br>So let me answer your questions:<br><br>1.  Dandrew investing parameters are on the videos. Min pool size $2mm. Min asset size 50K. Nothing will be bought under 50K, they will be carved out. There are many exceptions of course. <br><br>2.  Pricing expectations. If you watched the videos and read the Arbitrager Manual, you will know that the *seller* has to give pricing expectations. We don’t. That is the same as going to a drive-thru window and the teller tells *you* what you’re going to eat. Doesn’t work that way. <br><br>3.  Fee Agreement. We don’t offer fee agreements until *after* we have seen a tape from someone and have provided a final bid. Again, you can view these on the videos. <br><br>*Frankly Stan, I fail to understand how you think you will be successful in this business if you don’t follow simple instructions instead of complaining to the help desk?*<br><br>We put a ton of time, effort and money setting these systems up for *you*. And you are basically just saying to us, “screw you, I’ll do what I want and I’m not going to follow directions and I expect to be successful.”<br>The help desk is not the deal desk. And the deal desk isn’t the help desk. <br><br>Someone making an hourly wage isn’t qualified to look at your deals. They only deal with customer support issues. And someone in NYC who looks at deals could care less about your customer support issues. They only work on deals and with folks who can follow directions. We know there is a learning curve, but blatantly not following the Owner’s Manual is not excusable under any circumstances. <br><br>*So until you have watched the videos, and read through your AskDandrew Owner’s Manual, don’t submit any deals.* If you have any questions about access to systems, don’t ask them here. I can’t help you. That is what the help desk is for. <br><br>We’ve purposely have made this easy for anyone to succeed with a little effort, except of course if they don’t follow directions.  We only want to work with the grownups. I said this multiple times on all AskDandrew Capital Calls and webinars when you purchased this. There is nothing here that you’ve not been told already. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Dear Sal:<br>Thank you for your reply and the time spent . Yes you have a quality organization but your system is complicated.<br>Actually I was under the impression that a fee agreement would be in place before I bring deals to Dandrew. I feel I have been mislead. I do not know of any intermediaries that will work without some fee agreement in place.<br><br>Regards,<br>Stan Ahrens.        </p>

          That is not accurate Stan. Where did you hear me say we hand out fee agreements? Tell specifically how you were &quot;mislead&quot;. <br><br>Why would we want to obligate ourselves into any fee agreement if we haven&#39;t even seen a deal. Did you commit to marrying your spouse by meeting her at the altar for the first time? <br> <br>We don&#39;t do this. We won&#39;t do this.        </p>
