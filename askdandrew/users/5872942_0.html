          Hi Sal,<br>I have a doctor who came to me for some insight on a deal he is trying to put together, and I was hoping to get some insight from you to pass along, at the least. <br><br>In short, he wants to buy municipal bonds and trade them to smaller banks in exchange for their non performing notes. The goal is to acquire these assets at a lower cost than cash, while bringing the bank&#39;s balance sheet back in the black. It goes much more in depth, but I don&#39;t want to write a novel. We have an attorney looking into it, and from what she&#39;s come up with, there is no current legislation preventing this type of transaction, we would just have to have all of the players set up before we do it. <br><br>This doctor has Saudi contacts who are ready to write a check for the bonds. My questions to you are these:<br><br>1. I have watched all of the videos regarding valuation of these notes, but I still don&#39;t have a clear understanding of how to determine the actual value or pricing expectations of these notes, or how to work with them in bulk as far as finding out about bankruptcies, etc. Can you point me to the right training if I have it, or tell me what I need to get if I don&#39;t? Any advice in this area is also appreciated.<br><br>2. Is there any insight you could offer me in regards to this plan itself?<br><br>3. If this idea turns into reality, is there anywhere Dandrew might fit into a transaction like this?<br><br>I know I haven&#39;t explained it very well, but I am trying to be brief. If you have any questions, I will get the answers back to you shortly.<br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Steve        </p>
      </span>

          Steve<br><br>This is not something I would want to get involved with. In short, it doesn’t make sense, a bank selling a non-performing loan using municipal bonds? The Saudi investors add a level of complexity and are a huge red flag. <br><br>How did you find this deal? It sounds like the run of the mill BS that comes in from Craigslist. <br><br>Please just focus on things that will get you paid. Not this crap. *Doctors + Middle Eastern Investors + Weird Deal Structures = Trouble*.<br><br>Sal<br><br>        </p>

          I just submitted a deal that a friend of mine is looking to fund. It&#39;s a hotel in Florida, but the numbers are lower than what you work with. It&#39;s solid. I had read in one of these forums that you have other capital sources who deal with projects under $2m. I&#39;m hoping to get my first commercial deal done through you or one of your affiliates, and I just wanted to confirm that I&#39;m going through the right channels, rather than have the deal refused for being too low.<br><br>Thanks        </p>

          Sal, <br>I know that you don&#39;t like new construction and I know that you don&#39;t like senior care facilities either. Do you know anybody that might be interested in funding (debt and equity) a very experienced team that is seeking funding for the purpose of developing the first three of a planned ten 50-unit senior care facilities in the coastal southeastern United States.        </p>

          I may have a quality connect for you as well, if you are still involved with the senior housing. <br><br>I have a friend who likes to partner on new residential construction under $500k per unit, up to $10m per subdivision/condo. He does participation mortgages backed by 1st position liens, occasionally 2nd&#39;s as well, but he is strictly residential. <br><br>This particular person has the ability to go higher with his project costs, but he says a bunch of smaller deals never ruined anyone, opposed to large egg baskets. Very interesting gentleman who has made and lost millions twice in his life, and he also emerged victorious from a very expensive legal tangle with the FDIC. He recommends steering clear of the latter.<br><br>Anyway, shoot me a quick reply if you have some possible deal making opportunities in the residential realm, or smaller commercial that is outside of Dandrew&#39;s deal focus and/or price range. I&#39;m new to commercial, horrible at managing contractors, and if I never buy another fix &amp; flip in my life, I would die a happy man.  <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>That was directed to Billy, I was just inquiring on his post, because it seems likely that deals can be done outside of your criteria with our personal networks. Not my focus either. <br><br>My focus is to iron out a somewhat boilerplate system to raise capital for a few select qualified operators around the country who currently operate successful residential redevelopment companies in the $1m range of inventory. I&#39;d like to utilize the network I have to get myself a nice cushy streamlined niche. Each may have various differences, but the main idea is to allow the company to step up into a higher project cost bracket, and possibly utilize some creative exit strategies, such as lease options and building quality turn key rental portfolios to liquidate after a certain amount of time. <br><br>I&#39;ve already put a lot of time into figuring this out, and your course has really helped put the puzzle peices together for me. I wish I had it sooner, but there&#39;s still opportunities everywhere. I think I&#39;ll be going to Texas soon as well. <br><br>Sal, thanks for the response, and I look forward to chatting with you in the weeks ahead. Enjoy your day.        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I have been hired/partnered with a residential redevelopment company to take over the capital raising side of the business. The operator is qualified and just wants to focus his attention on the construction side, which is his specialty. His wife is an accountant, so she does that. He offered me 5% of the amount that I bring in, which is more than I thought was standard, but that&#39;s not important. I already have a wealthy trust deed investor for singe acquisitions, but I want to structure some kind of LP or fund to allow the company liquid capital to deploy immediately when a deal comes in. Once I set this up, I already have a few other companies who are waiting to work with me, and I have not done any marketing yet, so I have an interesting opportunity to integrate myself into many successful operations nationwide. This alone will expand my network, create massive credibility, and bring in countless opportunities to establish my career as a capital provider in not only residential, but across the board.<br><br>In one of the videos, you offered to show the students a residential pitch book you had done awhile back. Could I see that as well? Are there any other interesting materials or contacts that I can access to help me set this up? Thanks Sal!<br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br>Steve        </p>

          Steve<br><br>This is great. Did they give you a retainer? Are you doing the pitch book for free? What did they give you already? <br><br>What are they doing specifically? What is &quot;residential redevelopment&quot;? To me that means many different things. <br><br>Also, if you are *Private Equiteer*, there are a lot of pitch books available there in the *Fundraising Fundamentals*. <br><br>Keep in mind you&#39;re going to have to pay someone to put together your deck and if you&#39;re going dry, you&#39;ll have to come out of pocket for this. What kind of arrangement was this?<br><br>If you&#39;re acting as a Placement Agent, that is much, much different than just brokering capital. <br><br>*And you better have a signed agreement with them for the 5% otherwise I&#39;ll fly Matt there to Pitts to spank you silly.*<br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br><br>The profanity-free version of what I was thinking when I read &quot;Are you doing the pitch book for free?&quot; is no.<br><br>Keep in mind, this was all done before I became a private equiteer, so there will be some changes moving forward.<br><br>My retainer fee was $2,500. At least half would be paid up front, the rest upon delivery of the documents which included a business plan, PPM, etc. All expenses including legal, marketing travel (if necessary), etc. were separate from the fee. In this case, $2,000 was paid (which is what I used to purchase the private equiteer program). <br><br>Services included guiding the client through acquiring the documents and then finding investors for them to present their project to. No guarantees, funding was solely dependent on the investor&#39;s acceptance of the client&#39;s presentation and docs. <br><br>I have already made business plans for some of my own ideas, so I planned to do those myself, and that was the only product included in the retainer fee. The rest depended on their wallet, and would come straight from it to the law firm, etc. <br><br>Now, I have set up a meeting with this client to see if they want to go with the original arrangement or pay a few thousand more to do it this way. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m going to be doing it like the big boys as a private equiteer, so I&#39;m basically getting paid to learn your secrets. I love it!<br><br>Hit me with the real questions now, please.<br><br>Steve<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Regarding the residential redevelopment question, you can see a successful company who&#39;s business model is nearly identical to a majority of rehabbers in my personal network at revamprealty.com. I had actually started my quest for knowledge nearly 2 years ago when I flew to PA from CA to funnel my first private lender&#39;s funds into Jenna&#39;s growing company. I ended up buying my first property from her and then moved into the city to do my own thing, and she followed the Fortune Builder&#39;s Mastery Training program to a T, even landed a speaking spot at Ignite in Vegas next month. Anyway, I have made connections and build solid friendships with many people in and out of the Fortune Builder&#39;s network. I never really progressed with the training, as I was dedicated to becoming the money man for other people&#39;s ventures, but I highly respect the program and I know exactly what a qualified operator in the residential redevelopment realm looks like from being a part of that program. I think that more than answered your question, and I am excited to be here. I feel like I am near the end of the starving student phase and I can see the beginning of a lifelong career right around the corner, doing exactly what I want to be doing. Not many people can say that, and I feel pretty good about it.         </p>

          Sal, <br><br>No, the $2,500 was for me. The other costs are aside from that. I made it clear that the total cost could be $10k to $15k. I know of places who charge $25k just for the PPM, and I&#39;ve heard of other people who use the same one over and over I know that&#39;s not a good move for different ventures, but what if it was for the same business model, just different sponsors? I&#39;m not looking to raise more than $5M per client right now, and the idea was to set up a system where I could just gain experience with something I know and build my own list of active investors for my deals using these small capital raises with identical business models until I had personal relationships with enough investors to be able to move on to something bigger when the opportunity presented itself.<br><br>I understand a quality pitchbook will probably run around $1k, the cost of the PPM  varies, but I saw something about your lawyer only charging $2k? I also read another post that mentioned the total cost to his client would be around $12k ($10k retainer + $2k PPM). Once I get quality marketing materials, couldn&#39;t I just use them with some minor edits for other companies, since the nuts and bolts of a fix &amp; flip business is pretty much standard? If the PPM is only $2k, then that&#39;s not an issue at all. <br><br>I&#39;m basically just asking for general advice or things to pay extra attention to, or maybe little things that I can do to streamline the process so I can have a few smaller sized projects going around the country at any given time, while making residual and repeat income from clients during the term of their raise, which was initially one year. Based on the buying criteria, they would be able to pay 10%-12% annual interest with quarterly payments and 15%-30% of their annual net profit. As long as they used the money at least once, they would be able to at least cover the interest with a small amount to the investor at the end. In reality, these people can turn the money over at least 2 or 3 times. Now that I&#39;m learning different ways to structure the return, I am a little confused as to the optimal way to set this up. I&#39;m sure I will figure it all out eventually, but I&#39;d like to go to my current client with this today so I don&#39;t have to keep modifying the plan. I know my original structure might have been close, but not as professional as it should be.<br><br>I know you&#39;re a very busy man, so I&#39;ll stop here. The more I learn, the more questions I have, and I am more of an interactive learner, so I&#39;m hoping to find a more experienced private equiteer to bounce ideas around rather than write novels to you here. <br><br>Thanks Sal,<br><br>Steve<br><br>        </p>
