          Hi Sal,<br><br>Referencing your mention today re: deal diligence. I realize that every deal that you work through takes 25-50K to paper it. As I&#39;d described, I&#39;m working on equity funding a project that has a high upside and will add in and increase multiple profit centers on an existing profitable operation. You asked whether its a land or business deal.<br> More specific answer: <br><br>       Note on land:               $1.5MM down, carry back the rest ( $2.4MM of total $3.9MM) by long-time owner<br>       Operational Funding: $700K for construction of infrastructue and mktg to ramp up added and existing operations<br><br>Where/how does one best research and divulge the reputation and integrity and thus risk assessment of a given sponsor/principal. Is it mostly a Private Eye type of engagement beyond the appraisal? If so, any recommendations? I know you&#39;ve mentioned previously the high dollar service you subscribe to giving you the God&#39;s Eye view, I&#39;m working towards such a perspective Sal. In the interim, what are stop gap options beyond the walk away? And yes, I am nibbling at some possibly potent items in the four food groups too...<br><br>Yes, i can handle the 2x4 treatment but anything additional would be greatly appreciated sir! Thank you Sal.<br><br>Best,<br>Eric        </p>

          Google Private Background Checks. They cost about $500. There could be cheaper ones. But if you&#39;re not willing to pay $500 to protect your reputation then you probably are in the wrong business.         </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>Thank you for your insights from earlier today on the call. I will post separately in respect to your reference to deal diligence...<br><br>Here I wanted to continue with the topic of LinkedIN Leaders Bandwidth Boosting! I would appreciate locating and/or receiving: <br><br>- a concise, jargon rich description of the parameters I operate with as a Dandrew Intermediary and private discretionary financier <br><br>whilst learning alongside your bountiful brainpower (and yes sir, I am) Sal et al.<br><br>Also, is it best to include a logo on my profile and a direct link to my website (through credibility kit webhosting corp.) Such is my assumption. Yet often such a thing can be profanity. Let me know what further catalyst(s) I can offer that will attend your specificity requests!  As ever, I am grateful and in awe of your tutelage, expertise and professionalism sir.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Eric        </p>

          Happy Weekend Sal,<br><br>I am seeking to find a short body of text that you made available sometime ago to Linked IN Leaders. I purchased the product many months ago and am now upgrading in earnest my online image including my Linked In profile! <br><br>I read the text that Sal wrote up for us to paste onto our page. It was a few short paragraphs of acronyms and lingo-heavy language that succinctly described what our scope of focus is as private discretionary financiers! <br><br>I have looked through the material on the Linked in leaders dashboard and don&#39;t see it there. As I recall I saw it sent as email from Sal, which I can not locate in my search. I would appreciate your help in tracking down this superb leverage tool as I co-create a stellar empire with you fine folks... :-)<br><br>Best,<br>Eric        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>If it helps you for reference, the part of last Friday&#39;s Conf. Call that you referred to the link was at 51:50 mins into the call. You first called it &quot;Product Offering&quot; and then right after &quot;Structured Product Offering&quot;. I had asked if there was a sliding scale for determining whether, and if so, how much a mezz piece would factor into a cap stack in funding any interesting potential deal on top of a First Trust Deed. Best always to you,<br><br>Eric        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>Please explain a little further your inquiry today about what kind of money this client may have? Do you mean cash and liquidity or more about how much they have to make some plays with now? Also, as to what they don&#39;t like, is this discerning the asset classes they won&#39;t invest in or more so short or long play strategy. <br>They are open to both short and long plays depending on the deal. They are actively visiting/evaluating properties now...<br><br>Also, is there a document available to me here that effectively delineates the responsibilities and distribution of commissions for me an intermediary and a RE (resi) agent who&#39;s referring these clients to me? The agent is touring with one partner to show properties now... <br><br>Eric        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>A client is looking to make some initial plays in the US. They are Canadian and experienced w/ a portfolio there. They want to know the best vehicle/entity to invest through here. Do you recommend LLC or C Corp. or even S Corp or a combination of these that would be wholly owned by their parent corp in Canada?<br><br>Also they are wondering which strategy they should use to begin with. They&#39;re focused on multifamily, self storage and small strip retail. They and I are seeking to build a long term relationship here.They are asking me about non-recourse or portfolio loans... What direction would you offer?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Eric        </p>

          Hi Sal, I really appreciate your fine insights. Not sure if my questions went through yesterday. Here a few quick ones:<br>1. Best title for an intermediary currently?<br>2. Is it kosher to include a letter sequence or word in the business phone number(s)? Ex: (800) CAP-3332 (227-3332) is something like this is appropriate or not?<br>3. would a green color scheme in place of the red for card and storefront be viable?<br>4. is support@... the best email to list on the card... should we list it on the site or not there at all? What is best practice?<br>Cheers        </p>

          This got lost in the queue. Sorry for answering so late. You can thank AJ later… anyway answers to your questions are imbedded below: <br><br>1. I would say *Structured Product Sales.* <br>The newbies are doing well with this one as they don’t risk credibility out of the gate if they don’t know the answer to something. <br><br>For example: someone could say to you “you don’t know if you do preferred equity? I thought you’re the Owner/CEO!?” <br><br>This stops you from looking silly…<br><br>2.  Yes. You can do that. Sure! <br><br>3.  No green. Its not a flattering color for finance. Name one financial company that has green that is not a commercial bank like TD Ameritrade…<br><br>4.  Your first initial and last initial “@yourcompanydomain.com”<br><br>Let’s get going! <br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I&#39;ll be as brief yet specific as possible here. I need a letter to use in opening credible, intelligent dialogue with owners of properties that are in various states of build out but typically would be the earliest/earlier stages of development post entitlement or zoning. I&#39;m uncertain whether this initial letter would include description of types of funding i.e. construction loan, etc. that we can offer.<br><br>Certainly the goal would be to convey a credible, competent and interested posture to procure the owner&#39;s cooperation and proceed with further value exchange. Ideally this would be a stout lever with which to stimulate the recipient&#39;s interest in beginning to work out a deal with us. These properties would be in urban and maybe secondary/tertiary banded areas of target markets.<br><br>Could you stylize this letter so that it could work for both a construction loan type deals, and a bit further along our path, to be built type deals too. This might look like an alternative paragraph or so denoting the specific deal structure we can resolve their challenges through... If you find the current state of the market as offering up more of certain types of related deal structures (beyond those above) could/should those be included in this letter as potential solutions we can offer? Let me know if more specificity is needed for a good result...<br><br>I&#39;m excited to get into leverage mode with this tool! I trust your intelligence and creativity Sal. Thank you for your attention here. You truly inspire me!<br><br>Abundance,<br>Eric        </p>

          Eric: <br><br>I just posted something on here for Jack DeWeese that will explain what we’re doing here that you can add to your Private Banker Identity Kit. <br><br>Regarding crafting a letter, I’m not sure if that will be effective. Frankly, when we’ve done that in the past, its been more restrictive than inclusive. <br><br>You want the phone to ring, but you also don’t want to create a reason to *exclude* certain folks from calling. <br><br>I know what you want to do, but I want you to be practical in this approach. <br><br>On the next AskDandrew™ call, ask me why this has failed some students in the past. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br>Great exchange with the callers this morning, super Q and A! I hope that this particular message gets through to you. It seems that my message from earlier didn&#39;t make it to you, which has happened multiple times previously. <br>The property has a handful of parcels with multiple lots in each, zoned C1 and C2. It lies in a downtown redevelopment area and is at a strategic position.<br>I need to lock up the property for at least 90 days, and then bring in sharp, innovative development expertise... Let me know if you need more info to draft a letter.<br>Thank you,<br>Eric        </p>

          Eric<br><br>Thank you for this. <br><br>I don’t know how you’re sending these, however, I need to approve the questions first to weed out the ones that are designed for support. You know, like the ones that say “video doesn’t play”…<br><br>Regarding the parcels, we’re not going to be interested in those for a while. We’re interested in those that have structures on them already. We are maxed out on lots right now and our investors don’t want us taking on anymore of this asset type anymore; meaning lots with no development on them.  <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal, does asking to have the other brokers step aside and receive less than their supposed pre-existing contracts for 1% each make me culpable for being in breech of this contract? The broker next to me I&#39;ve spoken with in several occasions and she has verbally stated that she&#39;d accept down to $100K (instead of her 1% = $300K) if need be. And, she texted me that she&#39;d give the broker referring her $20K from that $100K in such a scenario.<br><br>In our contract it states: &quot;Should agent breech its obligation in the performance of its duties under this Agreement. [Sponsor&#39;s] sole remedy shall be to terminate this agreement.&quot;<br><br>What if negotiations go sideways and the broker(s) and/or the sponsor would now seek to wiggle out of this proven contract with any such claims of me being in breech? Recourse? Please describe in as much detail as possible how you&#39;ve seen/experienced such a scenario play out... And your remedy(s) to neutralize/negate any such attempts...        </p>

          Eric, this is AJ.  Sal is out of the office, so I&#39;m handling your questions today.  Even though he answered your first question, I reviewed it and I&#39;m confident that this is Sal&#39;s answer:<br><br>Eric, did you not understand Sal&#39;s previous message on this about the importance of being direct?  What you&#39;re asking is an exercise in futility.  You&#39;re working with not one, but 2 brokers on a large deal.  <br><br>Our advise is clear and simple.  Don&#39;t spend time on deals where you&#39;re not direct.  You are NOT direct.  Leave it alone.  Put it on ice.  Move on to another deal.  Period.<br><br>Beyond that, since this is a deal where we are not the capital source, all I can do is recommend that you consult whoever you&#39;ve chosen as your legal counsel for this transaction.  You have engaged legal counsel if you expect to close this on your own, right?<br><br>Think smart, and stay away from brokers, Eric, and you will manage this well.  <br><br>Best,<br>-AJ        </p>

          Yes, and thank you AJ for your insight and attention here. I have spoken with legal counsel and they&#39;ve described that my contract is valid and the other 2 brokers are not parties in my contract with the sponsor and are not entitled to any commissions. I had sought to put in writing what I had as a verbal agreement (which I know matters little) with the one who&#39;d referred me. Ignorant I may be about all the factors, I am seeking to do this smartly and within the realms of what you teach and practice.<br><br>With that in mind, could you please explain/describe how I am not -direct- if I have our contract signed, which delineates me as the receiver of commissions to distribute if needed with brokers that I&#39;m working with? I’ve been meeting with the sponsor for several months now. adding value in some key ways; and he recently signed our contract. He has stated multiple times that I’m to bring to him directly, on the phone and/or in person, any and all prospective lenders/investors (principal or their intermediary whom I find.)  I really do want to understand this (what is still for me and maybe other students a real gray area - of direct not direct) so we may stride forward in bigger and bigger wins. Thank you all.<br>        </p>

If it is true, as you say, that your contract allows you to be direct with the seller, then you are indeed direct.  <br><br>The only point of confusion I would have is, if you believe that you are direct as you say, why were you asking yesterday about how to handle brokers, if they are not in between you and the sponsor, keeping you from being direct?<br><br>It seems that your statements are in conflict.<br><br>Either way, if it is as you state here, please proceed, and good luck.

          Sal and AJ, I didn&#39;t expect you to review the signed contract I&#39;ve described. And thank you much for your prompt reply.<br><br>If you have a signed copy of the contract for brokers in our resources section written with the same language as is in that contract (except the Parties names and the $ figures), then would you operate with certainty that you are direct with the sponsor? Would you operate as an agent (as described in said contract) with the certainty that no matter any other signed contracts with other agents for said sponsor, whether you&#39;ve seen or haven&#39;t seen the other contracts, that your protections of your interests in said contract with the sponsor including your compensation and liabilities are rock solid?<br>        </p>

          Sal, In lieu of showing the brokers this agreement (which the sponsor has stated that it must remain confidential) to the other brokers, is there language or a type of inter-broker’s fee agreement that I can access within our system? What is the going rate in the such a loan whether secured or unsecured?        </p>

          More clearly: What is a standard commission pay out (total points) with and without an equity kicker for both a secured and unsecured (no present collateral offered) for a bridge loan of this size? What weighting for said payout is given to whether elements such as: start up yet with proven concepts and agreements (non-binding) made (I&#39;ve viewed them) with high-value-add partners who, per agreement, will seek become part of said startup;  I&#39;ve spoken to the broker who referred me. I will reach out to the other broker. More granularity of how to restructure this agreement to support me successfully bringing in an accepted investor would be most appreciated.         </p>

          Mark, generally speaking, total commissions spread across brokers shouldn&#39;t exceed 1% of the amount funded.  That&#39;s our general rule of thumb to keep brokers from killing deals, as they have a tendency to do.<br><br>Having said that, reading your convoluted questions on this is a bit nauseating, because you&#39;re asking about something that we tell everyone to stay away from:  Broker daisy-chains.<br><br>Therefore, I am at a loss to advise you any further on this.        </p>

          Sal, $30mm bridge loan. I&#39;ve had a sponsor sign the broker&#39;s agreement (unchanged excepting the parties names and the finance terms). Is there a best practice/most effective way to have the 2 brokers I&#39;m told are in front of me re-negotiate their commissions (per the recommended .2 % referral fee)  or have them step aside to eliminate the daisy chain? I am dealing direct with sponsor. Is there language or a type of inter-broker&#39;s fee agreement that I can access within our system? I&#39;ve planned to make the renegotiated commissions (currently 1% to each intermediary) conditional upon &#39;me&#39; bringing &quot;the funder&quot; who closes. Correct? What structure or language works best here?<br><br>Also, is it customary and professional to ask for and receive such broker&#39;s agreements from the sponsor? He says he doesn&#39;t see the need for me to have copies of the these docs? It&#39;s best to verify that &#39;both&#39; these brokers were in the chain as I only knew of the one who referred me until recently. I may need more $ for downstream referrer&#39;s incentives to paper the deal...        </p>

          Have you spoken to the other brokers? If the sponsor is not showing you this, then you should assume he’s going to pay them. <br><br>Now do you understand why we tell you to be direct? <br><br>I think you lock it up for yourself. Just send him your agreement with you.         </p>

          Sal, Would you draft a concise yet thorough description of what my capabilities as an intermediary (and/or investor, broker if kosher?) are on my Linked In profile? It should be as brief as possible while eloquently delineating why I stand out with impressive creative, deductive and deal-making skill sets primed to add value to my prospective sponsors, clients and partners. It must be industry jargon rich and acronym infused in potent fashion. Alluring and tantalizing to viewers to thus enable my standing out from the crowd.<br><br>It will allow viewers to quickly surmise how I will effectively create superb solutions to their pressing or perceived problems. And, it should leave them wanting to connect with me immediately. Please help me tip the scales in my favor sir. Thank you        </p>
