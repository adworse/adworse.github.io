          Thanks Sal for your thorough and deep response. I am always impressed with how you go all out for your students. As for the Name mix up, I often do that when I am tired. But a NASCAR fan I am not. It would have been more in character for me to call him Jim Gordon, the drummer for Eric Clapton (Jim wrote the second half of Layla), George Harrison, Steely Dan, Zappa, and even Alice Cooper amongst so many many others. He had an incredible career. He was ultimately institutionalized for killing his mother as he suffered from schizophrenia. Awesome drummer though.        </p>

          I&#39;m a huge classic rock/classic vinyl fan. So I know who you mean. I have the Super Sessions on 200 gram vinyl. And spend more than is healthy on high-end audio equipment. Thankfully, AJ knows all about vacuum tubes... <br><br>Let me know how the script goes over with your investors. I&#39;m interested hear how it works for you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal<br>On my way out of the HML workshop we discussed your suggestion that I start a fund. We also discussed the poor state of economics here in New Mexico so I have been looking at Texas but may be stuck here for a few more years. I have since positioned myself to have access to High Net Worth Individuals in Santa Fe, but I am not confident about available plays within the state as you said my first concern is to build a track record. Like you, my ears perked up when a caller on the last conference call suggested a fund built around re-performing notes from Jeff Gordon. You were going to put together an info graphic or road map.I am very interested in pursuing that course. Let&#39;s make it happen. Great that you are providing the continuing ed in audio only form as well.        </p>

          Love the idea. However, there is nothing that states in the Constitution of this fine country that you must invest in real estate within 50 miles of where you live. <br><br>I used to run a 5mm “friends and family” hard money fund when I lived in NYC… and that’s further away than New Mexico. *So that excuse isn’t going to work for me.* <br><br>I would make a few loans using what you learned from the Hard Money Financier workshop first in Texas with High Net Worth Individual money. <br>If you don’t get shot, then go ahead and start raising 5mm. The folks who “seeded” you will also give you a few bucks into this as well. Ask me how I know this. <br><br>Continue to place yourself in a position of prominence. Join social clubs such as the Lion’s Club, church activity boards, boards of non-profits such as St. Jude, etc. Then talk their ear off about how passionate you are about this. The money will always follow the passion. <br><br>Lastly, it’s Dave Gordon. Not Jeff Gordon, the NASCAR hero…  <br><br>I’m here to help but I don’t think you need to pay me a bunch of money yet to do your deck and fund set up for you yet. However, I will give you an elevator speech here for these guys: <br><br>*We have a finance strategy.  We think that this market - we don’t think this is the time to buy.  We don’t want to be the guy at the auction raising his hand to pay the last dollar.  We are a strategy of providing capital to qualified investors and rehabbers to control real estate. This is not lending to owner occupants, widows and orphans. That is a much regulated market. I want to be clear on this, we’re only providing capital to qualified individuals with a proven track record to control and get taken out of deals quickly.  We think this market is a big is a credit market dislocation, not a real estate dislocation.  We&#39;re going to be a capital provider in a market where there&#39;s very little capital. That&#39;s it.  And, we&#39;re going to get overpaid going up. <br><br>The fund will only be making first trust deed or mortgage loans at a very low LTVs. We’re going to be in residential, that’s the space we know best and don’t plan to deviate from that. <br><br>We firmly believe that the genesis of this market down turn has been the death of capital. During the credit boom, homes traded quickly because subprime was the fulcrum for unqualified folks to get in to the market.  <br><br>Today we believe that these assets have been repriced to more sane and palatable levels for us to capture the opportunity. The time to get in is now. <br><br>I want to make sure we focus here that in the past, the RMS machine market facilitated ‘no-money’ down deals. The whole private label securitization scheme. <br><br>SteveCo will be making very few, if any loans to borrowers that don’t have something at risk in the game at the time of purchase. <br>This isn’t our first rodeo. We’ve been doing trades/loans, etc collectively in this space for the past xxx years. We have the infrastructure to manage this, we have the relationships for meaningful deal flow. We have proven we can be taken out quickly.  And most importantly we’re very intimate with our housing stock within our geography. Many people in this space got hurt because they were brokers managing private mortgage pools who were’nt operators. Essentially they were carnival barkers who didn’t know what they were doing. That is not us. We are granular operators. We’re not afraid to ask for the keys. More on that in a moment. <br><br>STEVECO will not deviate from its core business principles or criteria. No second mortgages, no luxury homes, no land, nothing illiquid. This is an income fund that we believe is well collateralized given the low LTVs we will be lending on. <br>We may add a little juice, but right now, we’ll be unlevered until we see enough to move forward. <br><br>We firmly believe the edge that we have is our ability to meaningfully source consistent deal flow. We’ve been involved as a principle or have traded approximately XX million in real estate. Our track record of cultivating real and substantive deal flow is why we’re coming to the capital markets. <br>Our strategy is this: all of our loans are going to be short term with a 1 year duration. <br><br>If the market forces change, we’ll be in a position to extend the duration of the loans up to 4 years. Because this is an income fund, we feel as though it’s in the best interest to keep the money out on the street rather than trying to churn and burn it, provided our borrower is timely with payments. We won’t be the big bad wolf and foreclose immediately, we’re always going to set the expectations of the relationship with out borrowers, but we’re smart enough to know that if he has to rent it out for an extended period of time for seasoning issue or otherwise, that’ good. <br><br>We’re going to be in control. <br><br>We don’t want to arbitrarily create any expense events where there is not a return being made. <br><br>Our investment process is very comprehensive. Without getting into the granularities, we’ve mapped out here how we manage our business from the “first call to the close… and most importantly post-closing. <br><br>We want to make sure our prospective investors understand that we do a lot of desktop research before we go hard on expenses and we do not go hard on expenses until we get an executed Term Sheet back from our borrower and application fee in cash.  <br><br>We’ve been very keen to find out why our competitors in this space have failed. we’ve learned a lot and have adapted these values to our core model for risk management. <br><br>Other guys were, completely equity based, borrower never had any skin in the game. <br><br>They did not verify income or borrower’s ability to repay the loan.<br><br>They didn’t have any cohesive underwriting guidelines, got into other markets with a seemingly lower barrier entry that they didn’t understand.  <br><br>They tried too hard to compete with subprime and were aggressive LTV’s<br><br>Most importantly they never thought about whether or not their borrower was going to make a profit. <br><br>Our experience tells us that the loan has a much higher likelihood of being performing up until it matures if it is underwritten so that the borrowers’ best interests are in mind. If he doesn’t make any money, neither will we.*<br>        </p>

          Sal, Outstanding conference call today. People got a lot smarter, and a few brains may have imploded. I am absolutely interested in the pricing product you are contemplating.<br><br>As to your comment that women make better stock traders than men; according to a research paper cited (but not written) by a nobel prize winner for economics titled &quot;Boys will be Boys&quot; you are correct. However the paper does not attribute it to a sixth sense women possess, but rather &quot;they showed that men acted on their useless ideas significantly more often than women, and that as a result women achieved better investment results than men.&quot; Perhaps that is a sixth sense though the we often refer to as common?<br><br>So, the capital formation B team members are not eligible for the download this weekend?        </p>

          This was an incredible live event and I thought it had more meat and was even presented better than the videos of the first event. I have been watering at the mouth waiting for this release, and the timing is great. Thanks Sal!         </p>
