          Refi to pay out a $2M judgment lien.  I have an antique shop owner who owns 7000 SF shop bldg in CA.  She says she has a $2M judgment lien on her property.  This lien is generated by a law suit from 1 business to another.  She lost her case so the lien is attached to her business bldg, which she owns out right free and clear.  She got an offer from Coldwell Banker for $3.8M but turned down b/c she wants to keep the bldg.  I didn&#39;t pursue further, but I think we can possibly treat the written offer an appraisal, can&#39;t we?  About 3 years ago, her gross income (need to check with her CPA to find out her NOI) is about $3-$4M/yr but b/c of illness her business went down.  Her current gross income is about $100k to $200/yr.  She owns the bldg outright free and clear so no mortgage.  Our bridge loan interest is 10%-12%.  So, I did a quick mortgage calc for a $2M loan with 12% interest.  The monthly is about $21k.  It&#39;s a matter of whether she can make her monthly payment or not from her business.  And her income is strictly generated by her business.  She could also rent the bldg out but she choose to run her business instead of renting it.  This is an unusual request.  I know we have 5 data points to pursue, but this is unusual since she only use her loan (once she refi) to pay her judgment lien.  She wants to keep the bldg and her business that&#39;s why she want to get a loan instead of accepting the Coldwell Bankers offer.  Should I pursue this deal (if it&#39;s a deal)?  Her data point is strange. Obviously her &quot;sources and use&quot; is to pay off the lien, and one of her Exit Strategy is to sue (or counter-sue) the people who sued her and gave her the judgment lien, b/c they not only still owed her money but also falsify some legal documents.  She could also rent her bldg out while suing in case her business didn&#39;t pick up b/c she&#39;s still sick and still recuperating.<br><br>Any suggestions will be appreciated.  Thanks.<br><br>Luan        </p>

          just a quick update.  The owner can rent the bldg out for $35k/mo to $40k/mo from the going rate in the neighborhood.  Also, she is in the process to sell an antique painting for $1.5M which can be repaid to principal, but it&#39;ll be in 30 days till she get that money.  Her deadline for the lien (she is foreclosure right now) is late Feb/early Mar.  And she needs to pay it in full not partial.  I begin to think it&#39;s a deal and it&#39;s doable.  It&#39;s just how fast we can quickly turn this around.  Just need your input.  Thanks.        </p>

          Luan,<br>Different people have different appetites so someone out there may find interest in your deal but when reviewing your information I have the following concerns and comments that will hopefully provide you with some value.<br>1) Provide the meat to the deal upfront. Save the narrative or country music song after you&#39;ve given your prospective funding sources something to analyze in a few minutes otherwise there not going to even bother.  Dandrew tends to be a bit more gentle when it comes to this, but the rest of the capital markets will just delete your message and move on, eventually flagging you all together.<br>2) Without getting into too much I&#39;ll stick to the main issue...cash flow.<br>In the current market place those with capital are only concerned with one thing, income producing assets. So if you are going to put weight on any one data point more than anything else it should be income and more importantly net operating income. For example, you provided gross income 3 years ago which to be honest doesn’t mean much, especially when you consider the uncertainty of the actual business she is running (antiques) and the ongoing health concerns.  You then provided the recent gross income of $100k, so at a 10 cap (which is generous) this deal, to a funding source, is only worth $1mm, but that’s gross, the net is obviously less and is the number that matters most, keeping in mind that debt service isn’t calculated in NOI so free and clear or not doesn’t matter, there is still some type of operating expenses, utilities, etc, debt service comes after, which would also kill this deal.  It might be worth more to a prospective buyer who sees a more lucrative use for the property, however an offer doesn’t dictate value and is not the same as an appraisal, which by the way is also, in many cases, meaningless to a funding source.  I could “write” you an offer tomorrow for $10mm, but that doesn’t constitute real market value, unless I actually close, but if there aren’t similar sales at that price level in the area it would likely be considered a one-off sale and not seen as a useable comp.  <br>So without getting into my additional concerns such as small square footage, mom&amp; pop standalone retail, and so on, I don’t think this is a deal for the significant fact that it doesn’t have the cash flow or financials to merit funding.  The only thing that comes to mind is cross-collateral. If the sponsor has other real estate owned or assets that would help hedge the risk of a $2mm loan then maybe you can keep this one alive, but I wouldn’t fall in love with this deal, or any deal for that matter, especially not those short on cash flow. Stick to the numbers in the beginning and make a quick subjective analysis and proceed as necessary from there.<br>However, like I said, that’s just my opinion and how I look at it and in no way means that you couldn’t find a loan based on some other criteria, but I don’t think this is something that is worth a considerable amount of time. Good luck!        </p>

          Thanks Jon for the input.  I wasn&#39;t going to put country music on commercial deals but I thought this case is bit unusual for Dandrew community. So country music may paint a better picture than cold and dry data which you guys will have questions for them later.  Anyway, will try to put more meat and less music next time.<br>But in your opinion, would antique items like paintings be considered as asset for cross collateral?<br>Also, if cash flow from her business is no good, would renting her bldg out at $40k/month be something to think about?  Right now current NOI is shot for most people anyway, but we don&#39;t just look for that in our data point right? If her Exit Strategy is to rent the bldg out and achieve a monthly NOI at $25k or $300k/yr.  Her bldg is in LA and according Marcus and Millichaps it&#39;s about $250/sf right now.  Her bldg is 7000 SF or about $1.75M.  So at 65% LTV it would be about $1.14M.  The question is would anybody be willing to lend $1M+ for a retail single tenant bldg?        </p>

          Luan, this is not the type of deal that Dandrew funds, it would not be worth your time and how would you get paid and would she be able to make her payments? I think you should go to the next deal.         </p>

          Thanks for your input, nursedeb.  Are you a Dandrew employee?  I thought the course says I could make money from origination points (front end) and early termination/pay-off (back end) and interest rate spread.  The owner is making her payment through her current business of selling antique merchandise and interior design contract work.  The backup plan is to rent out the entire bldg which is $35k-$40k/month. She may only need $1M+.        </p>

          Luan, I am a Dandrew student, I would say it sounds ver risky. All you have to do is submit the 5 data points to Sal and he will give you an answer. Good luck. Deb        </p>

          Luan. Thank you for your questions. Dandrew would not look to fund this deal.<br>1) We only consider retail deals that are grocery or pharmacy anchored (the thinking being that we all need to eat and get prescriptions/vitamins etc).<br>2) As Jon points out the estimated value of the asset is well below the loan request.<br>3) Current NOI would not be sufficient to support the debt. <br>4) The lawsuit is against the company and she is looking to leverage her asset to pay the company&#39;s debts. In essence, a cashout refi, whereby the money is going somewhere else and not to the asset (which is what we would look for).  <br>5) We do not like the scenario whereby the owner is the sole tenant of the building. The income of the business is directly proportional to the health of the owner. Would you/your company look to lend this person money knowing that her ability to make repayments depends on her health and ability to sell antiques/interior design work? With the lawsuit and pending foreclosure, this can only add to the stress...<br>6) Cross-collateral - our business is Real Estate and would recommend sticking to this for cross-collateral as we can value it. <br>7) Being able to rent out the remainder of the building seems to be a useful and welcome boost to overall cashflow no? Of course, this depends on the liklihood of her losing the property and how much time she has to complete this (not everyone wishes to work at boosting occupancy if likely to lose the property). If she has been focusing on the business and not had time to do this then she should certainly consider using a professional. <br>I hope that this helps to outline the thinking behind our standpoint.         </p>

          Sal - There seems to be a disparity between the manual pg. 48 which states &quot;most recent terms between 11-16% and 4-6 points&quot; vs. the inetusa private banking website Lending Parameters which states interest rate 10-14% and origination fee 2-3 points. Why the difference? Thanks, Gary &amp; Judy        </p>

          Gary and Judy: The reason is simple, inetusa hasn&#39;t updated the revised stips yet. <br><br>As time has gone on, availability of capital has gotten more precious and hence more expensive.         </p>

          Speaking of the latest, do we still lend &quot;up to 75% LTV&quot; as indicated on the website?  Can we get the latest COMPLETE lending terms?  I called around and talked to other commercial HML, and they all say LTV is from 50% and up to 65% now.  The inetusa website says 75% LTV.  I have a feeling this isn&#39;t true.        </p>

          We can lend up to 75% LTV, but that does not mean that every deal would be funded at this level. You may expect a range of 60-65% currently. For retail deals, this would be something closer to 50%. Every deal is unique, so it is hard to put every one into a predefined bracket.         </p>

          Per Corey&#39;s comments on the last conference call, to get a tape so we could look &quot;bundle&quot; these loans into one large portfolio...I made the request to the banker and he replied back as follows, &quot;We don&#39;t have a &#39;tape&#39; that we release. What specifically are you looking for and how does your process work? Is there a range of value that you typically pay per asset compared to par value? Can you provide more information to allow me the opportunity of adequately deciphering whether there might be an opportunity to work together?&quot; Can you advise me on how best to reply?

          a gentlemen asked me if he can get a short term $2.5M using his office bldg as collateral to fund his energy contract selling business.  I told him I don&#39;t know.  I told him to send me a strong write up about his business operation and I&#39;ll get back to him.  If this is his exit strategy, do we do something like this?        </p>

          Luan. This is very like the antiques dealer scenario. The loan is made with the asset as collateral, yet the money is going to something else such as paying off business debts or to inject capital into a business. This would be outside of our wheelhouse. The key is looking to where the money is going to be used. If this $2.5mm was to, for example, pay off the existing lender on the property then we could certainly look at this.         </p>

          Luan. If this is regarding the bridge loan for the borrower to use the proceeds to fund his energy business then we will be unable to help. No matter how good a deal the person has told you it is...        </p>

          I have question about an antique shop woman who needs to refinance to pay out a $2M business judgment lien otherwise she&#39;ll be foreclosed in about 2 months.  I misplaced this post in &quot;Distressed Commercial&quot; discussion.  Would you mind read it over there?  Otherwise, I can copy and paste the same stuff over here.  I need to know if Dandrew has any interest in this potential deal or not.  If so, what necessary docs I should be gathering b/c this one may not be a typical refi you guys usually see.        </p>
