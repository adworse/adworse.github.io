          Would it be possible to have a Continuing Ed on sourcing deals? I&#39;m finding that having CRE intellectual capital doesn&#39;t help much if you don&#39;t have any deals coming to you. The deals that do come to me usually come from a third party. So far they just end up dying and my bank account is dying right along with them.<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>What should our approach be with brokers who potentially have borrowers looking to purchase a multi-family property that has a CMBS loan on it?  I assume we are searching on Loopnet for properties that have assumable loans so we can ultimately contact the brokers to let them know how we can help get the deal closed.<br><br>I believe the step by step search that Mattt was supposed to demonstrate in a video was left out.  I sent the Helpdesk a message about the video, but I was hoping you could provide some guidance on approaching the brokers involved.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Bill        </p>

          These CMBS loans can&#39;t get refinanced because they have defeaseances that make it prohibitive to do so. <br><br>What Matt was showing you was a way for you to assume these assets with these loans. <br><br>I have a model I&#39;m putting together which will stress how much debt the asset could tolerate before it doesn&#39;t make sense and the outgo is more than the income. <br><br>This is going to be released as a model soon for you to use when I&#39;m finished with it.         </p>

          Sal,<br><br>What&#39;s your impression of the person who sent me the message below via LinkedIn? Do you think he&#39;s just trying to broker notes and REOs and should I bother responding to him?<br><br>&quot;We are seeking U.S Single Family Houses &amp; Commercial Apartment Buildings in Bulk REO Tapes and individual off-market wholesale deals. <br><br>We are able to purchase up to 10 Million USD worth of properties at a time in bank tapes. Any zip codes within our parameters. <br><br>Now highlighting individual off-market wholesale deals, our price point can start from very low and up to a very high price point. Just as long as the numbers make sense that&#39;s all it matters. <br><br>We will consider all real estate investment opportunities and only within our parameters. <br><br>If your deals are at great prices, we will continually buy! <br><br>Please email us lists of what you have available to: webuynotes@gmail.com&quot;  (I made up the part before gmail.com)<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I was at the January event.  I can&#39;t make every one.  I thought Ask Dandrew was here to serve for getting questions answered.  Has that changed now to where we must travel to get an answer?  <br><br>I was a VIP at the January event and still haven&#39;t received the DVD&#39;s from that event.  It would be great to be able to refer to those as I&#39;m working on something related to what was covered at the event.<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Bill, this is AJ.  I am unclear of the context of your question:  &quot; some helpful info on this,&quot;  on what, exactly?<br><br>Well, I tried to figure out what you were asking about before I replied, and I found a June 20 question from you asking about DVDs and AskDandrew still being here to answer your question (which it most certainly is, thus you getting me live answering your question now).<br><br>The only thing that makes us want to stop giving quality answers on AskDandrew would be when we need to field questions that really need to go to our help desk.<br><br>So, now that I&#39;ve given you a mild shaming for that, I went the extra mile and checked to see that you went to TheCommercialHelpDesk.com and asked about the January CQSI videos.  I see you created a new case there at nearly the exact same time that you posted this question on AskDandrew.<br><br>So, if this is what you are referring to, then we will handle it over there at the help desk.<br><br>I oversee the help desk, so Bill, I will personally see that your question there gets answered.<br><br>We&#39;ll be waiting here for your deal and training content related questions,<br><br>Thanks,<br>-AJ        </p>

          AJ,<br><br>Thank you for the response. My last comment in this thread was related to my initial question to Sal where I asked him how to connect to HNI. He told me to remind him after the conference and he would give me a &quot;substantive answer.&quot; That&#39;s what I was attempting to do (remind him). I see it didn&#39;t get received as I thought it would.<br><br>In regards to my mentioning of the conference DVD&#39;s in a previous question, I only brought that up since Sal said he would answer my question at this last conference. When I was telling him I was at the January conference and could not make this last conference, I just happen to throw in the fact that we had not received the conference DVD&#39;s as part of being a VIP. I did not come on to AskDandrew to specifically ask about the status of conference DVD&#39;s for I know it is not the place to do that. Forgive me for casually mentioning it in the same breath with another comment.<br><br>So, my &quot;some helpful info on this&quot; was me asking for Sal&#39;s &quot;substantive answer&quot; to the best way to connect with HNI.<br><br>Thank you.<br>Bill        </p>

          Bill<br><br>The answer is networking at the appropriate conferences and events. We spend about $100,000 a year on networking events. Its an expense few are willing to spend and hence the air is sweeter and the relationships formed are tighter. <br><br>Other areas are using our new FundingSoft platform or using preqin.com subscription which costs $15,000 per year. <br><br>*Networks aren’t free. They never have been and never will be for a reason.*<br><br>*So my answer to your question is this: How much do you want to invest in building your network?&quot;*<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I just finished listening to your sponsor calls in the JV Equity vs Fund Structures training where you had phone calls with the Cavan sponsor back in 2012. I was surprised to hear that you were working to get them equity through Daniel. I reached out to Daniel on a prior deal, but the equity amount was below his minimum.<br><br>I&#39;m working with a sponsor now who is looking to purchase a self-storage facility in Utah and wants a long term equity provider to help him purchase multiple self-storage facilities at a time to build his portfolio.<br><br>1. Before I introduce the equity capital provider to the sponsor, do you recommend I get him to sign an NDA with me. <br><br>2. Second, how much of a fee should I seek on a $2mm JV equity deal? (Would it be best to use the graduated scale for equity in the brokerage agreement that is provided through Dandrew?) If so, that would make for a $100k fee, right?<br><br>3. Along with getting a fee when the initial equity is invested, is it possible to also get a fee at the time when the equity investor is taken out?<br><br>Thank you.<br>Bill        </p>

          Cavan went bankrupt I believe. They had some major problems. <br><br>1. I would want you to get the fee agreement signed. <br><br>2. Use the graduated scale. Equity is more expensive hence higher fees to you. <br><br>3. That is an equity kicker. I&#39;m not sure about that, as that is negotiable. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Bill, <br><br>Good question.  It needs to be a rural community somewhere in the midwest, not larger than 15k people in population, where the story has been the sole broadline retailer (general goods &amp; pharmacy) for more than a decade, and where the nearest competitive broadline retailer (like a Walmart, Target, etc) is more than a 40 minute drive away.<br><br>Also, cost basis is key.  We target 9-11 % cap rates on the transactions, with over 5 years left on the lease.  Extensions don&#39;t count.  If there is less, the cap must be higher, and I must have confidence that I can strong-arm the tenant into renewal &quot;the AJ way&quot;.<br><br>It&#39;s a tall order, but that&#39;s how we think.  That&#39;s what works well.<br><br>Do you have anything that is in this ballpark?<br><br>-AJ        </p>

          Bill,<br><br>I see that you&#39;ve been a Private Equiteer for about a year, which is great!  You are allowed to send Performing Note tapes to us.  <br><br>However, the depth of your question should really be directed to Dave Gordon on our bulk pool desk.  The only way our intermediaries interact directly with him is through AskDandrew Silver, and I see that you&#39;re not a member of that.<br><br>You are giving us verbose lists of cities, but we have no idea whether we&#39;re dealing with resi, commercial, or what in each city, nor do we have any idea how rough the product is.<br><br>These are crucial things for all who deal in bulk pools to understand.<br><br>What you&#39;re really missing out on, is access to the REO/NPN/PN bulk pool heatmap current market color that Dave provides there.  You should be able to look at that, compare it to tapes like these, and have a good idea to value it yourself.  Then you can do the heavy lifting yourself, confidently, being able to face off with your seller, and tell him where you see these things trading at, and why.<br><br>So, you can send it over, but for such a cacophony of product, in order for you to understand the complexities of this well enough to actually cross a trade, I would need to suggest AskDandrew Silver.<br><br>Call Tracy at 866.325.2336 and she can get you set up on that.<br><br>Or, you can submit this to our deal desk and take your chances, but you really want to understand these well enough to cross a trade here, right?<br><br>Call Tracy to get set up.<br><br>Best of luck with this one, <br>AJ<br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I&#39;m trying to find a buyer for a ~$300mm Starwood hotel. I&#39;ve reached out to a REIT who would like to buy it unencumbered of brand and management. The seller is willing to do that. I haven&#39;t provided any financials to my REIT contact yet. He said in an email that they are likely looking for an 8% return. How would I determine that for my own knowledge?  What numbers would I look at?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Then you have no deal. For $300 million, if the buyer wants to put it under their flag, then that is what its going to take to close this deal.         </p>

          OK. You&#39;ve put a lot of questions into there. Let me answer your question. <br><br>Do you have financials for this hotel? Do you have an Confi signed with the seller?         </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Yes I&#39;ve signed a confi with the seller.

          So you waited until you signed a document to determine who is paying you? Looks like this is dead. <br><br>REITs don&#39;t need short term capital providers like us. They are flush with cash, generally speaking.        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Is AskDandrew going to the way side now that you have created theinvestorssyndicate.com? Since I already have a credibility website through AskDandrew, will it and the information it contains be inferior to what you have available on theinvestorssyndicate.com? Will theinvestorssyndicate.com now be the place we should go to increase our intellectual capital instead of AskDandrew. Just a little perplexed about what the new website and source of information means since I&#39;ve already invested in AskDandrew.<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Hey Sal, just to clarify, the investorsyndicate.com mentions a credibility website but that is the same one we currently have with inetUSA correct? I know awhile back you had mentioned some changes were coming to the private banker website. Hopefully you can clarify that on the call on Friday. Also, any possibility of having a website geared specifically for hard money? It is Christmas so I thought I would ask! Thanks!        </p>

          Hello Sal and/or A.J.,<br><br>On todays AskDandrew call there was a question of interest regarding doing business with banks, specifically helping them clear their balance sheets by recapitalizing undesired loans on their books.  My follow-on question is once we&#39;ve given our elevator speech to bank and they respond positively that they do have loan(s) we can work with, do we continue the conversation with the bank or do we transition to discussions with the sponsor?  In either scenario, what would be the next step for me, the intermediary, to move this deal forward? How do we transition the conversation?<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>Chris        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Perhaps my example wasn&#39;t clear or maybe I don&#39;t understand.  As an Intermediary we call on banks to help clear up their balance sheets by buying their undesirable loans, but because we are not buyers rather financiers there must be a sponsor attached to the loan in order for Dandrew or other institution to fund the deals.  I&#39;m thinking that the current sponsor stays in place, depending on the scenario, or I find a new sponsor.  In either case that initial conversation with the banker has to transition to move the deal along.  By your response to my post I&#39;m guessing that you assume I am the buyer.  Am I correct, or do you need to pull me back on the tracks?<br><br>Chris        </p>

          Thanks, Sal!  How might one properly keep a deal moving after it&#39;s determined the bank has the right type of deal for us to fund?  I&#39;ve started going back through the training but have yet found this transition explained.  Thanks in advance!<br><br>Chris        </p>

          Christopher: <br><br>I&#39;m going to make you sweat this one out.

          [SCENARIO] &quot;Mr. Banker, at IndyCal Capital we specialize in recapitalizing the debt of slow paying borrowers. We can work with the existing borrower or bring in a new sponsor to purchase the note, in which we will fund said purchase.  In either scenario, IndyCal will provide a great service to your bank by removing the &quot;problem loans&quot; from your books.  Mr. Banker, shall I provide my direct email to send these loans or will you provide a hard copy for my review?&quot;<br><br>[MY THOUGHTS]  My first thought, Sal, is the banker may or may not care if I work with existing borrower or bring in a new sponsor to purchase the debt.  However, I should be able and prepared for either scenario.  The reason I asked the question in the first place was of uncertainty of perhaps losing any credibility with the bank if; (1) I start to gather the data points from the banker directly, and/or (2) I ask to be connected with the borrower to discuss funding his purchase of his own loan at a discount.  <br><br>How did I do?  What guidance can you share at this point?        </p>

          Christopher. <br><br>This needs to be tweaked a bit. Make it sound more intimate, not like they are calling Wells Fargo. “It’s a wonderful day at Wells Fargo, how can we help you!?”<br><br>Tell them that you’re a private capital provider and that you play throughout the capital structure. And that you’re desk specializes specifically in recapitalizing those 911 calls. Those are those borrowers who are being forced to pay off their loan on an accelerated basis or have the opportunity to buy their own note back. Your desk provides institutional coverage for banks like theirs (smaller ones) and can either work with the borrower directly or advise you on pricing and other market color so you can mark your books. <br><br>Then shut up. <br><br>Got it? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>In preparing for my calls to banks this week, I&#39;ve printed a list of hundreds of banks.  The first bank I review has over 1,500 commercial loans under the category, &quot;Assets in non accrual status&quot;.  Is this a category to focus on?  These are non-performing I&#39;m assuming, correct?<br><br>Should I be looking under the &quot;Past Due and non accrual assets&quot; for loans to recapitalize and &quot;Other Real Estate Owned&quot; for purchasing of property?  Am I heading in the right direction here?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Chris        </p>

          Bill<br><br>Let&#39;s narrow this. Are you a member of AskDandrew Silver? That is where these deals would be best answered. <br><br>Second, what are you trying to do. The question you&#39;re asking is not really a good one. I need to know what&#39;s in the bag of groceries.

          Sal,<br><br>In refernece to your &quot;The question you&#39;re asking is not really a good one&quot;, that&#39;s why I started my message by saying &quot;I&#39;m trying to understand.&quot; I have an IT background not a finance background, and I didn&#39;t go to Harvard. I&#39;ve been through the Bulk REO videos and associated documentation. I don&#39;t recall seeing a deal example of what I am asking about. If there is one, please excuse me and direct me to that deal example. <br><br>I understand the below $60k assets being dogsh**. If someone comes to me and says &quot;Bill, I just recieved a tape of NPN from the bank of 70 single family homes where the BPO of each is $60k or greater. These homes are in a gated community. Everyone keeps their grass green and their homes in excellent shape. I need $5mm to take down this pool of assets. Can you help me with the $5mm? If so, how can you help? <br><br>Now, considering they have experience and can demonstrate this in their bios and provide the 3 points you mentioned earlier, how can I help them?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Bill<br><br>AJ was in IT too and he didn&#39;t got to Harvard either. But you correctly asked the question this way. <br><br>1.

          Sal,<br><br>Would this interest you at all?  Sponsor is looking for a bridge loan request of $4.3mm for the rehab and remodel of a historic 12 story full service hotel in Kentucky? The hotel originally opened in 1963 and later shut down in the 1970&#39;s. The hotel is currently in its final stages of 100% demolition of the interior. Flag hotels are being introduced to the site now.<br>New hotel construction has taken place in the past year near this hotel to include Hampton Inn &amp; Suites in 2014, Holiday Inn in 2015, and a Courtyard Inn &amp; Suites 2009, completed PIP refresh in 2015. Along with the hotels, a New 95,000 sq.ft. Convention Conference Center opened in 2014.<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          So by asking this you&#39;re saying the sponsor has similar experience managing hotels like these flags and that you&#39;ve already qualified him / her first - and you didn&#39;t approach the other sponsors who are working with flags because *your* sponsor is someone you&#39;d invest your life savings with, correct?         </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Can you give me some guidance on this project I just started working on? I am in conversation with what appears to be the developer on the project. He is working with a well-known four star flag hotel (he refers to as his client) to develop a mixed use retail destination to include two or three hotels where the main flag will be a four star, restaurants, entertainment venue, retail, etc. This project will be about 40 miles south of Anaheim. They have a second similar project that will also need funding in AZ.  <br><br>The developer said this is a $300-$450mm project in California that can break ground in six months or less. This is a world class hotel chain that wants to expand rapidly. He said they have 4-6 other sites already surveyed that the client likes with one being near downtown L.A. The developer said they are particularly interested in a group that can raise the money for a long series of hotels.<br><br>I have a fund that is interested in potentially funding this project in California. After signing the developer&#39;s NDA, I sent him the requested information that the fund wants to review regarding the project/sponsor.<br><br>Can you answer my numbered questions below regarding the steps I should take to get compensated should this deal actually fund and close? In your five minute Commercial Deal Structuring Secrets video, you said the term sheet is pre-negotiated. So, here are my questions:<br><br>1. Should I create a brokerage agreement letter outlining my fees to present to the sponsor or do I only need to negotiate my fees with the capital provider before the term sheet is written?<br><br>2. Is it asking too much to request a 1% upfront point on a deal this size? Is that a customary amount or is it less in a deal this size?<br><br>3. Should I attempt to get the upfront point and interest spread? If so, what amount for each would you say is reasonable on this deal?<br><br>I know a .25 point on a deal this size is a lot, and I don&#39;t want to appear greedy.  However, at the same time, I don&#39;t want to sell myself short.  <br><br>Please share your wisdom with me on this deal so I can hopefully make you proud.<br><br><br>Thank you.<br>Bill        </p>

          Bill: <br><br>*”...appears to be a developer.”*<br><br>If your wife or girlfriend said she appeared to be pregnant, would this sit well with you? You need to figure that part out. <br><br>Is this fund real? Did you do a check on them? Google Search? How do you know they are real? <br><br>Regarding your questions, (assuming you take the pregnancy test before going deep here) below are my questions: <br><br>1.    Negotiate the fees with the capital provider first, then before the term sheet is presented, get those same fees/incentives agreed to in writing with the Engagement Letter. If you have a fake capital provider, you will look foolish. <br><br>2.  Its going to be more of *0.25% - 0.5%* of a point probably. Larger the deals, the smaller the %, *but keep in mind that the $’s are much larger to you…*. Don’t be a greedy pig.<br><br>3.  I would avoid interest rate spread as in development deals, that is seen as being too aggressive and, well more abrasive to the developer. He has no cash flow coming in, and you want to step on his jugular. <br>*I would negotiate an equity stake in the management company for this at founder’s share prices.*. <br><br>Are you coming to the conference in January? If not, you should. That is unless you plan on being dead. If you’re not dead, you need to be in Las Vegas. This is the 2nd day stuff we’ll be discussing. Make me proud by coming to Vegas to talk about this juicy action here. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Thanks for your resonse.<br><br>&quot;...appears to be a developer.&quot; Yes I know. I should never make a statement such as &quot;appears to be, I think, sort of, kind of&quot; or otherwise that comes across as less than certain. I said that though because I knew he wasn&#39;t a broker, but at the same time, he didn&#39;t give me his position within the project. <br><br>Yes the fund is real. I know of someone else who is actively using this fund on his deals. <br><br>I attempted to signup for the January conference this past Monday. I thought we had until midnight on Monday to pay the full $997. When I went to sign up, I saw the price had doubled. I created a ticket with the HelpDesk, but no one ever followed up on it after the customary response saying &quot;your request is being assigned to a team member.&quot; I was hoping to meet you and feel like a &quot;Big Dawg&quot; for a day.<br><br>How much of an equity stake should I seek on a deal like this? <br><br>This is one project with many similar projects in the works. This is a huge hotel chain that wants to expand to other locations worldwide. (so my contact tells me)<br><br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I need your help! My contact on this deal is trying to vet me before moving forward. He is not the principal/developer but more like their &quot;right-hand man.&quot; The fund manager wanted to setup a conference call for Monday. I relayed this to my contact. Instead of working to make that happen, he comes back with questions about the fund which I copied below.<br>************************************************************************************************************************<br><br>1. What are your sources of funds? (Not names, just   types, sizes.)<br>2. What is your history on large projects, say, above $100mm?<br>3. How long of a cycle are you projecting for projects such as this?<br><br>Many of these deals are going to need predevelopment dollars that usually come from HNW individuals, and they usually own a piece of the GP. <br>1. Do you have those resources? <br><br>We have similar situations in Texas, Aruba, and   Curacao. Others in the works.<br>1. Can you handle those?<br>2. Then the question becomes how large can you go? <br>************************************************************************************************************************<br><br>I shared this with the fund and they basically said they&#39;e not going to jump through hoops answering his questions when a phone call with the principals can do the same.<br><br>I relayed this to my contact and he responded with this:<br>************************************************************************************************************************<br><br>&quot;We have a call today at 4:00 with a FINRA registered Investment Banker, broker, and former developer. This is our third call, we have vetted him, and this took four days to set up. We know who he is talking to and have given him exclusives for several entities. But we know these entities from other connections. They have a market reputation, something you lack, at least to our knowledge.<br>I can’t find you on FINRA’s search, unless you are nested in the pages of “William Clark” entries. No info on Highrise, except on your own website.<br>Here, you are asking for a phone call that will take me hours and days to set up, but won’t cooperate with my needs for preliminary vetting before I can go there. This isn’t a good start.<br>We have shown you what we have (but only one project) but we know nothing except what the website tells us, and this doesn’t answer any serious questions.<br>The text below says “The fund is here.” Does this mean you are a fund or not? The text is ambiguous. If so, how much money can you put into one deal if you decide to do so. Knowing who you are talking to is important. Giving access to people you don’t really know is not something I am big on, but you can decide if you want to give me the information requested or not.&quot;<br>************************************************************************************************************************<br><br>Sal how should I respond to my contact. I know the fund does not want to invest a lot of time in the preliminary minutia if these guys are shopping around their project(s). I could use your experience and wisdom here.<br><br>Thank you.<br>Bill        </p>

          Good morning Bill.  I&#39;m new to this group and could not resist to chime in on your request of Sal to guide you with advice to handle this contact who seems to have more $100mm deals in the pipeline than any normal intermediary would see in a life time.  Reading your post gave me flashbacks to when a mortgage broker friend of mine (who is no longer a friend) tried to get me to work leads that came from a website blog called &quot;Broker Outhouse&quot;, sorry that slipped out. It was actually called &quot;Broker Outpost&quot;.   Seemed that everybody had deals flowing in from everywhere, but nobody seemed to have any sources.  The dialogue was very similar to what you are getting from this guy.  The first thing I would ask this guy is, since he has this FINRA broker who has access to what he wants, is he going to treat you the same way after you go to all the trouble to jump through his hoops!?  The one thing I hate about this business is those damned bright shiny objects ($100mm deals) that look so beautiful, and have so much promise that go nowhere and result in nothing but guilt and shame.  I start everyday with the same prayer, Lord keep me focused on the basics, I&#39;ll take the $3-5mm deals over the $100mm+ deals every day!  If I am ever blessed enough to actually have a first hand relationship with investors with that kind of horsepower, then and only then, will I get into that arena.  Hope this helps.           </p>

          Thanks Chris for taking the time to chime in! That does help. Thanks Sal for your response. You surprise me with your humor sometimes (referencing &quot;hit by a bus&quot; north of 51st)!!  I&#39;m glad to see people can have humor in this business like &quot;Broker Outhouse.&quot;<br><br>One thought that did come to my mind Sal when you said &quot;let&#39;s think through this&quot; was why is this guy even talking to me when he is on his third call with this FINRA registered Investment Banker that he has vetted and appears to have all the connections. <br><br>I see the point you both are making. I won&#39;t play into his games. I could banter back with him and tell him his questions are basically asking me how much a bag of groceries weigh without knowing what&#39;s in the bag. However, I think I&#39;ll just nip it in the bud and tell him if he doesn&#39;t get the funding he needs after shopping it around to get back with me.<br><br><br>Thanks again!!<br>Bill        </p>

          Good morning, Bill.  Isn&#39;t it obvious? There is no &quot;FINRA registered investment banker&quot;, he wants to get to your source by intimidating you with his big shot talk.          </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Can you provide some guidance on this? I am working on a $56mm new construction deal with another Dandrew intermediary. I&#39;ll refer to him as intermediaryA and myself as intermediaryB. IntermediaryA received the deal from a broker. I came into the deal as intermediaryB since I have a lender with interest in funding the deal. IntermediaryA and myself have agreed to split the 1% fee 50/50, and we want to make sure we don&#39;t get screwed out of receiving the fee. I have modified the Engagement Letter and Brokerage Fee form to include intermediaryA and intermediaryB receiving the 1% fee. <br><br>Can you tell me what the process / steps are for presenting this to the sponsors of the project? <br>1. Should we give the Engagement Letter to the broker to give to the sponsors or should we give it directly to the sponsors? <br>2. Once the letter is signed by the sponsors, does a copy of it need to go to the lender prior to the lender presenting an LOI?<br><br>I noticed in the sponsors&#39; cost breakdown of the project where they included a Broker Fee of 1% and a Lender Fee of 1%.<br>1. Do we need to ask some questions regarding fees to see who is getting what?<br>2. Knowing these two fees are already accounted for in the project costs, do we need to present our Engagement Letter any differently?<br><br>If I email you my changes to the Engagement Letter, can you scan over it to make sure it looks good? <br><br>Thank you!<br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>According to the FDIC website, a bank I called has 18.4mm SFR &amp; 23.2mm CRE in OREO; 4.5mm SFR (30-89 Days); 7.8mm SFR in Non-Accrual.  The female I spoke to in special assets said they don&#39;t sell their assets at a discount and proceeded to give me their website that has their properties for sale.  The person I wanted to speak to was on the phone when I called.  However, I did send him an email.  How would you proceed with finding out their current stance on selling their non-performing product?  I did not get a reply to my email.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I&#39;m working on getting tapes.  My question comes from the FDIC website and more specifically from the &quot;Past Due and Nonaccrual Assets&quot; page. Sometimes it will show the dollar amount for each of the categories below:<br> - Secured by 1-4 family residential properties<br> - Secured by multifamily residential properties<br> - Secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties<br><br>I know you are interested in the SFR.  I was curious if you are interested in the nonfarm nonresidential properties and also what that actually included.

          Sal,<br><br>Can you give me some guidance on how I should position myself to make a profit on deals that are outside of Dandrew’s wheelhouse?  I found another funding source that has interest in the deals I previously presented to Dandrew.  The deals came to me from a private money lender who said the deals are outside of their fund’s capabilities.  As it stands, I am sitting in the middle with the private money lender on one side who is direct with the sponsor and I’m sure wants a fee from the deal.  On the other side, I have the funding source who appears to be an individual who would broker the loan and also wants a fee.  This is part of what he sent me in an email (“As a broker, I normally get a 1.5% fee for placing these loans, and would need either a direct fee agreement, or a co-broker agreement with you in order to move forward. Please let me know how you&#39;s like to approach this.”)<br><br>What fee should I seek to get, and should I try to get a profit stake in any of the deals?  I’ve never done this before, and I’m not quite clear as to what agreements I should get signed from either side or what that agreement should say.  I know Dandrew has agreements we can use, and I believe I have downloaded them.  What do I need to do to make sure I don’t get circumvented?  Do I need to construct a co-broker agreement with the private money person and also a separate one with the funding source?  Can you be as detailed as possible and give me some guidance on exactly what agreements to use and the minimal language it must have so I don’t get screwed?  I’ve added one of the deals below as an example of what I’m working with. <br><br>Three sites are in various stages of entitlement. Two in Marin, one in Colma (south of San Francisco). Both are very high demand markets. They need $500k to $800k in JV Equity (I presume) to finish the entitlement process, and $6mm acquisition loan once entitlements are awarded and sites value goes up to $14mm. <br>• Borrower: Developer may step down leaving the planning group and Investors to take control. JV Equity partner can take control. <br>• JV Equity: $500k to $800k depending on cost of extensions.<br>• Acquisition financing: $6mm based on entitled value of $14mm<br>• Exit strategy: flip to builder or partner to develop<br><br>Thank you.<br>Bill<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>My question is how do I profit from being in the middle with another funding source other than Dandrew?  Is it no difference than my position with Dandrew?  Should I just work with the funding source on my fee amount or do I try to get at fee from both sides?  What is customary 1%, 1.5%, 2.0%?  I&#39;m not coming from 20 years of experience of putting commercial deals together.  I&#39;m coming from zero years of putting commercial deals together.  My knowledge is limited to the training resources of Dandrew.  I haven&#39;t experienced a real world deal yet.  Do I simply need to use the Engagement Letter with the funding source to specify my fee in the deal?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Sorry to keep harping on this, but I don&#39;t want to screw up just getting out of the starting gate.  It would be nice if the Engagement Letter was marked up to show where we need to add, replace, remove language to accommodate our specific deal.  I noticed on Page 2, Paragraph 5, it mentions how the fee should be paid out in reference to a condo sale and acquiring takeout financing.  Obviously, I don&#39;t need any reference to a condo sale in my agreement.  How much language can I remove from this document and yet keep it applicable to my deal?  I see where I can replace the reference to Dandrew with my company name and replace the reference to Signature Community Group with the borrower&#39;s name.  What else can I remove or change so it doesn&#39;t look like I copied a document from another deal?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Does this look like something that will interest you?  They are developing a retail shopping center close to Austin, TX.  Target will be the main anchor tenant and Chick-fil-A was also mentioned as another tenant.  Text below comes from my contact.<br><br>&quot;I should have asked: do you guys do commercial bridge loans? We&#39;ve got an 80 acre parcel on deck with 1300 foot of road front off 290 within 20 minutes of downtown Austin. We&#39;re going to put pads in by road. We&#39;ll get leases in hand from commercial tenants and use their deposits to help our deal structure right. That is just a short intro to the case. Talk more soon.&quot;<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Bill        </p>

          Bridge and equity lenders right now are not doing commercial ground up development (raw land) right now. No one is. The market has gotten a little spooked. <br><br>However, a local commercial bank should be shown this as they can do a mini-perm to perm loan. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Does this interest you at all?<br><br>&quot;Seeking equity partner or straight up investor for $4M. Complete construction of an assisted living facility (ALF) with 72 villas - 14 of which have been completed and are fully occupied and a waiting list of 50 for the villas, an important component of the EB-5 Program. Equity Investor would receive a guaranteed return on investment (ROI) of 8% for 5 years and thereafter would share in the profits at the rate of 30%.

          Sal,<br><br>Has your stance on development changed? I had a HML guy from Arizona ask me the question below:<br>&quot;Do you provide loans for large development projects namely hotels and large multi-family complexes? What are your best rates for these?&quot;<br><br>After searching through previous comments on Askdandrew.com, I&#39;m a bit confused on the whole development idea. On one hand, I see where you say no ground up development gets funded, but then again, Land Development is considered if we are a Land Financier. As a Private Equiteer, where do I fit in in regards to new hotel and multi-family projects, and will they be funded from the ground up stage or will they only get funded if they are in distress?<br><br>Also, have you seen my POF request from the Helpdesk?<br><br>Thank you!<br>Bill        </p>

          Bill<br><br>Land Development Financier was developed to capitalized on assets that had been *partially* developed but the developer ran out of money. Or his revolvers got pulled. That was an opportunity as we were able to fund the development of these projects from the point of being “less risky” in the Land Development Continuum. <br><br>The ground up stuff is still pretty risky. I’ve heard today on the street that Regions is pulling their revolvers from some developers. So this could get interesting. <br><br>*Just because the hard money lender is getting requests doesn’t mean that he knows how to qualify these deals. As a Private Equiteer – and assuming you actually went through the materials – you know more than he does. Right?*  <br><br>Regarding Land Development Financier, that is a separate, standalone system that is *not* part of Private Equiteer. You will have to buy that separately. What you have is the porterhouse. But if you want mashed potatoes that is extra. <br><br>Lastly, I approved your POF so you should see that soon in your inbox. <br><br>Thanks, <br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Believe me, I wasn&#39;t overly impressed. Only when someone&#39;s actions &quot;start&quot; to backup what they say or write do I &quot;start&quot; to become impressed.

          Sal,<br><br>I am a Private Equiteer. I purchased the private banker identity kit and have my website up. I purchased the LinkedIn Leaders and have my profile up with 261 connections now. What &quot;side items&quot;, as you say, do I need to be able to submit qualified deals to you? For the DIP Financing, I realize now I need to have that side item in order to be knowledgeable in that area when speaking with lawyers. Are there other side items I need for submitting deals when working with Bulk REOs, NPNs, etc.? <br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Is it absolutely necessary that we create our LLC in Nevada? I can create one in my home state for $50.

          Hello, Sal<br><br>Through my search for deal flow, I came across 2 projects looking for construction funding.<br>At this current time, does Dandrew do new construction funding?<br>If not then, maybe you could suggest another funder who might have an interest? <br>Or would any other Dandrew students have an interest in this?<br><br>(2)  The 2nd project is for a multi-family development in a major city in the Southeast<br>Total project cost of $70.2M. Construction financing needed is approximately $56.2M. <br><br>My contact informed me that &quot;This is a shovel-ready project.

Entire 35.1 acre parcel has an estimated value of $110M – $120M since entitlements, zoning, and approvals completed. Land is owned free and clear by the client.<br><br>This site will eventually have over 542,000 square feet of office &amp; retail, and 200 plus room hotel<br>Quote from project documents : The strong economy and high occupancy of this city&#39;s apartment community will allow for absorption of 20 – 22 units per month and stabilized occupancy in the market is above 94%.<br><br>Here are some other relevant details:<br>Construction Period: 14-18 months<br>Debt service coverage of 1.26 by end year 1 inclusive of estimated reserves. <br>64% LTV by end of year 1.<br>Debt yield of 9.52%.<br>Gross profit margin 20%.<br>Estimated residual value of land is conservative given this is Phase 1 of a seven phase mixed use development encompassing all 36 acres of the project with a total project cost of $425 million.<br>Sponsor has considerable net worth.<br><br>From my contact,  I have received documents with specific details and figures <br>(executive summary, lender analysis, and a client-prepared project summary)<br><br>Would Dandrew or anyone else in your network, be interested in this? <br>If yes, what are some followup questions or information that you want me to find out from my contact? <br>What other kinds of specific details do you need to know about this project? <br><br>Thanks<br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Going back to 1997 I&#39;ve done IT work.  From 2006-2013, I worked for the FBI doing IT work.  For the past couple of years, I&#39;ve been wholesaling and rehabbing SFR&#39;s.<br><br>DIP: I don&#39;t have the DIP Financier.  I thought I was doing well when I paid the full price for the Private Equiteer System.  Does this mean I can&#39;t submit anything for DIP Financing if I don&#39;t have the DIP Financier System?<br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Bill<br><br>The Private Equiteer affords you many and several privilidges, its like ordering a porterhouse steak. <br><br>However, the DIP Financier is like a side item. This is a very specialized part of real estate finance that you need to understand thoroughly. We need you to speak the same language as us *and the lawyers you will face off with will demand that you do.*<br><br>Also, I would add your work experience in there as well. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Do you have any advice for getting started making connections with our LinkdedIn profile?  I&#39;m sitting at zero for the moment.  I purchased the LinkedIn Leaders, and used it to create my profile.  Right now, I&#39;m waiting for approval from the various groups I requested to join.  This seems to take a long time.  They apparently don&#39;t get in a hurry to approve requests.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Bill        </p>
