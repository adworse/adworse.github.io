          Sal,<br><br>I just acquired DIP Financier and have a question for you that relates to something you responded to Richard about 3 months ago.  But first, your comments to Richard:<br><br><br>&quot;Richard: <br><br> Because you’re a nice guy, and I have a fetish for DIP loans, I’ve contracted one of our financial writers in NYC to put together a kit for you and all of the other DIP Financiers. <br><br> Frankly, this has been a long-time coming, but I have conviction that the next wave of BKs will start to flow shortly. <br><br>NOTE: This will only be available for current DIP Financiers. <br><br> Give me a week at best, 2 at worst. <br><br> Your Pal, <br> Sal<br> <br>Salvatore Buscemi commented 3 months ago&quot;<br><br>My question:  has this kit been put together as yet, and if so, where do I find it?  Is it in the DIP Financier I just purchased?  I am likely going to go after DIP/BK as I feel this is a really good place for me to start.  Looking forward to your reply, and thanks.<br><br>Michele        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I realize this video was created several years ago, so the &quot;Hard Money Lender List&quot; to which you refer may be (probably is) &#39;out of date&#39; or invalid at this point.  However, if not, is the list still available and if so where would I find it?  I looked in both Bonus Materials and Resources and the list is not there, or at least I could not identify it in either of those files.<br><br>On the other hand, you mentioned that you did some research to create that list.  I would not mind doing my own research to create a list today.  Can you suggest research criteria that I could use to create my own list?  <br><br>Thanks again.<br><br>Michele        </p>

          Michele:<br><br>Go to AAPLOnline.com. There is a list of all the current members on there and I believe they have to pay dues to list there. <br><br>If they are not paying dues, they probably aren&#39;t real or doing enough business to justify paying to put their name in there. <br><br>Many Dandrew I&#39;maries have found great opportunities there.

          At the end you mention what could happen if either the Mezz or the 1st TD had to FC.  In the scenario of the 1st FCing, it would wipe out the Mezz.  In the scenario of the Mezz FCing, they take over the 1st, subject to.  Okay, here&#39;s my question:  In the case of the A/B loan and the A (senior) is sold separately, and there is FC, what happens to the B portion of the loan???  I hope I phrased that correctly.        </p>

          Michele<br><br>Great question!!! It follows what is in the Intercreditor Agreement, and usually, even though these loans are sliced behind closed doors, usually what happens is the A/B portion is still wrapped under the umbrella of &quot;debt&quot; in the Intercreditor Agreement. <br><br>Now, *the mezz financing 99.9% of the time is originated at the same time as the first trust debt or senior debt.* So what happens to that debt as far as it being split is usually not consequential to the mezz holder as that happens *after* the loan / cap stack is originated. <br><br>Debt is debt and it has its own set of remedies. So if the A forecloses, so does the B by default. <br><br>Your pal,<br>Sal<br><br>*PS I better see you in Vegas*. You seem to really like this stuff. And I&#39;m doing a lot of pushups here answering your questions...         </p>

          Thanks for noticing and your &#39;muscles&#39; are showing!!!  I do love this &quot;product&quot; (capital) and am getting ready to start my quest.  The learning curve is REALLY!!!!!! steep and am a bit overwhelmed (to put it mildly). This isn&#39;t just a few new words, it is a completely new language, thought process and culture.   Can&#39;t make LV and am bummed about that.  I would love to meet you f2f.  Hopefully, some other time.        </p>

          Haven&#39;t read the manual yet but the audio is great!  However, you mention both Thomas-Law and Scotsmanguide in the audio as good sources of leads, and neither seem to have the type of detailed lists you mention in the audio.  Was this audio done a while ago?        </p>

          I did ask this question of the Help Desk (as I said I would) and they are sending me back to you.  The reason I asked the question in the first place is because you told Suzette (about a month or so ago) not to use the agreement (Broker Loan Agreement)  in the pdf attachment to this file. You had told her to use the Agreement to be found in the Resources file.  It is NOT in the Resources file (only Excel files in there), so I am wondering where I would find the correct Banker Loan Agreement you recommend using.<br><br>Thanks, and I await your reply.  <br><br>Michele        </p>

          Michele, <br><br>This is what you say in bold. And *never* lift up your skirt and tell them who your funding source is. Otherwise they will circumvent you: <br><br>*I&#39;m an Intermediary for a private, boutique commercial investment bank who&#39;s invests in capital structure in commercial real estate deals that require funding. Sometimes we&#39;re debt, sometimes we&#39;re equity, and our most popular structured product today is preferred equity. We&#39;re pretty much agnostic to asset classes, except for raw land. With that said, do you have any funding scenarios that you&#39;d like to discuss?*<br><br>then let them talk. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Yes, that is true. However, without being offensive, do you realize that I don&#39;t even know what structured product means - not to mention preferred equity. I understand what a bridge loan is. THAT one seems elementary. But most of the rest of this I&#39;m struggling with because the training doesn&#39;t seem (to me - one without any CRE or CRE lending knowledge) to start off with an explanation of the different lending products and processes and such.<br><br>Maybe this program is for people who already know all that stuff. It never states anywhere that you need to know that, so I just assumed that the basics would be taught from the ground up. That why I&#39;m always asking so many questions...because there seems to be pieces to the puzzle missing. I go through the material and gain the info. So,  I&#39;m just hoping that by the end of module six it all comes full circle and gels together.<br><br>Again, I do not mean to be offensive. I&#39;m coming from a certain knowledge base and you guys are looking at it as already having been players on Wall Street, college attendees, CRE businessmen and such. So maybe that&#39;s why you&#39;re uncertain as to exactly what needs to be taught.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>At (approx.) 8:01 into the video, you say &quot;Has &#39;borrower&#39; issued a notice of default yet&quot;.  I believe you mis-spoke here because I think you meant &#39;lender&#39;, but that caused me to think of a more important point, and raised another question for me.<br><br>I have noticed throughout these trainings that the terms &quot;Buyer&quot; and &quot;Seller&quot; (as well as Lender/Borrower) are many times interchanged.  If this is correct (that the terms are indeed interchangeable), is there a list somewhere that I can see how and where the terms would be reversed, i.e., where the &quot;buyer&quot; becomes the &quot;seller&quot; and/or the &quot;seller&quot; becomes the &quot;buyer&quot; etc?<br><br>I am confused when these terms have been interchanged and am hoping your reply can clarify this for me.  <br><br>Thanks and I look forward to your reply.<br><br>Michele        </p>

          Am I correct in my comments about the terms (Buyer, Seller, Borrower, Lender, etc, etc, etc,) being &#39;interchanged&#39;, or is it just me???  And sometimes when you refer to &quot;borrower&quot;, I am uncertain &#39;which&#39; borrower you mean.  For example, are you referring to the &#39;original&#39; borrower whose name is on the note or do you mean the new borrower who is looking to purchase the note and have Dandrew finance the purchase?  I admit, I am confused.  Any clarification you can provide will be GREATLY!!! appreciated.  Thanks again.        </p>

          Michele, <br><br>Great question. <br><br>The lenders may appoint a receiver, depending on how the loan docs read. Early in any judicial foreclosure action, the lender that brought the action will often ask the court to appoint a receiver to take control of the property away from the borrower. Appointment of a receiver represents a crucial step in the foreclosure process. The receivership is also intended to assure that the property does not deteriorate under the control of a distracted and penniless borrower.<br><br>Does this answer your question? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Yes it does. and many thanks.  Very interesting, indeed. So, if I understand you correctly, you are indicating that the lender has begun the FC process (the operative word here is &#39;begun&#39;), I assume with a NOD, which would be recorded.  Does the recorded NOD trigger a court appearance, hence the appointment of a receiver?        </p>

          So it is not the BK that triggers the receiver, it is the beginning of the FC process (NOD) by the lender that would trigger the receiver.  Got it (I think :-)).  Thanks again.  Michele        </p>

          I have 2 questions:<br><br>1.  In the &quot;Borrower&quot; area you reference the range of terms, which appear to be current (May, 2014), but above in the &quot;Five Data Points&quot; area you reference &#39;2010 actuals&#39;.  Are those terms in &quot;Borrower&quot; current?<br><br>2.  Again in &quot;Borrower&quot;, re reference &#39;DSCR&#39; (Debt Service Coverage Ratio). My question is:  is there going to be a training on how DSCR is calculated, and if so, where and when will I find it?  <br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Michele        </p>

          Michele<br><br>The borrower terms are current.

          In the inforgrphic at the end, you use as an example a bank with only $89,000 of SFR REO.  My question is what is the minimum amount of $ of REO that Dandrew would be interested in buying?        </p>

          $2 million is what I thought was the minimum.  So why would I call on a bank with less (in some cases substantially less than $1 million as in the example you used in the FDIC infographic - $89,000) in REO loans/properties?<br><br>Also, at the FDIC site and in the report that is generated, there is a link to &quot;Past due and nonaccrual assets&quot;.

          About 2 months ago you said you were in the process of preparing some scripts that would cover the POF issue.  Have these scripts been made available, and if so, where on Ask Dandrew have they been posted?  And I repeat from earlier comments I have posted here:  my &quot;Resources&quot; tab only contains 2 Excel spreadsheets, and nothing else. (Should my Resources file contain something other than the 2 Excel spreadsheets?)  I say this because you, Sal, have sent me to Resources on more than one occasion.  Or are of these questions for the Help Desk?        </p>

          Michele, <br><br>These scrips are being finalized. And so is the POF which we will be releasing shortly again soon. <br><br>And I&#39;ve actually have gone into the documents library to send to DandrewHelpDesk.com the agreements - that no one else had a problem finding in the past 3 years... - so they can send them to you. <br><br>By now, you should have received them. If you haven&#39;t, contact the DandrewHelpDesk if they aren&#39;t in your Inbox by tomorrow AM. <br><br>And I do see *everything* the DandrewHelpDesk.com responds to. I pay a fortune in support services alone for our Intermediaries. <br><br>That is not profit to us: this amounts to the equivalent of pushing a nice German car off of a cliff each year. Every year. <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Just to be completely clear, this mall is open and operating. It is not dark. The credit and non-credit tenants listed were taken from the current rent roll.        </p>

          Jack<br><br>We&#39;ve seen a lot of our smaller, less experienced competitors get caught holding assets where the leasees have gone dark or are planning to. <br><br>Keep in mind, most developers don’t really know the general financial condition of their tenants.

          Read both of the articles and listened again to AJ&#39;s pitch.  One of the points made by the audience was that real estate investing is local.  One question was the impact online retailers such as Amazon would have on brick and mortar stores.  Another was the effect that market cycles would have on retailers.<br><br>Regarding real estate investing being local, I contacted Tyler Young - Ardmore Development Authority to get the latest information.  Here is Tyler&#39;s response to my question.<br><br> &quot;The most accurate information I can give you on the current unemployment rate for Carter County is 3.1% as of April 2014, which was a 0.8% decrease from March. Also, Ardmore’s median Household income is $38,383 according to the US Census Bureau’s information. As for your question about the impact of the developments in the oil and gas business, as you can tell by the unemployment rating, Ardmore has certainly benefited from the advances in the industry. In addition, Ardmore has seen record highs in retail sales and building permits which can also be tied to the various developments in the energy fields. I hope this answer was helpful to you, was there anything else I could do for you? If so, please do not hesitate to ask.&quot;  <br><br>Circuit City was Ardmore&#39;s largest employer when they went out of business and it hurt Ardmore.  But as you can see from the current unemployment rate, this has been absorbed.  Michelin is another large local employer and they are expanding their manufacturing capability.<br><br>Probably the largest contributor to Ardmore&#39;s current economic/unemployment picture is the oil and gas industry and the expanding production.  The oil patch is not something that can be shut down and moved to China.<br><br>The growth in the nation&#39;s economy, such as it is, can be traced almost entirely to the energy sector.  <br><br>I am not sure what stronger economic indicators you would want in a city/region.<br><br>Regarding everyone buying everything online.  While high tech/office workers in larger cities may buy a lot/most things online, like AJ said, that is not the demographic here.  People in this demographic, while they shop online, shop locally and the teenagers use shopping as a social outing.<br><br>With the energy sector being the only bright spot on the economic horizon, that I see, I think the future of retailers in this market is much brighter than in markets that are dependent on pushing paper and not oil. <br>        </p>

          Jack, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in Oklahoma. I like Ardmore. The largest employers in Ardmore are the Michelin Tire Plant, Dollar General Stores, Valero Energy which owns Valero Gas and C Store retailers and a few others and I believe this is why the unemployment rate has decreased. Also you have to factor in Winstar Casino, which currently employs 2300 people in many capacities.<br><br>You and I are both in DFW, you and I both know that when the energy business is booming, everything gets on a rise economically, money is in it&#39;s pleasure mode, new jobs arrive, etc.<br><br>When the energy business declines, most towns end up like Big Springs, Texas. Depressed, money is screaming bloody murder, times are bad.<br><br>The one problem with shopping malls is the online presence of many retailers. Many retailers close stores and evolve into having a huge Amazon like presence which kills mall leases. It&#39;s not easy to fill spaces. Mall owners are not going to reduce rental rates just to get someone in, unless there is a rent escalation that can be favorable at some point.<br><br>In NY, NJ, CT and PA, some mall owners will actually create rent concessions because there are other lease incentives involved that make a rent concession better for the owners.<br><br>While I cannot speak for Sal or Dandrew, I am thinking that if this mall was like a North Park or a Galleria or even Parks Mall in Arlington, they would be able to go to committee and justify giving a $3M funding. <br><br>The risk in this deal is obvious, not many national retailers are going to be beating down the doors to Ardmore OK to become tenants of this mall. If the current tenants decide they&#39;ve had enough of retail, they will leave one by one.<br><br>Case in point, a Irving Mall in Irving, Texas. If it weren&#39;t for Burlington Coat Factory, the mall would slowly die a sudden and justified death. Shoppers World will never bring continued traffic to that mall.        </p>

          If I am the sales manager for a &#39;national retailer&#39; then I am going to know who my customers are and where they live. If my customers shop on 5th Avenue or Rodeo Drive, then I know that they are not a significant portion of Ardmore.  If my customers are the working class then they are in Ardmore.  <br><br>My job as a sales manager is to put my outlets in locations where sales will be made. Am I going to look in NY, NJ, CT or PA for locations where the local economy has a 3.1% unemployment rate and a household income of $38,383? Think I could look long and hard and not find those conditions in those states.<br><br>My research department is going to tell me where my customers are and what the economic conditions are in those areas.  If the economy is based on one major company, then that area is not as attractive. If on the other hand the economy is underpinned by a diverse business/manufacturing base and the resurgence of the oil and gas production brought about by new technology that has brought new life and production levels never before seen in the oil patch, then this is going to be a place that I am interested in. I don&#39;t think that anyone thinks the increased oil and gas production is only going to last a year or so.<br><br>One of the credit tenants in this mall that has 9 years left on a 10 year lease has just been relocated to a more prominent 15,000 sq ft location and Ulta Cosmetics will be occupying a new 10,000 location which will add $210,000 to the NOI.  The owners of this mall have recently sold another mall in Ardmore at a 7% cap rate. Not exactly a fire sale.<br><br>Regarding online sales replacing retail outlets.  Like AJ said in his presentation, the demographics of this area are not the ones who buy the majority of their things online.  They are computer literate but still go to retail stores to buy what they want now. If I am looking for a &#39;big ticket item&#39; and do not need it today, then online is definitely a viable option. If I am looking for some sports gear to use this weekend or my wife is looking for cosmetics then we are shopping locally.<br><br>Regarding the Irving Mall, the changing demographics around a mall can kill it.  You could also say the same thing about the former Red Bird Mall, now Southwest Mall, in Duncanville, TX. The customer base for these malls moved. These malls then had to replace the old tenants with ones whose target customers are the ones who filled in for the former customers.<br><br>Regarding rent concessions. Rent concessions are part of life for any property that leases space, be it retail, office, multi-family, or states offering Tax Incentives to companies to get them to locate there.  Look at the current ads running on TV for NY offering 10 years tax free for locating there.<br><br>All investing involves risk.  Even not investing is risky, ever heard of inflation?  Lowest perceived risk would be Treasury&#39;s (although some could argue that this could be the riskiest of all), gold or silver (but how much control do you have on what happens there), the stock market (does anyone really believe that this is not a bubble) or real estate backed that are income producing.          </p>

          A couple of additional comments. If this mall was like a North Park or Galleria, both high end Dallas malls, I don&#39;t think that I could recommend it because the customers/demographics of their customer base is well above the $38,383 of the median Ardmore household income.  Again, you have to know who your customers are and what they buy.         </p>

          Jack,<br>I used the NY, NJ, PA markets as a point of conversation because I am a New Yorker but am here in Dallas the past twenty years. I know those markets well.<br><br>My reply to you was not for the purpose of gaining such a terse reply by you. The situation with any mall, anywhere is that you are subject to the financial conditions of the shopping public.<br><br>Just as many low wage income earners shop at high dollar malls as do wealthy individuals. Galleria Mall in Dallas has just as many used vehicles in the lot as there are Bentleys. <br><br>Shopping choices come down to people&#39;s desires more often than cost to acquire. If I were funding this deal which obviously I&#39;m not but I probably have a funder for this deal, here is how I would be viewing this.<br><br>1. I would be looking at the population of Ardmore, Oklahoma to gain a full understanding of the demographic and the median income, which is $38,000.<br><br>2. The borrower is investing $5M dollars to update a mall that still has the income of shoppers at $38K per year.<br><br>3. Where is this $5M number in the capital stack??? Are they taking debt on or is this from their own resources?<br><br>4. What is the NOI for this mall? can it fully support the capital stack<br><br>5. What happens to this mall if a developer decides to come in and build a super regional mall between Ardmore and OKC with big name national tenants who have zero issue with being out in the middle of no where and what happens. <br><br>6. What happens if a developer comes in and builds a master planned community and drives this traffic away, what happens to the ability of this ownership to support debt?<br><br>And Jack, not all National Sales Managers are bright enough to really understand markets their stores are located in. There have been many NSM&#39;s who kept a store open longer than they should have, causing a chain to go up in smoke.<br><br>Sometimes it&#39;s not always the obvious that causes a deal to go south.        </p>

          I did not mean for my reply to be terse.  My point is that the product you are selling must be aligned with the wants, needs and ability of your target customer.  I spent about 40 years in technical sales to aerospace and defense. I learned the first day that I had to identify who had a need for and could use my product.  That is the point I was making.<br><br>Shopping malls have a pull radius for the majority of their customers and while there are &#39;used&#39; cars in the parking lot of the Galleria, there are many stores there that cater to the 6 or 7 figure income shopper.  As far as &#39;shopping choices coming down to desires more often than cost to acquire&#39; I am sure that the customer who drives the 2009 Ford would rather have the 2014 S500, but then reality sets in.<br><br>All of the financials were supplied to Dandrew and yes the $5mm for renovations is in the capital stack. The NOI will support a sale at a 7% cap of $20mm+. The owners of this mall have sold another mall in Ardmore in the last 4 months at a 7 cap.<br><br>As far as a developer building a super regional mall between Ardmore and OK City would be extremely as there is not enough population density to support it.  The same could be said of a master planned community. <br><br>But then, what would happen to the cost of gold if the Alchemists finally succeed?<br><br>        </p>

          Jack<br><br>It took me about 30 mins to craft this response. Here it is. <br><br>The consumer here is a low skilled, low income wage earner who&#39;s salary and discretionary spending is increasingly restricted. <br><br>This has nothing to do with &quot;selling a product&quot;. Investors don&#39;t care about that. They see the bifurcation of the middle class into the wealthy and the poor. No middle ground. It&#39;s well known that a major reason why the middle class is in decline is the *stagnation of wages*. <br><br>While it is true that going to the mall is a fun experience for some, and a way to pass time for the seniors, that does not translate into sales to generate the profits to retailers to maintain large, expensive stores. It is highly likely that the shift to stores becoming more like showrooms, and therefore taking less space, is going to accelerate. With the logistics of next day shipping now becoming highly efficient, stores no longer need to have the space formerly required for inventory storage. Amazon and others have perfected warehouse to residential front door delivery to a science and that means less space by bricks and mortar retail. It does mean more warehouse space easily accessible to major highways and rail in urban areas. It will get harder over time to find larger tenants who need the same space they once had. *Retail as a whole remains overcapacitied.*<br><br>Many of the retail employees are lower wage people and they will be caught up in the Obamacare nightmare of what to do about insurance. The issues for large retailers is their cost of healthcare is going to rise as the requirements of what has to be covered in a policy hit premiums, and so labor costs for the retailer will rise. If you accept that online shopping is going to impact space needs and usage, and you combine it with the cost issue of labor, then you will see that paying higher rents is a problem. Lastly, as we just saw this past Christmas, retail didn’t have a promising start. Sales were down, discounting was rampant and profits at retailers were squeezed *badly*. <br><br>What we care about is the health of the company later. JCP is struggling. Badly. So are some of the other middle-class consumer staples. I know you think that these brands will be here forever, but when the Affordable Healthcare Act expenses erode spending, coupled with more people on government assistance programs than there are productive workers, and credit being constricted, this is what the death spiral for these malls is. Sears is no different, Lampert didn’t do what everyone thought he would do with this. <br><br>*You’re confused when you mention AJs fund*. That is for grocery-anchored retail (aka *”broadline retial*”). No consumer discretionary staples. <br><br>These stores serve a sedentary population, who use their EBT cards for these foodstuffs and is not seen in most ways competing with Amazon. <br><br>So Jack, knowing what you know now, would you invest your life savings into this deal?  <br><br>Just a yes or no is required from your gut here. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Not to beat a dead horse but retail capacity that is excess in one location can not be loaded on a truck and taken to another area where it is needed.  <br><br>As far as low skilled workers vs high skilled workers, the worker who has skills that are in demand by the market is the one who has a job.  I have watched engineers with PHDs driving taxi cabs and swearing that they only had a high school education.  I have seen engineers with MS not be hired because the employer only needed someone with a BS and the employer knew that when times got better, the MS would move on. There are jobs available if someone is willing to develop the skills needed and move to where the jobs are.<br><br>That being said, the class of real estate that I see as being in danger of going dark before retail are office buildings.  There are several large complexes here in Dallas that are very dim or dark and Dallas is definitely not Detroit.  With today&#39;s technology, other than the ego, why do most companies need large or small offices in an office building?  All that is needed is a phone and internet connection.  For those times when a personal meeting is needed or video conferencing, then rent the time from a hot chair company that rent by the hour. <br><br>Banks also fall into that category.  I do virtually all of my bill paying on line and bank transactions at the ATM. <br><br>So I get back to my original question which is: With all of the negative doom and gloom and the sky is falling, what should I be looking for?        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>To answer your question about whether or not I would invest in this if I had the funds.  I come from this demographic and have lived long enough to have gone through several ups and downs in the economy.  Are changes coming, definitely. Will it happen in the next year or so, don&#39;t think so.  It is tempting to look at the broad brush predictions about over capacity and retail going dark without looking at where the over capacity is.  How much retail &#39;over&#39; capacity is in Detroit or Gary, IN or other places where whole industries have moved out?<br><br>Regarding low skill vs high skill.  I supported a wife and two sons on a basic skill I learned in high school.  This skill allowed me to eventually start my own company.  I finally went back to college to get my B.S. in Marketing (I have a B.S in BS). It only took me 34 years to complete, not because I needed it but because I wanted it.  My point is that having a skill that is needed in the market is the key, not that you have a PHD in Navajo basket weaving and then complain that you can not find a job.<br><br>If I had to make a choice between investing in real estate in Ardmore, OK with a 3.1% unemployment rate that is declining and a household income that is 140% of the national median income with the oil patch going like crazy or a small town in the mid-west where all of the citizens are on welfare and use their EBT cards to buy all of their needs, then I will chose Ardmore.        </p>

          Jack<br><br>First, I’ll respond, however, I’m not obligated to. You’ve been a member for a while, I like and respect you (no matter what you think of me…) so I’ll answer this. I know you’re active and I support the active people with a passion.  These take a long time to craft carefully and sometimes I have to have AJ review it so it doesn’t sound so terse and give other Intermediaries the bad impression. <br><br>My goal here is to make everyone *think*. That is why I crafted this response. There are some folks here reading this who have a few million in the bank and may do something with it that could get them wiped out. <br><br>*1. Regarding AJ’s Deal:* I appreciate what you are saying about AJs deal; however you’re talking about 2 different narrow niches here. <br><br>Comparing this to AJs fund which is really narrow is not what we’re doing here. But I have to say that AJ’s tenants for his deal are seen as being much stronger than most credits (aka “credit tenants”) on your deals rent roll because they are owned by a very big private equity firm that has a very strong balance sheet. <br><br>Also, since this idea has been conceived, larger private equity players have come in and have done something similar in this space. <br><br>And if the feedback from AJ’s pitch (soon to be released as a Continuing Ed) to a group of very, very wealthy family offices is any indication, it’s a winning idea. That is the smart money.  <br><br>(If people buy HUD housing because they want the stable monthly checks from the government, why should it be any different for EBT and food stamps?)<br><br>*1. Regarding your deal:* We’re talking about having Dandrew provide debt and equity to a developer who is looking to convert an old smaller, concert hall into a shopping area. To use this he is cross collateralizing a mall he is developing in Ardmore, OK that has some tenants who are getting hit. <br><br>These tenants, regardless of the micro, Ardmore-based unemployment rate are subjected to the same <br>market forces. JC Penney is not seen as a “credit tenant”. The middle class is getting squeezed more and more every day. <br><br>The American economy is *not* strong, no matter what anyone tells you on TV, and we’ve seen some colleagues recent get hurt in North Dakota in the oil business as well; its boom and bust and I think the fracking business is on its way out. Not now, but in 2 years it will be different. A lot of these deposits haven’t been as fruitful as once thought they were. But that is a different story altogether. <br><br>If your middle class in a job it’s downright awful; you’re losing money each year, there is no job security and that affects spending. It always has, and it always will. There may not be soup lines but the pain is probably even more acute today.  <br><br>If you own your own business, you are not subjected to the same wage compression, you’re future is seen as being more stable and you have more discretionary money to spend. <br><br>At the end of the day, what I’m telling you is that I’m not smarter than you or anyone else, just *much more experienced*. I get paid to look at these deals to insulate my investors and be a custodian for their money. They look to me to really dig in to see where the risks are. This deal is painted with more risk than what most capital providers would be comfortable with. I’m the jealous ex-boyfriend doing the best due diligence I can on these deals. That is why I manage so much. They know the last person anyone wants to question their due diligence is mine. Its why our staff and AJ has spent *2 years of his life in my office*, to learn this method of *thinking* like a jilted lover, metaphorically speaking. <br><br>And when AJ came in, he was the happy sap. Today he is just as happy, richer, but 100% less “sap”. Ask anyone who’s been with us for a while and they will tell you this. <br><br>*Honest financial research is a discipline. It requires us to not only understand the fundamentals, but to question the fundamentals. It requires us to look beyond what we would LIKE to see in the economy, and accept the reality of what is actually there.* That is how we structure our deals: *we simply attempt to structure the risk away from the deals* as we craft a solution to them. <br><br>To answer your question on what we have been working on in *retail* are “lifestyle” centers that have a higher end, clientele that have been booming for a while. For example one of these centers was a loan facing maturity default with leasees such as Williams Sonoma, Capitol Grill, a Talbots, Whole Foods and some others of equal caliber that I can’t remember off hand. This is based in CA. Regardless, if it were based in Dallas, it would still be attractive. <br><br>The fringe buyers on the lower end of the scale are facing extinction, hence I think that’s why you’ll see a lot of TGIFridays and Applebee’s start to get stressed. They will simply go to McDonalds, generally speaking. <br><br>*You need to learn to look at the numbers dispassionately.* We’re still in business and doing well because we considered ourselves to be more macro looking at these deals. Many people got into deals based on *emotion* and got killed. How do I know this? I raised $15mm around OFREEFund.com to manage this. <br><br>So at the end of the day, focus on defaulted note deals at a strong basis - that’s 60% of our business (and our colleagues too actually) and steer clear of these deals where there is more sizzle than steak. And you’ll get paid. <br><br>There are tons of these deals out there. But it requires everyone to be focused on what is going to close, not on what “should” close based on sentiment or emotion. <br><br>I could be wrong, but 12 year track record  on my own and a solid reputation as a risk manager tells me otherwise. <br><br>Still your pal, <br>Sal        </p>
