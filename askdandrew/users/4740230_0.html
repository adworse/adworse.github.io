          Sal,  Regarding Point #1 on the white board in video, you introduced yourself as a &quot;broker and principal&quot; (of Dandrew Partners).  Of course, I am a principal of my own company but I am not a broker, so how would I introduce myself?          </p>

          Michele, <br><br>This is what you say in bold. And *never* lift up your skirt and tell them who your funding source is. Otherwise they will circumvent you: <br><br>*I&#39;m an Intermediary for a private, boutique commercial investment bank who&#39;s invests in capital structure in commercial real estate deals that require funding. Sometimes we&#39;re debt, sometimes we&#39;re equity, and our most popular structured product today is preferred equity. We&#39;re pretty much agnostic to asset classes, except for raw land. With that said, do you have any funding scenarios that you&#39;d like to discuss?*<br><br>then let them talk. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Yes, that is true. However, without being offensive, do you realize that I don&#39;t even know what structured product means - not to mention preferred equity. I understand what a bridge loan is. THAT one seems elementary. But most of the rest of this I&#39;m struggling with because the training doesn&#39;t seem (to me - one without any CRE or CRE lending knowledge) to start off with an explanation of the different lending products and processes and such.<br><br>Maybe this program is for people who already know all that stuff. It never states anywhere that you need to know that, so I just assumed that the basics would be taught from the ground up. That why I&#39;m always asking so many questions...because there seems to be pieces to the puzzle missing. I go through the material and gain the info. So,  I&#39;m just hoping that by the end of module six it all comes full circle and gels together.<br><br>Again, I do not mean to be offensive. I&#39;m coming from a certain knowledge base and you guys are looking at it as already having been players on Wall Street, college attendees, CRE businessmen and such. So maybe that&#39;s why you&#39;re uncertain as to exactly what needs to be taught.        </p>

          OK never mind on POF,  through my charm and good looks I was able to get the un-sanitized tapes sent to me. Now I just need to re-watch ? hours of vids to remember how to qualify them. Unless of course you want me to just send them in? The best looking is a Pool of 43 Class-A and B performing resi UPB 7.4mm in TX, OH, PA, GA, IL...etc..Can make offer on pool or cherry pick. There are 2 more smaller pools of PN and NPN. and yes I&#39;m direct.<br><br>Also got a sponsor looking for a bridge loan on a solar farm backed by 7mm of land in S. Cali. right outside Edison. Seems unlikely to get funded but I thought I&#39;d ask?        </p>

           I sensed almost immediately that they were looking for future value today with zero guarantee of the projects success. This is what has happened in many parts of the country with broken developments, fractured condo developments. I did not hear anything about how the borrower was going to protect the funders and investors in the event the project went south. Too much risk on the front end with all the upside to be determined.        </p>

          There are plenty of good deals out there that don&#39;t require you to close your eyes, plug your nose and jump into the deep end. That&#39;s not the definition of a deal. Good work!        </p>

          I took away alot from this video. I took away from it that you must understand the matrix of the deal. You must understand the asset itself and the sponsor-operators plan for the deal. What do they plan to do with the asset. What is the story of the deal.        </p>

          Exactly. Its never just the asset, its the sponsor. Bad sponsors turn good deals into bad ones. Good sponsors turn good deals into bad ones. I know this from experience...        </p>

          One thing that I think is important to understand about what this lesson is dealing with is that either banks need what we have or they don&#39;t. It&#39;s not ever going to be a matter of let me think about it. They aren&#39;t buying a product off of Amazon. com. They may say we need to see additional information or we need to talk further with you, but it is always going to be either they need it or they don&#39;t        </p>

          Is the &quot;no&quot; signal the request for more information?  I haven&#39;t called banks yet so this video was right on the money for me.  Great job.  <br><br>James, <br>On your reply, do you mean you know right away if the people really need your service.  Any wishy washy stuff signals no interest.         </p>

          Let me reply in this way. If your calling The President of the Bank and you have used the FDIC tool Sal has provided, you already have an idea of the current or near current condition of the bank. The President will know that you are aware of this after you have spoken with them.<br><br>You have already raised their skirt. They have options which are to say no not interested which is really calling his/her fiduciary duty to the share holders and banks board to the mat, we could be interested but we need more information and we need to discuss this which is a prudent business practice or yes we have assets we would love to move off our balance sheet.<br><br>Keep this in mind and I think Sal and AJ have probably said this many times and will say it again, your dealing with the small banks. No one is lining up to call them and buy their assets.<br><br>This industry is littered with brokers and knuckle head Intermediaries well those who have self titled them as such that just do not have the same intellectual capital you, I and others here have, who have zero clue how to even locate these banks.<br><br>They all think you can just call up BofA or Wells Fargo and they will just open the door and say oh yes, we will show you what we have. They won&#39;t because they don&#39;t need us. The small guys need us and after you and they establish a relationship and you bring credible results, they will trust you.<br><br>Remember, it only takes one solid deal to close to make money and to potentially be written up in the Wall Street Journal and other publications, which is good for business.<br><br>Yes, they either need what we have or they don&#39;t, and in retrospect, they really can&#39;t get out from under where they are if it is not for us.        </p>

          I&#39;ve been calling banks and I find that if you come from the position of wanting to give them money as opposed to sell them something, you will get a better response.        </p>

          I agree he was full of great energy and excited to be there and it exuded that he is a guy you want to be working with.  He will answer calls and be glad to talk about our deal.  Perfect.  Did not come across as a first time for sure.  I humbly must say that it also made me feel like I could get present in that way as well.  Thanks to the knowledge we get from the big DM.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I know we are a commercial firm and I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of questions about buying Sfr&#39;s lately and most are saying they found a great deal but need a buyer and have no clue where to find one.<br><br>I have access to a software program, not that Freedom Soft junk that Preston Ely sells, that goes into the courthouse records and pulls date from all closed real estate transactions where the buyers paid cash.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking about putting together a program that gives access to this date for a monthly fee or per name charge. Any thoughts on this? I have tested this in my own area and have spoke with people on these lists and have assembled a war chest of real cash buyers who will buy deals as they come along.        </p>

          Sal,<br>This is something that new people can do to leverage themselves into commercial deal funding opportunities and I&#39;ve just tried it and I&#39;ve got a meeting today with a commercial real estate broker.<br><br>Call up a commercial broker, not a commercial realtor. The reason is a broker has more control over business decisions than a realtor who may need to get permission to branch out.<br><br>You partner with that commercial broker, setting it up as a joint venture. The broker brings the clients who need funding and the Dandrew Intermediary brings the money to the table.<br><br>All fees and yield spreads are split 50/50 after expenses. A Dandrew Intermediary can do this with as many Commercial Real Estate Brokers as they want since it&#39;s on a deal by deal basis.<br><br>The advantages are that the real estate broker is doing the marketing to source clients, is always networking, has access to the MLS, has an advanced level of knowledge, treats their business as a business, and most are well connected, which opens doors in the community.<br><br>The Dandrew Intermediary brings to the table, immense intellectual capital, access to monies through Dandrew, and if they are hungry and entrepreneurial, will have their business setup right.<br><br>I feel strongly that a intermediary needs to have a marketing plan that is geared toward the players in the business and not focused on the CrePigs, The Loopnets, The a Broker Outposts, all places which waste time and produce nothing tangible.<br><br>Just some thoughts.        </p>

          This is just a quick comment about showing your cards before you have the correct information from Sal and Dandrew. Never lift your skirt and make promises.<br><br>When you start discussing points, rates, terms you are possibly creating false expectations in the sponsor-operators mind ahead of what the terms of the deal are.<br><br>Go with the parameters Sal mentioned in the training videos and materials. You are not building false expectations this way.        </p>

          Sondra, I don&#39;t believe Sal would provide infographics and materials that any intermediaries could not leverage a position into. From experience, I&#39;ve come to determine that  there is way too much information on the market that talks about wholesaling residential properties.<br><br>Sal is the first to bring to market the concepts behind wholesaling commercial properties. The process for locating joint venture partners or buyers of properties in the commercial sector is the same as residential and it is going to be a somewhat simple process to get done because in commercial deals the profit potential is bigger.<br><br>One of the advantages of commercial over residential is that in commercial, your not dealing with properties that need sometimes extensive repairs and/ or code violations that need to be cured before your buyer can make the property marketable, which a prudent investor buyer is going to factor in when he/she considers your residential deal.<br><br>In commercial the selling factor for a buyer doing your deal is NOI and a strong NOI will always be attractive. I believe that if someone wants to be successful in this business, they will focus more on the end result and not on what if scenarios.        </p>

          Let me apologize if I upset you, I will revamp the question and ask it a better way. I have been putting together an idea to work with those commercial lending firms who once operated under the business model of being a direct lender and have clients searching for money for their deals.<br><br>They have done the heavy lifting in terms of marketing and verifying that a deal is valud and we meaning myself and Dandrew come in and take the deal and bring it to closing. Points are split 50/50 we get the equity kicker plus first right of refusal for twelve months on any subsequent funding opportunities with the borrower.<br><br>How would I put together a deal like this.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Good day to you. Yes I am calling banks but I had an add on LinkedIN and have gotten calls. The latest one involved an asset manager. Is this not the same as being a broker? In other words- not to get involved. He was talking like the asset management team works in the NEW Banking Platform and you tell them what you want and they send you a tape with it all on there at a certain price. And they have the ability to move 20 to 30 billion a month with all the people they have moving product on this management team.<br>Have you heard of this before? He said everyone is changing to this way of doing things and also stated 200 million minimum, etc. I know- I am calling smaller banks- but I had to get your views on this and if you have ever heard of it before????? Thanks Sal!!!! Website looks great!        </p>

          Considering that most of the banks in this country have less than $3 Billion in assets, and of that if they had 10% of them in NPN or REO and would be out of business, shut down or consolidated (shotgun marriage) with a mid-sized bank.<br><br>I am calling BS. <br><br>Perhaps for the larger ones like BOA, C and JPM, WF; but not the smaller banks. They don&#39;t have that much and that proves my point further to look at the smaller lenders as they wouldn&#39;t be able to play at tehse levels where they would have to add so many assets. <br><br>I think this guy is leading you around. Very few $200mm trades are getting done. If you&#39;re in Las Vegas at the end of the month, ask Gordon. I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll tell you something similar. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Ridiculous nonsense on the tape- too bad because they sent it to me but then I told them I need to be direct with seller- no exceptions- I will sign a CA- with them.<br>They said no that they do not do that because have been burned before! They want a NDA from the buyer! Is this industry really this nonsensical! I stood my ground and was respectful- I guess they do not want to make money. The thing is though they sent me the tape and I have not signed anything! Does not make sense but all good. Obviously better to call banks and get my own deals- This one just happened to come my way off of LinkedIn. Thanks Sal. You taught me well about standing my ground. Other deals out there.......        </p>

          Richard. <br><br>Hopefully you’ve been bitten hard enough by a broker so now you realize why we want you to be direct with a bank. <br><br>Who the hell knows where he was sourcing this from – and my bet was that it wasn’t a bank. <br><br>And the mere fact that he told you that “he’s been burned before” is novice-speak for “we’ve never done this and we don’t have a policy and procedure for dealing with someone who seems savvier and more experienced than we are”. <br><br>Please call the banks. Please. I promise that you will get more assets and faster closings working with directly with lenders and sellers of assets. <br><br>Have you learned your lesson yet? <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Richard, you will come across a term that many brokers like to use, it&#39;s called Vetting. In my experience, it&#39;s BS!!! It usually starts with oh the seller needs you to fill this bio form out, and the seller needs you to sign and attach the NCND and Master Fee Agreement aka MFA.<br><br>Read that back to yourself and immediately what comes to mind? NCND and Master Fee Agreement??? MFA=Multiple Parties in the deal.<br><br>Also, if they are a broker, where would they be in a position to obtain docs direct from the seller??? they aren&#39;t. I&#39;m mentioning this just to give you a heads up.<br><br>I come across a lot of nonsense as well and if you look at the source of the nonsense, you will realize your dealing with unsophisticated people. Unsophisticated=Unprofessional.<br><br>Unprofessional people have zero clue of how to manage their own deals. I usually hear, well the seller who is a bank wants this. I would always defer to Sal to give his opinion of what&#39;s right or wrong.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I understand that the credit facility program is available to those buying bulk REO and loan pools. What are specifics around the equity facility and at what point does it come into the transaction at?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Credit is for those buying REOs in bulk. <br><br>JV Equity is for those buying notes in bulk. <br><br>I have no idea what you mean by what point does it come into the transaction at. <br><br>We have a whole module on this here: <br><br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniult <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I realized recently that any facility is something that is offered to a client directly by Dandrew and that there is no actual seperate submission form to request this. I was looking to gain some insight into when Dandrew would say we can fund your request, however, would a facility work better for you.        </p>

          Bill<br>Here is the risk with seconds that are in a state of NPN. They are obviously sitting behind a large first. If the payor stiffed the second lien holder, they have stiffed the first lien holder.<br><br>Once a foreclosure action takes place and it will, it&#39;s only a matter of time, the second lien holder often gets wiped out because the second lien is junior to the senior debt in a enforceable action.<br><br>The payments are most often very small so there is no real incentive to own these. Once legal is filed, there is very little that can be done to collect on these. The reason these are usually small value is because they were created in a structured deal where there was perhaps a 70% first! a 15% second and the buyer came to the table with 15% hard equity for the down.<br><br>Since Sal reconditioned my thinking, my firm no longer trades in these and will not entertain submissions on these. That&#39;s my two cents.        </p>

          Bill, are you referring to doing a deal with another intermediary that Sal and Dandrew have passed on, that the other intermediary has a buyer for? if your doing a deal like this, don&#39;t try to engineer a crazy deal, just simply create a joint venture agreement, splitting all fees 50/50.<br><br>Paperwork is a simple JV Agreement, funds sent to either partners attorney&#39;s escrow agent who collects payment and splits payments according to agreement and cuts the checks.        </p>

          I recently made the decision a few months ago to pull the trigger and do the upgrade. I could have remained at Banker but wanted to do so much more. Best choice I made. It&#39;s worth spending the money.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have two deals that just came over to me. One is a loan pool and the other is a bulk asset portfolio. The bulk asset portfolio can be carved out, the loan pool is a package and must be bought all in. <br><br>On both types of deals, what is the maximum dollar volume you will consider. On the bulk assets, it has two states, NY/NJ, all the asset values are above the $60K threshold. There are two properties that are not but since this can be a carve out, I think we would kick those back anyway.<br><br>I have a call tomorrow early afternoon.        </p>

          Sal, for clarification...What do you consider a white elephant? I know that you mean the asset costs more to upkeep and therefore lose value quickly unless you can turn them around fast.  Is there a particular asset that tends to act more like a white elephant than others?  Can you clarify what those assets are?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I don&#39;t like broker deals unless it&#39;s coming direct from a commercial real estate broker. These as you know are a 50/50 shot at best to go anywhere, and this is one catalyst for a property ending up on Loop Net.<br><br>One of the strategies I use and have used to find commercial deals is as follows. This is used at the courthouse. In Dallas County and at arrant County, some information is not available online, so I go there twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays.<br><br>First thing I do is I go and look at newly filed property sale information because I am looking for active buyers. What I am looking for is the name of the mortgage payor and the name of the party holding the debt. I cross reference the property and the owner and I can see just how many properties are owned by any individual. I can also tell if they are a cash buyer or a funded buyer.<br><br>I then do a google earth view of the property so I can verify the asset class, and if it&#39;s in the food groups I like, I then I move onto my next thing which is to check property tax records for each property a individual owns. I am looking to see if they are not paying their taxes. This is a good barometer of whether there is financial distress on a property owner.<br><br>Now I go back for up to one year on each property and I&#39;m looking to see if any legal has been filed and from this I can tell if a lender has done a workout, I can tell if the lender has had troubles off and on with this borrower.<br><br>If they&#39;ve had troubles and made concessions, this is a sign that they may be motivated to sell these loans. If the property owner has had properties foreclosed upon and sold off, it&#39;s a good barometer that this individual may be needing funding.<br><br>This seems like a lot of work and it is but it gets a intermediary to be direct to a borrower. Just because someone owns high dollar commercial properties does not mean they understand that they have options outside of conventional lending circles.<br><br>One thing to keep in mind is that when a commercial property owner ends up in trouble with one bank, most banks in town won&#39;t do business with that borrower. Banking is a close circle, very much part of the old boy network, so if Dandrew Intermediaries can get an opportunity to pitch our program, we will have a captive and receptive audience.        </p>

          Sal. I have come across a broker but he has some sense and I told him I need to be direct, etc. You know the deal. Anyway- he hooked me up with one of his guys( broker) maybe he did not know- and this is what is on this uys front page..<br>1.      MNDA and Fee Agreement (Day 1-2)<br>2.     Seller CA if necessary and register with Seller (Day2-3)<br>3.     Release of details (Day 2-3)<br>4.     LOI and POF with (Day 5)<br>5.     Purchase Agreement, deposit, and opening of escrow (Day 5-7)<br>6.     Due Diligence (Day 7-21)<br>7.     Remove Contingencies (Day 7-28)<br>8.     Close<br><br>I responded back to the guy and said we always do D.D. first before we sign agreement and we do not issue LOI or POF until we know what we have. I also asked him how he expects to get paid- etc- Point is- he does have a tape on his site 176 assets for 3 million- but not even wasting my time or anyone elses on your end after reading this.  Lets see what he responds back with. But I will ask at what time do we need to issue POF if all else looks good in any deal- as they want to make sure that we have the funds to do the deal?? Also I have never heard you mention deposits on a deal. When does this happen????? Thanks and wanted to share this one..... Isn&#39;t this fun???? Need to make money of course but this is part of it- just do not see a check yet is all.        </p>

          I&#39;ve seen this type of stuff before, and when you pin them down their usual answer is well this is my sellers protocol.. They don&#39;t even know that this doesn&#39;t work, they just push deals out and hope something sticks. They have nothing at stake except their time and they are too dumb to understand everyone&#39;s time is worth something.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been thinking about this entire POF situation and how they can be properly distributed and I have some ideas.<br><br>1. Make the POF&#39;s password protected where the POF&#39;s go to attorneys and principle parties only. They never touch the Intermediaries hands. The receiver of the POF must be verified .<br><br>2. This serves two purposes, it protects the POF from getting into the wrong hands and it forces the Intermediary to be direct and not involved in broker deals.<br><br>3. Add an addendum that states any misuse of the POF is subject to legal action and subject to criminal charges being filed for financial fraud.        </p>

          Technically speaking, sounds good. Pragmatically speaking, it won&#39;t work for several reasons, many of which being that the Intermediaries need the POFs and don&#39;t want it behind a veil of an attorney or princi*pal*. As in Sal is your PAL. <br><br>Thank you though for your ideas. I appreciate that. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Now that I&#39;ve upgraded and my scope of what I can now do has increased above Banker, and after putting the word out, I&#39;ve got a potential opportunity for a pool of seconds consisting of 22 properties, in NY and Florida. It was originally 23 but on one of the assets, the lender pulled it out as they did a workout on the loan.<br><br>It is residential and finally after the country music song intro I get to the question. On these types of pools, what does Dandrew like to see for the UPB range and where does Dandrew&#39;s pain tolerance kick in with regard to pricing expectations or is there not one?        </p>

          I have a private seller of  a hotel in Houston Tx.  She is VERY motivated as her husband is sick and she can&#39;t operate it. She shut it down not being able to operate it since 2011.  She has several commercial properties that she may want to sell too. They have very little UPB owned since 2000.        </p>

          Molly: <br><br>You ask them. Its the hotel equivalent of a McDonald&#39;s Franchise; very structured in management, operations and services. <br><br>Holiday Inn<br>Ramada<br>Hyatt<br><br>You know the brands. <br><br>The opposite is what you see on that show my wife makes me watch called Hotel Impossible. Some sorry sap buys a hotel and runs it into the ground. <br><br>So, would you rather own an equity piece in a Ramada or in a &quot;Notell&quot; Motel? <br><br>Smaller hotels that are not flagged are not desirable. Meaning don&#39;t send them in for financing. I don&#39;t care about the story. Its a hard and fast rule. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I know you are really busy this next week coming up, however, I have something that I think your really going to like. One of my new partners has deep connections to wealthy investor and I am thinking family office money from Dubai that I think they would like to have Dandrew put to work for them.<br><br>What do you need from them to get the ball rolling. They are aware of my position as an Intermediary with Dandrew but don&#39;t know your name or Dandrews name per se.<br><br>I asked how liquid they are and he said they can stroke a check for $10,000,000.00 right now without blinking an eye or losing sleep. I am going to do a conference call with them middle of this week to advise what you need to see from them.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>The hotel fund I&#39;m helping start has two hotel targets of immediate interest, located in Memphis and Boulder. Boulder hotel has a conduit loan that matures in 2017. The lender is saying hotel is stuck in loan, loan amount $2.3 million.<br><br>Have you ever heard of being stuck in a conduit loan and can a DPO loan be used on something like this to retire the debt out of the stack?        </p>

          Yes. We see a lot of them. But it requires approval from the (special) servicer. You also hope the special servicer has the discretion to accept a DPO. Most do, some have to go back to the trusts who are the beneficiaries of the loan and that is a very tangled web.         </p>

          Sal,<br>My intern came up with a plan. Substitute an equally yielding income vehicle such as high yield treasury bonds into the securitized loan pool for the right to pull out the loan in event Servicer will fight a DPO, in order to get the servicer to agree to it. Not sure if this can be accomplished or not.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Someone asked me recently about how I am able to call banks and get them to be receptive and I haven&#39;t really shared what I do, but then my intern said why don&#39;t you just put it out there so the members can hear it from someone who is putting it to work. So here goes...<br><br>First thing I do is I do exactly what Sal tells us to do, use The FDIC infographic and the steps listed in their exact order. I don&#39;t deviate from it!!!<br><br>Tip... Do not reinvent the wheel, the things Sal teaches are not trial and error, they work but only if you do it the right way.<br><br>Next thing I do is I print off the entire information for each bank I find. I want to have that in front if me when I call. I then segment the banks by city and I begin to setup days I&#39;m calling. I devote one day to each city or area.<br><br>I put each bank in order by the amount of loans and reo&#39;s they have, going highest to lowest. The higher the volume, the more in trouble they are in and more likely to talk to me.<br><br>When I call, I introduce myself and my company. I always ask for the CFO, Chief Credit Officer or Director of Whole Loan Trading.<br><br>Once I get them on the phone, I re-introduce myself and simply tell them the following:<br><br>&quot;We understand that they have a significant amount of loans and oreo&#39;s that have been reported as being in a state of less than performing to some level and I would like to know how much they would need to dispose of to get their balance sheets back to a level that will put them in a position of being more healthy&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m wording it in a way that they can feel like I&#39;m genuinely trying to be a problem solver. The next thing I say to them is that we are looking for first lien position loans, performing, re-performing, scratch and dent or NPN. <br><br>It&#39;s at this point that I inform them that the volume level that they may want to dispose of may be more than we can afford, however, I am backed by a fund that is financially strong and are also providers of solutions and ask if I can bring them into the deal.<br><br>I&#39;m being up front, I&#39;m letting them know that I on my own May not be able to buy but the fund I work with, is in a position. <br><br>Then I cut them off at the what will you pay pass by informing them that bids are made as principal bids and are based upon market conditions. I also tell them if your looking for a bid right now, today without us or the fund having the benefit of the proper initial review, we will not be a player in your space.<br><br>I then ask when can I expect a tape from you and I tell them what we need to see in order to be in a position to have a successful initial bid.<br><br>I then thank them and I say, if you are aware of any other bankers who may want to talk, I am available to speak with them, Monday to Friday, 9 to 5 pm central time.<br><br>This is what I do, I do exactly what Sal teaches. Hope this is helpful.        </p>

          Rudy,<br>I find that if you call mid morning, you have better luck. Don&#39;t know why it is. I&#39;m thinking that once they have had coffee, listened to voice mails, checked priority emails, had a staff meeting, they are available live.        </p>

          Sal,<br>On the call today, I believe you said that there are some great opportunities in the real estate sector that your seeing that doesn&#39;t necessarily involve properties, if your coming across great opportunities are you entering into JV&#39;s or are you buying out the operator and taking over the concept and creating a profit center?        </p>

          Sal,<br>The NNN net lease deals Sean discussed are obviously very specialized deals. I understand the 25 year term lease and I understand the debt piece and the basics of it. My question is this, would Dandrew come in and make a debt loan for a long term deal such as these?        </p>

          James<br><br>Good question. *No.* The reason is we&#39;re short term and the loans on these are amo&#39;ed at 22 years. These are stabilized deals where the operator can get cheap financing from a life company for this product. Not expensive bridge or equity debt. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal, this is a great question.  I would say I will do what&#39;s necessary to protect the investors and to ensure that our returns are kept on target. The investors and their capital and the security and fiduciary trust are of importance.<br><br>I would expect that the other fund manager will pull his weight.        </p>

          *&quot;I would say I will do what’s necessary to protect the investors and to ensure that our returns are kept on target.&quot;*<br><br>James, you&#39;ve been with us now to know enough that this sounds cute, but I have no idea what this means. An accountant can do the same thing for much cheaper. You&#39;re going to have to be more thoughtful about this. <br><br>Specificity and thoughtfulness adds a lot of value here and you need to do some brain-damage to figure this out. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          In terms of heavy lifting, I will do what is necessary on my side of the desk to make sure that investors money is protected, because they come first. However, the best course of action is to hire a team and delegate responsibilities to them. I realize where you directing my thinking towards, which is that one person can start a fund, but it is still a business that requires a team of experienced people to make it a success.        </p>

          I agree about finding someone on Odesk, I thought about what I wrote after I wrote it and looked myself in the mirror and said good god man.<br><br>I was going to write the content myself however I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s best to let someone do it and outsource it.

          Yes. But you have to be very careful about who you hire to do this. <br><br>Ex-wives, new in-laws, old out-laws. Don&#39;t run your business like a Greek Diner. <br><br>Each one of my graphics cost about $4 to make on Odesk for my decks. <br><br>And if you email it to me, I&#39;ll gladly critique it - *just make sure it is the best job you can do prior to sending.

I realize everyday is a learning opportunity.<br><br>At the risk of sounding cutesy, I really want to be that guy that gets to have discretion and I realize this comes with being on top of fiduciary duty and proving myself.<br><br>I am looking at bringing in a talented team to make this fund a success.        </p>

          Sal, <br>Here is another update. I wanted to run this by you. I&#39;ve got the full picture I think on this...<br><br>Seller is a fund that has done 7 funds and is rolling out their 8th fund. They are doing a $20M capital raise on the 8th fund and on one, he still has $17M to spend.<br><br>They buy SFR&#39;s from banks as bulk product and then resell and hold the paper. The paper is written at 10%, 30 year amo, balloons of varying lengths.<br><br>They have pulled product across all their funds and have $130,000,000.00 in paper  and they are selling product to either raise capital or meet the stips on the funds.<br><br>They have paper across many states, Michigan is one that they know will not have as high a return as others. In some states they are getting 75% of UPB that&#39;s performing and of course less on NPN.<br><br>He wants to meet with me next Thursday at which time he will release several tapes to me. He said that on most funds they have multiple limited partners and they too have invested capital placed in their funds.<br><br>These guys are numbers guys and he said they have to have an offer that makes sense from a standpoint of returns. They understand what it is we want, there is no educating here.<br><br>He said please come ready to do business and ready to walk out with what I need to begin doing business.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I guess I am the question man this evening. If I am on the FDIC website, I can see banks that are in the process of being shut down, anyone looking at the site can see the same thing.<br><br>My question is are these a prime target to buy loan pools from and bulk OREO&#39;s from or are they too far gone once the process of shutting them down has been initiated?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;m a bit bothered this evening about something someone said awhile back and wanted to share it. I went to the POF section of AskDandrew and saw where someone wrote about joining the Arb program because of the POF and now they feel out of water, I&#39;m paraphrasing that of course.<br><br>I am bothered that someone would join just because of that one tool. I feel like the real essence of the opportunity has been missed.<br><br>Last time I checked, and hopefully I don&#39;t have to put my head in the oven over the next thing I say, but, unless we are actually becoming the buyer and borrowing funds from Dandrew, we don&#39;t need a POF. I think that if someone is IM&#39;ing the deal and they use the POF, that they could be giving the impression that they are the buyer.<br><br>I&#39;m big on being transparent, I don&#39;t lose sleep over being honest. One thing that has got me into the party on some deals is that I&#39;m transparent.<br><br>If I&#39;m the buyer, I say so and if I&#39;m the buyers rep for deals I&#39;m bringing to you, I say that I am going to bring this deal to my fund manager for their review.<br><br>I feel that the secret sauce for us is being aligned with a Dandrew.        </p>

          Jack<br><br>We&#39;ve seen a lot of our smaller, less experienced competitors get caught holding assets where the leasees have gone dark or are planning to. <br><br>Keep in mind, most developers don’t really know the general financial condition of their tenants.

          Read both of the articles and listened again to AJ&#39;s pitch.  One of the points made by the audience was that real estate investing is local.  One question was the impact online retailers such as Amazon would have on brick and mortar stores.  Another was the effect that market cycles would have on retailers.<br><br>Regarding real estate investing being local, I contacted Tyler Young - Ardmore Development Authority to get the latest information.  Here is Tyler&#39;s response to my question.<br><br> &quot;The most accurate information I can give you on the current unemployment rate for Carter County is 3.1% as of April 2014, which was a 0.8% decrease from March. Also, Ardmore’s median Household income is $38,383 according to the US Census Bureau’s information. As for your question about the impact of the developments in the oil and gas business, as you can tell by the unemployment rating, Ardmore has certainly benefited from the advances in the industry. In addition, Ardmore has seen record highs in retail sales and building permits which can also be tied to the various developments in the energy fields. I hope this answer was helpful to you, was there anything else I could do for you? If so, please do not hesitate to ask.&quot;  <br><br>Circuit City was Ardmore&#39;s largest employer when they went out of business and it hurt Ardmore.  But as you can see from the current unemployment rate, this has been absorbed.  Michelin is another large local employer and they are expanding their manufacturing capability.<br><br>Probably the largest contributor to Ardmore&#39;s current economic/unemployment picture is the oil and gas industry and the expanding production.  The oil patch is not something that can be shut down and moved to China.<br><br>The growth in the nation&#39;s economy, such as it is, can be traced almost entirely to the energy sector.  <br><br>I am not sure what stronger economic indicators you would want in a city/region.<br><br>Regarding everyone buying everything online.  While high tech/office workers in larger cities may buy a lot/most things online, like AJ said, that is not the demographic here.  People in this demographic, while they shop online, shop locally and the teenagers use shopping as a social outing.<br><br>With the energy sector being the only bright spot on the economic horizon, that I see, I think the future of retailers in this market is much brighter than in markets that are dependent on pushing paper and not oil. <br>        </p>

          Jack, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in Oklahoma. I like Ardmore. The largest employers in Ardmore are the Michelin Tire Plant, Dollar General Stores, Valero Energy which owns Valero Gas and C Store retailers and a few others and I believe this is why the unemployment rate has decreased. Also you have to factor in Winstar Casino, which currently employs 2300 people in many capacities.<br><br>You and I are both in DFW, you and I both know that when the energy business is booming, everything gets on a rise economically, money is in it&#39;s pleasure mode, new jobs arrive, etc.<br><br>When the energy business declines, most towns end up like Big Springs, Texas. Depressed, money is screaming bloody murder, times are bad.<br><br>The one problem with shopping malls is the online presence of many retailers. Many retailers close stores and evolve into having a huge Amazon like presence which kills mall leases. It&#39;s not easy to fill spaces. Mall owners are not going to reduce rental rates just to get someone in, unless there is a rent escalation that can be favorable at some point.<br><br>In NY, NJ, CT and PA, some mall owners will actually create rent concessions because there are other lease incentives involved that make a rent concession better for the owners.<br><br>While I cannot speak for Sal or Dandrew, I am thinking that if this mall was like a North Park or a Galleria or even Parks Mall in Arlington, they would be able to go to committee and justify giving a $3M funding. <br><br>The risk in this deal is obvious, not many national retailers are going to be beating down the doors to Ardmore OK to become tenants of this mall. If the current tenants decide they&#39;ve had enough of retail, they will leave one by one.<br><br>Case in point, a Irving Mall in Irving, Texas. If it weren&#39;t for Burlington Coat Factory, the mall would slowly die a sudden and justified death. Shoppers World will never bring continued traffic to that mall.        </p>

          If I am the sales manager for a &#39;national retailer&#39; then I am going to know who my customers are and where they live. If my customers shop on 5th Avenue or Rodeo Drive, then I know that they are not a significant portion of Ardmore.  If my customers are the working class then they are in Ardmore.  <br><br>My job as a sales manager is to put my outlets in locations where sales will be made. Am I going to look in NY, NJ, CT or PA for locations where the local economy has a 3.1% unemployment rate and a household income of $38,383? Think I could look long and hard and not find those conditions in those states.<br><br>My research department is going to tell me where my customers are and what the economic conditions are in those areas.  If the economy is based on one major company, then that area is not as attractive. If on the other hand the economy is underpinned by a diverse business/manufacturing base and the resurgence of the oil and gas production brought about by new technology that has brought new life and production levels never before seen in the oil patch, then this is going to be a place that I am interested in. I don&#39;t think that anyone thinks the increased oil and gas production is only going to last a year or so.<br><br>One of the credit tenants in this mall that has 9 years left on a 10 year lease has just been relocated to a more prominent 15,000 sq ft location and Ulta Cosmetics will be occupying a new 10,000 location which will add $210,000 to the NOI.  The owners of this mall have recently sold another mall in Ardmore at a 7% cap rate. Not exactly a fire sale.<br><br>Regarding online sales replacing retail outlets.  Like AJ said in his presentation, the demographics of this area are not the ones who buy the majority of their things online.  They are computer literate but still go to retail stores to buy what they want now. If I am looking for a &#39;big ticket item&#39; and do not need it today, then online is definitely a viable option. If I am looking for some sports gear to use this weekend or my wife is looking for cosmetics then we are shopping locally.<br><br>Regarding the Irving Mall, the changing demographics around a mall can kill it.  You could also say the same thing about the former Red Bird Mall, now Southwest Mall, in Duncanville, TX. The customer base for these malls moved. These malls then had to replace the old tenants with ones whose target customers are the ones who filled in for the former customers.<br><br>Regarding rent concessions. Rent concessions are part of life for any property that leases space, be it retail, office, multi-family, or states offering Tax Incentives to companies to get them to locate there.  Look at the current ads running on TV for NY offering 10 years tax free for locating there.<br><br>All investing involves risk.  Even not investing is risky, ever heard of inflation?  Lowest perceived risk would be Treasury&#39;s (although some could argue that this could be the riskiest of all), gold or silver (but how much control do you have on what happens there), the stock market (does anyone really believe that this is not a bubble) or real estate backed that are income producing.          </p>

          A couple of additional comments. If this mall was like a North Park or Galleria, both high end Dallas malls, I don&#39;t think that I could recommend it because the customers/demographics of their customer base is well above the $38,383 of the median Ardmore household income.  Again, you have to know who your customers are and what they buy.         </p>

          Jack,<br>I used the NY, NJ, PA markets as a point of conversation because I am a New Yorker but am here in Dallas the past twenty years. I know those markets well.<br><br>My reply to you was not for the purpose of gaining such a terse reply by you. The situation with any mall, anywhere is that you are subject to the financial conditions of the shopping public.<br><br>Just as many low wage income earners shop at high dollar malls as do wealthy individuals. Galleria Mall in Dallas has just as many used vehicles in the lot as there are Bentleys. <br><br>Shopping choices come down to people&#39;s desires more often than cost to acquire. If I were funding this deal which obviously I&#39;m not but I probably have a funder for this deal, here is how I would be viewing this.<br><br>1. I would be looking at the population of Ardmore, Oklahoma to gain a full understanding of the demographic and the median income, which is $38,000.<br><br>2. The borrower is investing $5M dollars to update a mall that still has the income of shoppers at $38K per year.<br><br>3. Where is this $5M number in the capital stack??? Are they taking debt on or is this from their own resources?<br><br>4. What is the NOI for this mall? can it fully support the capital stack<br><br>5. What happens to this mall if a developer decides to come in and build a super regional mall between Ardmore and OKC with big name national tenants who have zero issue with being out in the middle of no where and what happens. <br><br>6. What happens if a developer comes in and builds a master planned community and drives this traffic away, what happens to the ability of this ownership to support debt?<br><br>And Jack, not all National Sales Managers are bright enough to really understand markets their stores are located in. There have been many NSM&#39;s who kept a store open longer than they should have, causing a chain to go up in smoke.<br><br>Sometimes it&#39;s not always the obvious that causes a deal to go south.        </p>

          I did not mean for my reply to be terse.  My point is that the product you are selling must be aligned with the wants, needs and ability of your target customer.  I spent about 40 years in technical sales to aerospace and defense. I learned the first day that I had to identify who had a need for and could use my product.  That is the point I was making.<br><br>Shopping malls have a pull radius for the majority of their customers and while there are &#39;used&#39; cars in the parking lot of the Galleria, there are many stores there that cater to the 6 or 7 figure income shopper.  As far as &#39;shopping choices coming down to desires more often than cost to acquire&#39; I am sure that the customer who drives the 2009 Ford would rather have the 2014 S500, but then reality sets in.<br><br>All of the financials were supplied to Dandrew and yes the $5mm for renovations is in the capital stack. The NOI will support a sale at a 7% cap of $20mm+. The owners of this mall have sold another mall in Ardmore in the last 4 months at a 7 cap.<br><br>As far as a developer building a super regional mall between Ardmore and OK City would be extremely as there is not enough population density to support it.  The same could be said of a master planned community. <br><br>But then, what would happen to the cost of gold if the Alchemists finally succeed?<br><br>        </p>

          Jack<br><br>It took me about 30 mins to craft this response. Here it is. <br><br>The consumer here is a low skilled, low income wage earner who&#39;s salary and discretionary spending is increasingly restricted. <br><br>This has nothing to do with &quot;selling a product&quot;. Investors don&#39;t care about that. They see the bifurcation of the middle class into the wealthy and the poor. No middle ground. It&#39;s well known that a major reason why the middle class is in decline is the *stagnation of wages*. <br><br>While it is true that going to the mall is a fun experience for some, and a way to pass time for the seniors, that does not translate into sales to generate the profits to retailers to maintain large, expensive stores. It is highly likely that the shift to stores becoming more like showrooms, and therefore taking less space, is going to accelerate. With the logistics of next day shipping now becoming highly efficient, stores no longer need to have the space formerly required for inventory storage. Amazon and others have perfected warehouse to residential front door delivery to a science and that means less space by bricks and mortar retail. It does mean more warehouse space easily accessible to major highways and rail in urban areas. It will get harder over time to find larger tenants who need the same space they once had. *Retail as a whole remains overcapacitied.*<br><br>Many of the retail employees are lower wage people and they will be caught up in the Obamacare nightmare of what to do about insurance. The issues for large retailers is their cost of healthcare is going to rise as the requirements of what has to be covered in a policy hit premiums, and so labor costs for the retailer will rise. If you accept that online shopping is going to impact space needs and usage, and you combine it with the cost issue of labor, then you will see that paying higher rents is a problem. Lastly, as we just saw this past Christmas, retail didn’t have a promising start. Sales were down, discounting was rampant and profits at retailers were squeezed *badly*. <br><br>What we care about is the health of the company later. JCP is struggling. Badly. So are some of the other middle-class consumer staples. I know you think that these brands will be here forever, but when the Affordable Healthcare Act expenses erode spending, coupled with more people on government assistance programs than there are productive workers, and credit being constricted, this is what the death spiral for these malls is. Sears is no different, Lampert didn’t do what everyone thought he would do with this. <br><br>*You’re confused when you mention AJs fund*. That is for grocery-anchored retail (aka *”broadline retial*”). No consumer discretionary staples. <br><br>These stores serve a sedentary population, who use their EBT cards for these foodstuffs and is not seen in most ways competing with Amazon. <br><br>So Jack, knowing what you know now, would you invest your life savings into this deal?  <br><br>Just a yes or no is required from your gut here. <br><br>Sal        </p>

        <p>
          Not to beat a dead horse but retail capacity that is excess in one location can not be loaded on a truck and taken to another area where it is needed.  <br><br>As far as low skilled workers vs high skilled workers, the worker who has skills that are in demand by the market is the one who has a job.  I have watched engineers with PHDs driving taxi cabs and swearing that they only had a high school education.  I have seen engineers with MS not be hired because the employer only needed someone with a BS and the employer knew that when times got better, the MS would move on. There are jobs available if someone is willing to develop the skills needed and move to where the jobs are.<br><br>That being said, the class of real estate that I see as being in danger of going dark before retail are office buildings.  There are several large complexes here in Dallas that are very dim or dark and Dallas is definitely not Detroit.  With today&#39;s technology, other than the ego, why do most companies need large or small offices in an office building?  All that is needed is a phone and internet connection.  For those times when a personal meeting is needed or video conferencing, then rent the time from a hot chair company that rent by the hour. <br><br>Banks also fall into that category.  I do virtually all of my bill paying on line and bank transactions at the ATM. <br><br>So I get back to my original question which is: With all of the negative doom and gloom and the sky is falling, what should I be looking for?        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>To answer your question about whether or not I would invest in this if I had the funds.  I come from this demographic and have lived long enough to have gone through several ups and downs in the economy.  Are changes coming, definitely. Will it happen in the next year or so, don&#39;t think so.  It is tempting to look at the broad brush predictions about over capacity and retail going dark without looking at where the over capacity is.  How much retail &#39;over&#39; capacity is in Detroit or Gary, IN or other places where whole industries have moved out?<br><br>Regarding low skill vs high skill.  I supported a wife and two sons on a basic skill I learned in high school.  This skill allowed me to eventually start my own company.  I finally went back to college to get my B.S. in Marketing (I have a B.S in BS). It only took me 34 years to complete, not because I needed it but because I wanted it.  My point is that having a skill that is needed in the market is the key, not that you have a PHD in Navajo basket weaving and then complain that you can not find a job.<br><br>If I had to make a choice between investing in real estate in Ardmore, OK with a 3.1% unemployment rate that is declining and a household income that is 140% of the national median income with the oil patch going like crazy or a small town in the mid-west where all of the citizens are on welfare and use their EBT cards to buy all of their needs, then I will chose Ardmore.        </p>

          Jack<br><br>First, I’ll respond, however, I’m not obligated to. You’ve been a member for a while, I like and respect you (no matter what you think of me…) so I’ll answer this. I know you’re active and I support the active people with a passion.  These take a long time to craft carefully and sometimes I have to have AJ review it so it doesn’t sound so terse and give other Intermediaries the bad impression. <br><br>My goal here is to make everyone *think*. That is why I crafted this response. There are some folks here reading this who have a few million in the bank and may do something with it that could get them wiped out. <br><br>*1. Regarding AJ’s Deal:* I appreciate what you are saying about AJs deal; however you’re talking about 2 different narrow niches here. <br><br>Comparing this to AJs fund which is really narrow is not what we’re doing here. But I have to say that AJ’s tenants for his deal are seen as being much stronger than most credits (aka “credit tenants”) on your deals rent roll because they are owned by a very big private equity firm that has a very strong balance sheet. <br><br>Also, since this idea has been conceived, larger private equity players have come in and have done something similar in this space. <br><br>And if the feedback from AJ’s pitch (soon to be released as a Continuing Ed) to a group of very, very wealthy family offices is any indication, it’s a winning idea. That is the smart money.  <br><br>(If people buy HUD housing because they want the stable monthly checks from the government, why should it be any different for EBT and food stamps?)<br><br>*1. Regarding your deal:* We’re talking about having Dandrew provide debt and equity to a developer who is looking to convert an old smaller, concert hall into a shopping area. To use this he is cross collateralizing a mall he is developing in Ardmore, OK that has some tenants who are getting hit. <br><br>These tenants, regardless of the micro, Ardmore-based unemployment rate are subjected to the same <br>market forces. JC Penney is not seen as a “credit tenant”. The middle class is getting squeezed more and more every day. <br><br>The American economy is *not* strong, no matter what anyone tells you on TV, and we’ve seen some colleagues recent get hurt in North Dakota in the oil business as well; its boom and bust and I think the fracking business is on its way out. Not now, but in 2 years it will be different. A lot of these deposits haven’t been as fruitful as once thought they were. But that is a different story altogether. <br><br>If your middle class in a job it’s downright awful; you’re losing money each year, there is no job security and that affects spending. It always has, and it always will. There may not be soup lines but the pain is probably even more acute today.  <br><br>If you own your own business, you are not subjected to the same wage compression, you’re future is seen as being more stable and you have more discretionary money to spend. <br><br>At the end of the day, what I’m telling you is that I’m not smarter than you or anyone else, just *much more experienced*. I get paid to look at these deals to insulate my investors and be a custodian for their money. They look to me to really dig in to see where the risks are. This deal is painted with more risk than what most capital providers would be comfortable with. I’m the jealous ex-boyfriend doing the best due diligence I can on these deals. That is why I manage so much. They know the last person anyone wants to question their due diligence is mine. Its why our staff and AJ has spent *2 years of his life in my office*, to learn this method of *thinking* like a jilted lover, metaphorically speaking. <br><br>And when AJ came in, he was the happy sap. Today he is just as happy, richer, but 100% less “sap”. Ask anyone who’s been with us for a while and they will tell you this. <br><br>*Honest financial research is a discipline. It requires us to not only understand the fundamentals, but to question the fundamentals. It requires us to look beyond what we would LIKE to see in the economy, and accept the reality of what is actually there.* That is how we structure our deals: *we simply attempt to structure the risk away from the deals* as we craft a solution to them. <br><br>To answer your question on what we have been working on in *retail* are “lifestyle” centers that have a higher end, clientele that have been booming for a while. For example one of these centers was a loan facing maturity default with leasees such as Williams Sonoma, Capitol Grill, a Talbots, Whole Foods and some others of equal caliber that I can’t remember off hand. This is based in CA. Regardless, if it were based in Dallas, it would still be attractive. <br><br>The fringe buyers on the lower end of the scale are facing extinction, hence I think that’s why you’ll see a lot of TGIFridays and Applebee’s start to get stressed. They will simply go to McDonalds, generally speaking. <br><br>*You need to learn to look at the numbers dispassionately.* We’re still in business and doing well because we considered ourselves to be more macro looking at these deals. Many people got into deals based on *emotion* and got killed. How do I know this? I raised $15mm around OFREEFund.com to manage this. <br><br>So at the end of the day, focus on defaulted note deals at a strong basis - that’s 60% of our business (and our colleagues too actually) and steer clear of these deals where there is more sizzle than steak. And you’ll get paid. <br><br>There are tons of these deals out there. But it requires everyone to be focused on what is going to close, not on what “should” close based on sentiment or emotion. <br><br>I could be wrong, but 12 year track record  on my own and a solid reputation as a risk manager tells me otherwise. <br><br>Still your pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Recently I&#39;ve been seeing deals come across my desk where the sellers want to sell entire pools of loan servicing. I have been wondering why and I received my answer today. I thought this might be of interest to the community.<br><br>I read a blog today and this was what was said...<br><br>Dodd-Frank Affects Lenders Who Service Scratch and Dent Loans...<br>Many mortgage lenders decide to service scratch and dent loans, defective loans and non-performing loans which cannot be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac due to some type of underwriting error.<br><br>Lenders Service these loans as opposed to selling them for a loss on the secondary market. Because of the sweeping regulatory changes, lenders now face a more complicated and expensive regulatory framework for servicing loans.<br><br>My question is this, wouldn&#39;t capital professionals and others like us be a better choice for selling these loans to than having the banks back against the wall in having to deal with these problematic loans?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on the capital raise for the medical project I spoke about recently. We did the presentation to a room of 35 tonight.<br><br>I did the capital raise presentation and the other team embers handled legal, project plans, etc. After the event wad open to Q and A, we seemed to get far more questions from this one group of 5 doctors.<br><br>At the end of the evening, here is what the pitched us on.<br><br>1. They will provide $5,000,000.00 immediately for a 20% ownership. They will provide management services for an additional 10% stake. These are 4 plastic surgeons who invest together. They will receive proportionate income based off the 20% and cash out the 10% stake in year three. They will retain 20% ownership for the remainder of the project.<br><br>2. When they cash out their 10% stake in year three, they will then have the option of continuing management at a monthly fee of $7500.00 or stop at that point.<br><br>3. They will provide expansion capital for the second and third center and will commit another $10M for this endeavor.<br><br>4. Additional details are that we will master lease center number 1 for $50,000.00, paid $25K each 6 months. We will master lease for three years then we will have an option to buy it for $600K, paying a total over three years of $750,000.00.<br><br>5. I get a check within 48 hours for $25,500.00 as a fee for services and 5% ownership in center 1. Not bad for three weeks of work and some additional deal structuring and negotiations work.<br><br>So we raised $5M now with another 10M  within 18 months. The investor group liked my work and have some additional consulting opportunities they want to discuss Friday over Golf.        </p>

          From a list of medical center supporters and CPA&#39;s who do work with medical practitioners, the main invitation list was created, these investors who pulled the trigger on this were actually referred by a PGA Golfer who plays at our country club.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve decided in my commercial funding business to focus on three food groups, Multi family, medical office and warehouse. North Texas has a lot going on in the warehouse space.<br><br>My question us aside from the lending parameters already established by Dandrew, are there any additional caveats that need to be in the deal to make it worthwhile for Dandrew to fund outside of tenant type, lease duration and expiration, etc.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Since banks really cannot lend at this time and have been now in a position in some cases to have a lot of excess capital and have been buying loans from other banks, aren&#39;t they still needing to follow regulatory laws and are limited in how much they can actually buy from another bank?<br><br>If Dandrew is bidding on loans from a bank and another bank is also a bid on the same pool, isn&#39;t the bank in a better position to win that bid because their basis level is different from say a firm such as Dandrew?        </p>

          *If Dandrew is bidding on loans from a bank and another bank is also a bid on the same pool, isn’t the bank in a better position to win that bid because their basis level is different from say a firm such as Dandrew?*<br><br>Excellent question. Its not the *basis level*, its their *cost of capital*. It may be cheaper. Gordon will cover this at the workshop in depth, but if they have a cheaper cost of capital they can bid higher. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick question. On loan pools, is the minimum asset value $60K just as it is with Bulk REO?. A mortgage company has a pool of 215 loans they want an all-in on. The FMV is in the neighborhood of $33K.<br><br>Also have a pool from a different seller of 268 loans in Michigan, P and NPN that can be carved out. They told me it are land contracts and they are willing to let carve outs occur.<br><br>They said while most who allow cherry picking/ carve outs will expect a premium price for the right, they are in lieu of charging a premium, want the buyer to buy a minimum of 5.<br><br>Should I send the tape on the 268?        </p>

          Sal,<br>We ran into a problem today and had to get our attorney on this. The seller has an intern that released the tape when it was nit supposed to be released.<br><br>It has about 10% of assets in Detroit with the other 90% throughout Michigan. The tape was not to be released because the seller, an investment company was in process on doing workouts and other processes underway.<br><br>I got my attorney involved because I wanted to be sure we weren&#39;t in the middle of something we didn&#39;t need to be in. I knew we weren&#39;t but I wanted to be sure.<br><br>Anyway, as it turns out, the seller is an investment company that buys SFR&#39;s from banks, rehabs them if needed then resells them and holds the paper. They sell using the land contract process.<br><br>He has 6000 loans right now, throughout the country that he wants to sell and  is willing to discuss with me. He said his pricing expectations are between 43 and 50% of the UPB, depending upon the property, jurisdiction, how much they have into it, etc.<br><br>He said they could sit in these through the term but they really want to liquidate and reinvest because this is their business model. These guys are professional investors who understand the market, the business, financing, asset liquidation, modeling, etc.<br><br>He asked me about deals I&#39;ve been involved with not necessarily closed. He said he likes to know my story on deals I&#39;ve done, what I did with them, he said a lot of deals never see closing so he can&#39;t base a decision on my experience and capabilities by being concerned with only closed deals.<br><br>I told him about the rough deals I sent over to you, but never mentioned Dandrew or you. He said he was glad I mentioned them. He said they don&#39;t buy rough assets in war zones or at sub par pricing just to buy something. He said his firm buys turn keys but rehabs to bring the properties up to their standards and are mostly cosmetics anyway.<br><br>He said their name and their stamp is in every deal so each property must be at a certain level, as it enables them to sell at better prices.<br><br>I will keep you posted.        </p>

          JV/Mezz Loan: Mining/Exploration Canada: Graphite, Titanium, Gold, Silver and Other Minerals  <br><br>Sponsor has a 25-year ironclad lease on the 8,200 acre land located in Canada that has various types of mineralization that were shown in the previous years of exploration.  Over $7 mil has been spent to date to drill 146 holes that were tested all positive; the most important asset is the presence of Graphite (mineral that will revolutionize the chip technology), Titanium, Gold, Silver, Copper, and many others.   The land is valued today at more than $50 billion, and was divided in several zoning for mining: <br><br>M Zone: Significant Sedex type polymetallic precious metal massive sulphide deposit. Drilled indicated <br>and inferred resource of 1.2 million tons grading 9.85 oz. /t Silver, 6.06 % Zinc, 2.67% Lead, 0.06% Copper<br>and .026 oz. /t Gold down to the 1300 foot level.  Screen Analysis was done on 2 drill holes and the Silver<br>assays averaged 20 ounces/T and the Gold came out at 3 grams/t. Based on the type of deposit and the geology<br>data, experts believes the M Zone has 3 times the resource indicated.<br><br>Project would start with mining the M zone. Potential Gross Annual Revenue (USD) (Ag, Zn, Pb, Au, Cu) <br>= $ 134,806,600 <br><br>G Zone: Graphitic Argillite and Titanium: <br><br>Deep penetration electromagnetic survey (six drill holes) as well an Airborne EM survey picked the huge<br> Graphitic Argillite Horizon ranging in width from 46 to 149 feet.      <br>Samples of core were submitted to SGS Research, Lakefield and assayed up to 2% Graphitic Carbon.  <br>Important to note that this horizon contains 14 pounds/Ton of Titanium which can be easily recovered by floatation producing a high grade Titanium concentrate.     <br><br>C Zones: The C Lake area continues to return very encouraging gold and base metal assays associated with<br> Arsenopyrite in structural and volcanic terrains. Recent drilling has intersected Gold values up to 13 g/t over 0.5m, <br>8 g/t over 3 m, 2.4 g/t over 8.8 m and 4.3 g/t over 1.4 m. Sampling from trenches assayed 0.5 oz. /t Gold.<br><br>Current market value of the land = $50 billion<br>Skin in the game = land ($50 billon)+ $20 million<br>Loan Request = $200 million for mining <br><br>I know this is another “Big Elephant” project you are not interested in, but this may be big deal for an investor you may know, who has money and wants to secure his future and the future of his children/grandchildren. I am bringing these deals to you first, Sal before giving them away. <br>By the way, the NY city construction projects are going on pretty well so far; we’ll see!<br>        </p>

          Fulga <br><br>Give this one away. Its not for anyone I know. Actually, be careful because a lot of fraud happens with these deals. I wouldn&#39;t be pitching these deals really. Here&#39;s usually how they blow up and rip off unsuspecting investors. I&#39;ve seen this so many times in oil and this is the same way. <br><br>First,  you find a giant patch of dirt with no oil in it, have your engineers declare a trillion or two in recoverable reserves, issue stock against that valuation, sell enough stock to buy yourself a new Bentley, Rolls Royce and a Gulfstream V jet. Then you buy a few drill rigs for show, syphon a few hundred billion to the cayman&#39;s, reassess your trillion dollar fields and realize there&#39;s no oil, and poof... File Chapter 7. <br><br>Same with minerals. I know, I know, your deal is great. But they all follow the same script. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Where *exactly* are you with the NYC deal. Has it been papered yet? <br><br>         </p>

          Fulga,<br>I&#39;ve seen a lot of these deals lately. They all seem to talk about revenues yet when you ask certain questions, you always get the same answers which are, we just started drilling or mining, were in beginning stages, we&#39;ve spent a lot of money on dd and land studies, feasibility studies, etc.<br><br>Many of these are small companies and the question I always pose is, if this land and it&#39;s tracts are so heavy with the commodity being mined for, how come the larger players with larger capital resources don&#39;t know about it. The old saying of they aren&#39;t making any more land comes into play.<br><br>The other question posed always is how much additional money can fit into the capital stack and where do you want us comes into play as in any deal.<br><br>The usual answer is we need 100% funding. The answer to that is not going to happen. If they had the funds to do these expensive studies why do they not have any equity to put in?<br><br>Why do I see these deals? Because I&#39;m in Dallas and Fort Worth, home of many of these companies and they all want huge amounts of equity capital.<br><br>These deals are known as Dreams of fools because only unsophisticated people looking for the once in a life time Microsoft type score invest in these.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been looking at your blog The Term Sheet on the website and I read what has been posted so far on residential markets being no mans land. I wanted to post something interesting here for those in the community that believe that there are still opportunities. Here goes, and it&#39;s on the web...<br><br>B. Wayne Hughes is a name that many may not know as of yet and I mean yet. Ever hear of Public Storage? This is the company that Mr. Hughes founded many years ago. Okay James what does Public Storage have to do with single family residential? great question.<br><br>B. Wayne Hughes and his new company American Homes 4 Rent is an entity that has come in to the Dallas market and is buying up all and I mean all of the SFR&#39;s that are available and is controlling the rental market. He is not looking to steal people&#39;s homes and gain rock bottom pricing. He&#39;s not asking the age old question most investors ask which is If I buy your home and pay you cash, what is the lowest price you will accept. Why is he not looking for lowest price points?<br><br>He has a war chest of a Billion Dollars in cash. He is concerned with building a rental income portfolio and is in it for the long haul. What can he rent a three bedroom 2 bath home for is more compelling to him than what can I buy this home for.<br><br>Bad news for Dallas investors and this is just the first stop on his nationwide home buying tour. He knows that once sellers know he is in the market for homes and he is not looking for lowest prices, they call and they will call.<br><br>If your a home seller who is upside down and have zero equity or low equity and your choices are to call this guy who says I will buy your home at ask or near ask versus calling some investor who says I will pay you 50 cents on the dollar, who will the home seller call first?<br><br>Go on the new Dandrew Website and read the blogs on residential Sal is spot on when he says residential is no mans land.<br><br>If your trying to become a residential property investor, realize that once B. Wayne Hughes and guys like him arrive in your market, your power is going to erode and erode fast.<br><br>Want to play in the residential market, start a fund with deep pocketed investors and raise a war chest of cash, because that will be the only point of entry you will have, in residential.<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I got the new website to come up. I am shocked that today is Monday and no one has commented on the new website as of yet, so let me be the first.<br><br>This is the nicest website I have seen in our industry, hands down. I believe that this website as you said is a statement piece. <br><br>I am thrilled to be aligned with Dandrew and lif this is just the first of what is to come, than what lies ahead is what everyone should be excited about.<br><br>Well done, well, well done.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I think I&#39;m about to ask a question that may have never been asked before. Now while I don&#39;t have a deal firmed up, I have been asked about the potential of this deal that follows...<br><br>Very experienced sponsor operator, has done in excess of $40M in deals to date ranging from SFR to MF and some industrial as well. Here is what they want to do.<br><br>They want to buy LLC&#39;s that contain very strong cash flowing MF properties. They want to then sell off some of the properties and repay the debt stack within 12 to 18 months and the remaining properties would be portfolio&#39;d then sold at a later time to raise capital for additional investments in some higher risk ventures.<br><br>They have 35% equity in capital reserves that they would be willing to block into escrow. If their available equity is not enough, they can partner with another entity who would go onto the deal and the loan with them. They also have some additional assets they can pledge to cross collateralize. They mentioned a free and clear citation plane and I said that it must be real estate. I told them planes go down in value every hour they fly and the market for planes isn&#39;t exactly robust if my capital provider had to try and liquidate.<br><br>Any initial thoughts?<br><br>        </p>

          They said that they own several unencumbered assets such as this Citation 10 private jet that they own. The escrow thing came from them. They are willing to block the funds into an escrow account so that the money is held aside.        </p>

          James, <br><br>Nothing says that your sponsor has no conviction in his or her own business than putting funds into escrow. <br><br>Insitutions like us don&#39;t like that kind of arrangement, because those funds can be hard to get to, yes, even in escrow. <br><br>In general, why don&#39;t they take some, throw it in as their equity in the deal, and then they get paid *pari pasu* (read (&quot;Even Steven&quot;) on the take out or sale event? <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Hope all is well. I have been posting some on LinkedIn. Anyway- I say I am direct to hedge fund. Is this the right verbiage to use? Some of responses do not believe it as they say that hedge funds can find their own tapes. I then say MAYBE- BUT in this case they are too busy doing capital raises and other things so why not delegate this to guys like me and others???? That is that. I believe this is it... LinkedIn is not the best place to find deals but a great way to build some relationships to do deals outside of LinkedIN. Thanks!!!<br>        </p>

          Richard, I just tell them that my firm is backed by a  large fund that provides capital to do my deals. I never use the term Hedge Fund because many people don&#39;t really understand what a hedge fund does anyway.        </p>

          Richard, I agree to an extent about Linked In. Not the best place to find a deal but great to network. I have 2009 connections, all deal makers, but it comes down to informing them of what we do.<br><br>If you look at the summaries on potential connections, they all mainly say the same or near same thing. You have to stand out in what you say in your summary section.        </p>

          Sal, <br>They hid from me the fact that they wanted us to buy this, not lend on it. I&#39;m going to put my head into the oven now. They called me at 10 pm last night and said why do you need this information meaning the 5 data points and I said because we need this to determine If we want to provide debt on this and he said, wait, you are capital guys, I said yes, sometimes were debt and sometimes were equity.<br><br>He said oh I am the owner of the property, I&#39;m looking to off load this. I said, we don&#39;t buy things we lend on them through our capital provider, which is a large fund.        </p>

          During the most recent conference call. A large part of the discussion centered around the 3 income streams generated from a Commercial Real Estate Deal. My question is does the Intermediary ( me) have to pay for the Sponsor out of the money we collect in the three income streams??<br>&gt;I heard that a good sponsor can be found by me putting the word out at LinkedIn. If that is my responsibility, I think I have to contract and pay the sponsor??<br>&gt;<br>&gt;================================<br>Hello : Based on the last conference call, I have a question : Please see above. Thank you.        </p>

          Rocky, your making things too technical. I understand your getting back into the game. The strategies have not changed per se , just the markets. As far as paying people who you enlist onto your team in a deal, yes your going to have to pay them.<br><br>Your not paying the sponsor, it&#39;s these folks who are the beneficiary of the loan funds. The sponsor is the operator of the property.        </p>

          Sal, here is what I have right now and I&#39;m working on getting the deal together. A hotel in Dallas is expanding and has already acquired a vacant property directly across the street. They&#39;ve begun demo work already. Behind the newly acquired property sits a vacant parking structure, they said I believe is four stories.<br><br>They want to acquire the structure, and are looking at possibly taking an acquisition loan. My intern knows the owner of the hotel personally. He went to SMU with the owners son.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was approached by a CFO of an investment firm in Atlanta that buys SFR&#39;s from banks in portfolios and they resell the entire portfolios. They employee  the buy low and mark up a bit to make a profit, which gives them some pricing fluctuation capabilities.<br><br>They are looking for a source who can buy these deals from them. They make their profits in volume, not one shot deals. They understand what were looking for.<br><br>They were so excited to be connected that they had someone they know send me a portfolio of 17 SFR&#39;s in Texas, $2.4M dollar value, all rented, minimum asset value $85K up into the $200K neighborhood. $26K per month in rent flow.<br><br>The buyer they were working with is out of capital. Before I send the deals, I want to make sure it&#39;s T&#39;d up for you.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal, the seller of the SFR&#39;s is trying to play a game of cat and mouse with me on this. They cannot come to the conclusion of their pricing expectations. I was very nice and very professional and simply said, without pricing expectations we simply are not going to be able to bid on your portfolio. I also reiterated that we would not be a bid on anything under 60K. They are without a doubt a mom and pop seller.<br><br>I wanted to update you on this. I have also received another portfolio in the neighborhood of about $4.7 million and I am waiting on their pricing expectations.<br><br>I am feeling as you may be on this that this is not going to be able to be bid on, I will see where they stand on Monday and advise.        </p>

          Sal,<br>My intern and I got together last week and we decided that in order to move forward and be more productive in our deal flow sourcing, we need to target our marketing to those sources outside of private sellers who are really mom and pops who have product but are unsophisticated.<br><br>We&#39;ve seen deals from these types of sellers that do to know their pricing expectations or are wanting par for product that is rough.<br><br>My intern began reaching out to a clientele that is more sophisticated and are actual investment firms such as the bulk buyers in Atlanta. We are learning however that not all investment firms who are deemed sophisticated are not really that.        </p>

          Good strategy. Love it. <br>The mom and pops don’t understand the market really, the look at things very myopically, to say the lease. Somewhere they buy these assets and never realize what the market is paying for these. Then the market beats them up, realizes that your not a vulture and then comes back to you. <br><br>Time and circumstance will change all mom and pop buyer’s minds at some point. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Rocky, when you do it the way Sal says to with regard to the FDIC site, you have the choice of over $1B and 1B and under. I focus on banks under $1B which us what Sal says to do.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been seeing the name CrePig show up here a few times and wanted to provide some insight on it. Crepig is not a deal site or a site for anything meaningful.<br><br>The deals you will come across will always have send POF and LOI attached to it. You will ask for information to be sent and never receive it, ask me how I know, well I will tell you.<br><br>As a test, I replied to someone. I introduced myself, talked about what I do, my experience level and then started to talk various cocktail terms and zero reply and zero information. I informed the person that I needed specific information.<br><br>When I looked at the same posting again, I noticed that others received the deal. I noticed that they were nothing more than brokers who knew nothing. I realized that the poster knew he was not going to easily get a deal done through an experienced person.<br><br>Your going to spin your wheels and get nowhere fast.        </p>

          Sal,<br>If you were starting all over again and you started with a deal flow and wanted to hire an intern, how would you pay them? would it be a salary plus incentives, a % of deal fees? what are your recommendations?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Generally speaking, interns don’t really get paid. However, over the past few years some have been getting paid from larger firms. Now you’re not a larger firm. Legendary Intern Peter Kasyanenko put together a very robust and comprehensive system called Intern Intel Private Coaching Series. It is one of the crowd favorites. To learn more about that, go to here: <br>  <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathnifeu <br><br>The way you want to do this is give them pieces of the deal that close. They are learning the business  - and there are very few finance or business majors who *don’t* want to learn this business – in exchange for college credit and experience. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          James: <br><br>Catch-ups are more prevalent in the opportunity fund (value added) sector. This is a defined split of profits that go to the investor and fund sponsor. A high catch-up split would be 80/20 that is 80 percent to the fund sponsor and 20 percent to the investor until such time as the sponsor has received its 20 percent return on overall profits. Even though the catch-up mechanism<br>would normally kick in at the preferred return – for example, 9 percent – it would mean that for every dollar of profit over and above the 9 percent return, the fund sponsor would get 80 cents until the sponsor has received its 20 percent return on overall profit. <br><br>Now this has changed a bit since 2008, but as is everything with these types of opportunistic funds, everything is negotiable. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a question regarding recurring deals where your buying from same seller multiple times. Let&#39;s say in the case of the pool your looking at that I sent over and you buy it and I earn let&#39;s say a 2% fee. Let&#39;s say you buy another deal from same seller the following month, who determines the IM&#39;s fee on each subsequent deal?<br><br>Or is it a case where they come to me and say would your fund buy again, then that deal generates a fee that I decide upon?        </p>

I thought I would see what your thoughts are.<br><br>Class A Office Building, $29.15 Million firm in Silicon Valley. $2M rent roll annually. 8 tenants, nationally recognized brand name anchor tenant. Completely renovated in January of this year.<br><br>This is a value-add opportunity. Recent income bump due to rent increases. Now, what would make this a value-add opportunity?

          James: <br><br>Rent increases are a catch 22. I wouldn’t go into this thinking you can increase rents arbitrarily, after all many a mult-family newbie thought they could raise rates. If the market resists, you’ll get killed. <br><br>In retail, these rents generally need to be disclosed prior usually though rent escalation clauses. The market isn’t too kind to rent increases today, so I would say this isn’t a meaningful value-added play. <br><br>And neither is reducing expenses, for that matter…<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just received a new deal from the same seller for the 5 note deal I believe your working on. Now this is a single note, NPN on a 40 unit MF in St. Louis, secured by a $912,000.00 first mortgage.<br><br>The question I have is this. Would a deal like this be attractive because the asset is a multi family as opposed to a SFR? I know this is a small deal and not really what would fit into Dandrew&#39;s criteria.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I went out and secured a domain name under jbcapital.ws. I setup emails for that domain as follows...<br>jb@jbcapital.ws, deals@jbcapital.ws, and info@jbcapital.ws., can you suggest any additional one&#39;s that I&#39;m not thinking about? I took your advice and got away from the gmail stuff.<br><br>Also, is it better to have a toll free number in addition to a local number? I am ramping up to really start acquiring and implementing the credibility tools, seeing that I have really begun seeing alot of deal flow.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to pass on something to the members that you have went out of the way to reinforce in getting my thinking to come full circle on the subject of risk.<br><br>Here goes. It&#39;s so easy to want a deal to be real, to put the cart before the horse, I do it, it&#39;s something that I&#39;m working on. Sal has told me just because something looks like a deal, doesn&#39;t make it so.<br><br>Pragmatically speaking, a deal really isn&#39;t a deal until the deal is scrutinized, has gone through due diligence and terms are created and agreed to and then you can say it&#39;s a deal. Until that time, it&#39;s an opportunity that needs to prove out.<br><br>You have to look at the risks. This is prudent business. It&#39;s so easy to look at the financial rewards first because you want to get paid. <br><br>Everyone wants the big score, the huge fees, etc. This is why the players like Blackstone for example focus on the larger deals. Why they undertake capital raises to create a two billion dollar fund. They are building a financial war chest so they can buy those $250 million dollar deals and up, or the myriad of ninety million dollar resort deals, etc.<br><br>It&#39;s easy to bypass risk because as an Intermediary, you have no risk in a transaction because your not writing the check. Your risk is the time your investing at the front end and the only thing you risk is losing a payday and maybe a equity piece on the back end. The funder risks losing their capital, their credibility, etc. People never remember the great deals you do, they remember the bad deals.<br><br>You have to ask yourself what can possibly go wrong if my capital provider gets into this deal and it goes south at any point in time during the term of the deal. On a funding deal, what can go wrong at 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, the day before the term ends. On a syndicated deal, what happens if the sponsor pulls the trigger on a bad decision, are the investors going to have to do a capital call and put more equity in, just to make the deal whole, etc.<br><br>For a fund such as Dandrew, it&#39;s more than just capital. It&#39;s reputations, credibility, future abilities to gain the trust of investors to place monies again, investors monies, pension funds monies. This is why Sal and Dandrew just do not buy every deal. It&#39;s more than just deploying capital. Money has two voices and two tolerance levels, pleasure and pain.<br><br>When life in the deal is great, money is happy, it&#39;s growing, it&#39;s generating rates of return, it&#39;s generating cash on cash returns, etc. When life in a deal is not so great, money voices it&#39;s displeasure with those who had their hands on it. It&#39;s like a woman who is scorned and it gets even in ways that no one wants to be privy to.<br><br>Sal tells us all, just locate the deal, qualify it through the five data points, put together the package, and send it to him. The only one who can speak for Dandrew is Sal and AJ. Let them model the opportunity and make the determination if the risk is worth them buying the deal.<br><br>Funds like Dandrew have complex software programs that enables them to see all the risks, often risk categories we have never heard of.<br><br>Always treat Dandrew&#39;s money as if it were yours. Be Sals Pal and look at risk first, reward second because at the end of the day, if the risks can not be properly evaluated and risk strategies arrived at and implemented, then there will be no rewards for anyone.<br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just keep getting these massive deals on what seems like a daily basis. I have been presented with a huge deal. It is for $856M in loans. <br><br>I am questioning the deal because they&#39;ve presented a offering of Memorandum. This seems like more of a capital raise or syndication deal.<br><br>I remember that recently you replied to someone here and said sometimes these deals, even at the massive dollar volumes are actually very real.<br><br>On a deal like this, if it was analyzed and determined to be a real deal, how would a deal like this be structured? would Dandrew syndicate this deal or would it be structured where a larger fund partners with Dandrew?        </p>

          James. <br><br>In this case, the burden of proof is on you to prove to me why you think this $1 billion deal is legit. <br><br>We&#39;re smaller balance players; the reason is becuase that is where we are the biggest fish in the pool. Why does this person need you and not Goldman Sachs to move this trade? <br><br>So before you ask us questions on a hypothetical basis, why you feel as though this is legitimate enough to talk about? Did you peel back any layers of the onion yet? <br><br>Why Due Diligence did you do before merely placing a question here? I don&#39;t see anything of substance here. No meat to chew on. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I actually have looked at the Offering Memorandum. I was asking really as a chance to get some insight from you as to how a O.O.M. correlates into this being an offer from a seller of product to sell already existing inventory in their house as opposed to someone looking to either establish a fund to acquire these large pools or syndicate some capital to buy assets.<br><br>I have not looked at many O.M.&#39;s only because I have not been presented with one. My thinking is that I can make performance and incentive fees for each investor I bring to this deal, sort of as if I bought an accredited investor to a Dandrew Fund.<br><br>I really need to look at this and its merit.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Would you consider doing a continuing ed on deals that are no good? Where I&#39;m coming from is this. I think the members could gain a better understanding of what makes a deal a pass, what goes into analyzing a deal that ultimately becomes a pass.        </p>

          James <br><br>*Specificity gets you funded* but it also gets you a better educational experience. <br><br>Now you&#39;ve asked a lot of open-ended questions which I have spent a lot of time on, but this one would require months. <br><br>So instead of saying no, be more specific. I know all of you think I probably don&#39;t do anything all day but be attentive on AskDandrew, but please be more thoughful when putting these requests together. What specifically do you want to know. Rather than putting together a highlight reel of crappy deal submissions. <br><br>I don&#39;t think that is time well spent, do you? <br><br>What are you looking for that I&#39;ve not *already have shown you*. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Actually here is what prompted me to suggest this. Two weeks ago there was that exchange between Fulga and yourself and I chimed in with my four and a half cents and I caught a bit of flack.<br><br>Molly replied and said that members just wanted to get a better understanding of what causes deals to lose traction in the initial preliminary analysis once a deal is deemed to be worth taking a look at.<br><br>I am paraphrasing her comments because truthfully I don&#39;t remember them. I too recently have had some deals lose traction, well truthfully they never gained any, so I was thinking, wouldn&#39;t it be a good educational tool for those submitting deals to understand what causes a deal to lose traction, what are the factors that come out in the wash so to speak, that would make you say, you know, this is not going to be a pass.<br><br>I think that most have never been in the war room so to speak where analysts are actually looking at a deal, discussing it and figuring out how to underwrite the deal.<br><br>I enjoy everything you do, and I will be the first to tell anyone that working with you is for me, the best choice I ever made.        </p>

          Sal,<br>This is not really deal related but more for educational purposes. Just as your wife has you watching that hotel turnaround show, my kids have me watching Shark Tank.<br><br>The one shark who stands out is Kevin O&#39;Leary, the Venture Capitalist. I&#39;ve known many VC&#39;s from my days in the street and they don&#39;t invest in small ventures.<br><br>Why would a guy who is a fund manager such as O&#39;Leary invest in mom and pop businesses? what is the attraction of trying to scale a business that generates $50,000.00 a year into a multi million dollar entity?<br><br>Also, if I walk into the Shark Tank and I ask for $200,000.00 for a 10% equity interest in my business! I&#39;m obviously valuing my business at $2,000,000.00 and that value is not where my business is at valuation wise, how can accepting an offer of $200,000.00 and giving up 40% equity take my business from not being worth $2,000,000.00 to all of a sudden being worth substantially more?        </p>

          Sall,<br>I was approached by a bank and right now I don&#39;t want to put the cart before the horse and say who they are, they said they want to sell their entire portfolio, everything, and he confided that they are already in trouble, very deep and they no longer want to make mortgage loans, they want to convert to a small business bank and divest themselves out if what they have.<br><br>I asked the size of the pool and he said over $200M. He said they would be willing to sell in tranches over a negotiated time frame until everything is liquidated.<br><br>I&#39;ve handled it this way. I said the fund I&#39;m backed by is very real, so much more real than most you&#39;ll come into contact with that they use very specific tools that enable them to see into a banks standing (I was referring to the FDIC tool), that they are principal bids, that they are liquid, and that before I even move to determine their interest, I need a Bio on all the principals, a overview of exactly what their portfolio consists of in terms of loans, types, volumes, % of P, RP, NP, etc.<br><br>I told him that were only going to bid on real estate secured loans, not loans secured by retail businesses, equipment leases, etc. Were not going to be a player in any other space but real estate secured loans and Bulk REO.<br><br>I then suggested that he assemble a portfolio of his scratch and dent loans seperate, because we could possibly be interested in saving them the headache and unnecessary hassles of filing the legals and at best case scenario end up with even more negatives on the file which will lower their credit standing with the fed and make the cost of money more expensive for them.<br><br>I will keep you in the loop.        </p>

          Agreed. Get the tape.

          Sal, <br> I am simply just doing what you have taught us to do. I air on the side of caution.  You have taught me that it is important to dot your I&#39;s and cross your T&#39;s.<br><br>You have taught us all that it is extremely important to be direct, to know your deal, know the players and the inner workings of the deal and not the country music love song.<br><br>I am ready to do this, if it is real. I am simply going to provide them with a list of the information we need to see on a excel spreadsheet, and have them assemble the information.<br><br>I am not going to take on the liability of putting together the tape. I always heed your warnings. <br><br>        </p>

          James: <br><br>First, good for you for having month end meetings. That is important. <br><br>Second, the answer to your markets question is not a straight forward one. <br><br>On one hand you’re fortunate to live in one of the best pro-business, pro-landlord, pro-investment, fastest growing city in the United States. Everybody loves *urbanized* Texas and Dallas is the crown jewel in the Lone Star State. <br><br>So if you’re looking to syndicate money to buy assets, Dallas is a great place to start. You can attract money by doing that. <br> <br>If you’re crossing trades (Arb’ing) or financing deals (Banking), then no. You should look outside your home state. That is because you’re relying on us to do the due diligence and not yourself as its not your job or responsibility to go hard on costs to do things that must do anyway. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br>This is what you asked me to post about the Philadelphia 170 deal. I really appreciate the time you spent on this deal, going the extra mile for me.<br><br>I have advised the seller that this will more than likely be a pass. He&#39;s asked me to exhaust all sources. I have another outlet but they are going to want me to acquire first then sell to them. Not sure why.<br><br>I was very direct in a non confrontational way and I said I know you have better product, your trying to sling crap my way to see what I can do. He finally said I have a portfolio in a Myrtle Beach, I&#39;m going to send and no one else has it. He was holding up to capitalize on the interest gain until June.<br><br>He said every asset is above $60K, all waterfront properties and he is the owner of these assets and can sign all docs. He said we can cherry pick what we want and the rest he will hold into for income. He said he is not pulling the good stuff for himself, and as I put it, slinging crap.<br><br>Anyway, the new deal came in, all the assets are above $200K in value, so I&#39;m going to take a look at it. A few side notes to clarify a few things.<br><br>This is the same seller that sent me the Canton 68 and the Philly 170, all rough assets. I was told at the beginning that he gets really good stuff all the time. I spent a fair amount of time in conversations with this seller and continually stated all assets must be at $60K in value, and I wanted to be firm with him.<br><br>I don&#39;t make it a practice to rough people up verbally and am not a proponent of it. I don&#39;t want my firm to gain a reputation of being a loopnet type deal clearing house.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve just printed your reply. I&#39;m going to use it. I had to adjust my ways between going from banker to PE. When I was at banker level, I said just send me the deal and I will take a look at it, not realizing what I was setting into motion.<br><br>I got a deal in and I never sent it or told you about it. It was to fund a closed down quarry that the sponsor wanted to convert to a recreational facility where people bungee jumped.<br><br>Zero experience, 3.5 % to put down! zero money to buy equipment! and this deal came in because I said just send it! it took me a lot to not laugh when I said it was a pass.<br><br>I listen to everything you say and I am learning a lot everyday.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to put this out there for the community to read. It&#39;s more for motivation. In the past 4 weeks or so, I&#39;ve submitted I think just about $26,000,000.00 in deals and I&#39;ve yet to submit a Mobile home park acquisition deal at $13,750,000.00, the deal package for 12 multi families in Dallas at $9,950,000.00 and the package on the $29,000,000.00 class A office building.<br><br>Why am I mentioning this? Not to brag, but rather to show that if you just do what Sal and Dandrew tell you to do, if you ask questions, if you don&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel and you network with those that share an alignment of interests, you can be successful.<br><br>Now will Sal buy every deal or fund every deal? No, but if you refuse to fall out when Sal says it&#39;s a pass and you keep plugging along, you will get a deal done.<br><br>Think of it this way. If Sal buys a deal and you make $100K or even $30K as a fee, not many people get that kind if money in their hands at any given time in life. If you spent 5 hours on that deal for that fee, how much money did you make per hour?<br><br>Now do one more deal a year, even part time and you will have uncovered the power of this business and why so many gravitate to the world of high finance.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I will admit to everyone here that I&#39;m guilty of sending some rough deals over to you, and I was thinking about how this could be a lesson in itself and help those still searching for their first deal.<br><br>What factors come into play that lead to the determination that certain assets are considered rough. Let me clarify for everyone here that rough does not necessarily mean properties that are run down or are in questionable areas.<br><br>This is a question coming more from the financial side such as basis, etc.        </p>

          James<br><br>Very good question again. <br><br>*1. Performing Notes:*<br>*Yield* is what investors want. So this is why they bid down as compared to the face value of the note. The lower the bid, the higher the yield. *Basis* is not so much of an issue with *performing* notes. <br><br>*2. Non-Performing Notes:*<br>Basis. The lower the better. No yield so you’re buying this for control of the asset, not so much yield. And this is a function of costs and time to foreclose. <br><br>*3. REOs*<br>*Basis.* Some folks will tell you that they will pool and say it throws off a cap rate or NOI, but most *sophisticated (aka institutional) investors* will look at the basis only.  If you’re talking to *retail investors* they are less sophisticated and will look at the rental cash flow, which in my opinion isn’t an accurate way to look at this product. <br><br>Keep up the good work. <br>Sal        </p>

          James: <br><br>Why does he use it? <br><br>What does he think you would want to use it for? <br><br>We don’t use this (as the *Buyer*) as we use ClearCapital to do BPOs for us. We need to use objective 3rd parties for these, Google Earth isn’t regularly updated and if a trade goes wrong, we need to hold someone accountable. <br><br>Case in point, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, some homes had notes that were actually – performing. On Google Earth the structure was still standing. <br><br>*But when the BPOs came back, it was under water*. <br><br><br>The Seller (a bank) tried to tell us there was still as structure there. <br><br>As an Intermediary arbitraging these deals, *you should not be looking at Google Earth images as it’s a waste of time, and we’re going to get BPOs anyway.*<br><br>So the only reason he said this was probably because he thought you were a buyer or doesn’t understand how institutional buyers operate in this business. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Well, I told him about the Philly deal and I think he was suggesting its use as a means of looking at the assets first so I&#39;m more in tune with the deal and better prepared to know what the deal looks like, just as a barometer of sorts.<br><br>I don&#39;t use it and really don&#39;t like it.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Thank you for the time you spent on ten Philadelphia 170 Deal. I have advised the seller that this will most likely be a pass. He&#39;s asking me to exhaust all sources. I have another outlet but they are going to want me to acquire first then sell to them, not sure why.<br><br>I was very direct in a non confrontational way and said I know you have better product, your trying to sling crap my way to see what I can do. He finally said I have a portfolio in Myrtle Beach I&#39;m going to send and no one else has it. He was holding up to capitalize in on the interest gain until June.<br><br>He said every asset is above $60K, all waterfront properties and he is the owner if these assets and can sign all sale docs. He said we can cherry pick what we want and the rest he will just hold onto for income. He Saudi he is not pulling the good stuff fir himself, and as I put it, slinging crap.<br><br>I am not going to send this until I am sure we have something here. My goal is to make money and reinvest some back into getting the Bulk Financier Program, spend a day at Dandrew even if it costs $15K, to me it&#39;s a great investment in myself, and to get all the tools you make available, the credibility kit, the trading desk service, etc.<br><br>This is what I am going to do forever, this is why I&#39;m constantly asking questions, constantly working day and night, reading all the trade papers and journals, studying various funds and how they structure deals. I&#39;m 1000% dedicated to this and failure is not an option.<br><br>I never shared the following with anyone but I will with you. My wife is very ill. She has had two heart attacks and a stroke. She has type 2 diebetes and diebetic neuropathy. Most of my life savings has gone to medical bills. I sold a home I owned in Denton, Tx valued at $550,000.00 and downsized so I could get ahead in bills and shed some debt and this is why I upgraded to the PE program, so I could take advantage if every opportunity to make money.<br><br>This us why I work so hard right now, so I can make my wife&#39;s life easier and I know this business takes a lot of work but I&#39;m willing to do what is needed. I&#39;m making some errors in deal judgement and I appreciate you hanging with me when it would be easier to just kick me to the curb.<br><br>Anyway, the new deal just came in, all the assets are above $200K in value, so I&#39;m going to take a look at it.        </p>

          Sal,<br>One of the most successful note investors in the business has elected to sell off some of his inventory. He hardly ever does this. He wants to acquire a larger pool and will be reinvesting new money into it.<br><br>He has essentially said, tell me what your looking for and I can almost guarantee that I have it. He is very astute, understands the business very well.<br><br>I have emailed him and informed him of what we are looking for. I am also thinking that he could be a great candidate for a credit facility program. <br><br>I will let you know who he is once I see a tape from him. This guy is the Josh Cantwell of the note business. This could be the turning point for my business. I already have a relationship with him because I had a small pool that would have never met Dandrew&#39;s criteria and he was set to get into the deal when the seller decided to go another route on the deal.<br><br>I will keep you in the loop.<br><br>James        </p>

          Ah. Great question. <br><br>*Retail Investors* (aka Ma’s-n-Pa’s) will pay par because they feel as though they are getting a good deal. These are usually the sales pitches from hard money lenders who will sell whole loans or partials to a group of doctors and dentists. The aforementioned doctors and dentists don’t know any better – about seasoning, etc. – and will gladly pay par because they see a face yield of 12-15%. <br><br>Institutional Investors (aka Smarter, More Sophisticated) have higher yield requirements and will pay less for the note to get a higher yield. <br><br>*The lower the price, the higher the yield.* <br><br>*Institutional Investors* also are more sophisticated to buy and bid from banks where the average Retail Investors can’t and won’t.         </p>

          Sal,<br>I may have asked this previously and forgive me I did but don&#39;t remember and am asking again. A gentlemen I have known a long time, has many banking connections. He is a former industrialist that my father in law and I play golf with.<br><br>He is in the as he puts it, the connection business. He called me today and said remember you mentioned your looking to connect directly with banks and I said yes, he said I have 35 bankers right now that I&#39;ve known for years, I can give you their name, phone number and vice-versa and you strike your own deal.<br><br>He said he gets paid by them. He has no say in any deals, doesn&#39;t hand deals off, engineers nothing. If a successful deal is done, they renumerate him.<br><br>Is this considered a broker deal?        </p>

          Intermediary would get a pre-determined % of what is brought to us. <br><br>No Pakistani investors. They are on the US &quot;no-fly zone&quot;. Dubai is OK. <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I realize we have a lot of new People here who may be reading the posts, your replies and may be wondering if they are in over the heads. I wanted to share the things I&#39;ve learned in my time here.<br><br>First, if your new, welcome. Welcome to what is hands down the best opportunity in our industry and yes, were an industry that has been around for centuries. <br><br>This is a business where you will be a life long student, because there are so many avenues for making money and so many strategies within each of those opportunities. You will certainly get a lot of intellectual capital from your relationship with Dandrew.<br><br>The one thing I can say is that Sal is not the only educator/guru in the business, there are many, but none better. Sal tells you the truth and if he has to lean on you or slap you around, well not literally of course to make his point, he will. He wants everyone to do well, he has said that.<br><br>Sal and AJ work long hours to make tools available that are real world, not the pie in the sky crap others are rehashing and selling that didn&#39;t work ten years ago, five years ago and never will.<br><br>I have found that with Dandrew, you get back what you put in. This is an action business and one of relationships. Without relationships, your never going to get off the ground. Without action, you&#39;ll never get off the ground either.<br><br>I hear from many on a regular basis things such as, I setup a Linkedin page, I have 100 connections but no one is knocking down my door to send me deals or I setup a Twitter page and all I get is friend requests from Hooters Girls.<br><br>Pick those you do business with based upon whether they can actually bring you deals, whether they will have an alignment of interests. If your looking to do Bulk REO deals, your Linkedin page must have connections to those that are in that segment of our industry. If your a banker, your connections need to be with real estate brokers, hard money lenders, commercial property owners, etc. <br><br>Also come to learn exactly what Dandrew does, what their core businesses are, because if you have no intention of having anyone other than Dandrew as your capital provider, you will want to send only those deals that you can get funded. <br><br>Case in point, a lot of development deals seem to make their way here, Dandrew does not fund these. Why would you spin your wheels getting info on a deal that your capital provider will never do when you can spend the same level of time getting info on a deal that your capital provider does all the time.<br><br>I&#39;ve learned in my time here that Sal is not in the junk business. What I mean by this is that they have no interest in looking at and funding deals that are mediocre at best. Look at it this way, the same amount if time goes into a $2,000,000.00 deal, a $20,000,000.00 deal as does a $500,000.00 deal. A pristine stabilized deal as a less than good deal, so where do you think Dandrew&#39;s interest lies???<br><br>The biggest two things I&#39;ve learned is to think like an investor and look at risk first and to ask myself, if I were looking to park my own funds into a deal, would this deal be the one. If it&#39;s too much risk and not enough reward for someone with little to no money, what makes you think the risk and rewards levels will be any different for those with capital?<br><br>Your in the right place at the right time  to really do well in life, how well you do depends upon you.        </p>

          Sal,<br>After looking at Fulga&#39;s posting about the luxury homes in Colorado, I begun doing a search of pension funds who invested in the ultra high end home development opportunities in Colorado. Why I chose Pension Funds? It just came to mind.<br><br>I was quite surprised to find that the Dallas Police and Fire Fighters Pension Fund that has $9.4 Billion under management, invested $400 Million in a development in Colorado in 2008 and 6 years later, they have a zero ROI and they did this a second time in Arizona with near same results.<br><br>How can we make a play here on something like this? I think we could bring value in some capacity, just not sure how we could.        </p>

          James<br><br>there is a lot of fraud that goes into these &quot;sucker deals&quot;. <br><br>I don&#39;t know what the play is.

          Sal,<br>I was approached two days ago to buy a portfolio of 12 multi family properties in Dallas, Texas that needs work and repositioning. It&#39;s a value add opportunity. All twelve properties for $9,500,000.00 being sold by a private seller and it&#39;s off market. It&#39;s has a double digit cap rate.<br><br>Currently it has a NOI of just north iif $440K and a pro forma of just north of $770K but I believe that if repositioned properly, the pro forma NOI could be raised to about $900K.<br><br>I&#39;m going to leverage my intellectual capital into a consulting gig. The real estate broker is doing this for 3% commission because I think they have had a long term relationship. I have not had to do any heavy lifting on this so I&#39;m thinking a flat rate fee of 2 points for bringing an experienced sponsor operator to the table and then orchestrating the funding for the sponsor operator through Dandrew.<br><br>How I want to structure the compensation and the deal is as follows.<br><br>Flat fee commission for locating buyer and creating funding strategy: 2 points<br><br>Funding fee commission: Charge 1 point<br><br>Equity position on the back end:  5 percent.<br><br>Take three of the buildings and create a condo conversion opportunity, creating a selling opportunity for the buyer of the twelve properties where they sell the units and use that money to retire the capital stack. The three properties would be the ones that will generate the least in rental income, even if they are renovated. This would be capitalizing in the highest and best use strategy.<br><br>Any thoughts?<br>        </p>

        <p>
          Sal, something that comes to mind and this may be an aggressive strategy here, but what about doing a master lease on all 12 properties commingled with a seperate agreement as an option to buy in 12 months. The master lease would require me to manage the deal and pay the lease holder one payment per month. They make what they would anyway in terms of income without the hassles of managing and the expenses. I would hire a management company to do the hands on.<br><br>My thinking is that I can go in, reposition them and get them stabilized. I can prep the condo conversion and since the three are by Baylor Hospital, sell them off to Baylor Hospital who can come in and finish out the conversion to medical condos.<br><br>Use the funds from selling off to the hospital to pull the trigger on the option, complete the acquisition and refinance to pay down any remaining debts and pull some capital out to add to my retirement fund.<br><br>Any thoughts?        </p>

          I think you should just get the info first and not engineer this too crazy and see what we have here. <br><br>Keep it simple at first. Only complex deals require complex structures. <br><br>We&#39;ll get to that point. But lets not put the cart in front of the horse yet. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hello Sal &amp; AJ,<br>For the first time, someone has entered information on my banker’s website through the PLN page wanting to invest $10,000 for 1 year.  I’ve never had an inquiry through PLN before so I don’t know how to address this with the potential investor.  Please advise.  Thanks for all the help and education.  <br>        </p>

          Dave, <br><br>This is great. However, $10,000 isn’t enough to do *anything* with. But you should keep in in mind for when larger deals come down, you can patch together his $10,000 with others. <br><br>I just want you to make bigger money, that’s all! But I guess you have seen for yourself that the <br>www.PrivateBankerIdentityKit.com *works*.  <br><br>This is good news for you, your business and your overall confidence. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>To me it looks like the PLN portion is to combine capital from various retail investors to ultimately use for syndication for a particular commercial deal.  If this is correct, I’d ask what’s the best utilization of the site as far as marketing to find investors,  how to find choice properties to syndicate, &amp; how to respond to investors that say they want to invest a particular amount like the couple that filled out the form on my site - $10,000 for 1 year.   To me it’s the chicken or the egg – find a property &amp; then market the PLN, or market the PLN to find investors and then find a property.    Or, I may be way off base here.  <br><br>        </p>

          Dave<br><br>There are many ways you can generate revenue from this. And, because I am your mentor, I will tell you *the #1 mistake that all investors make is to find a deal first*, and then scramble to find investors. That is a 1st Class ticket to frustration, broken dreams and discouragement. <br><br>The reason why we can do even more deal types than we care to advertise is because I have relationship with investors that are “axed” for certain deal types and if they fit, the get closed. <br><br>So this is a resource that you should continue to keep in touch with, cultivate, build and then utilize these investors any one of these ways: <br><br>1.  Place them into someone else’s deal if you don’t have one. If you are a Hard Money Financier, we call this “brokering” and if you make 5 points on 100,000 that’s $5,000 (5 points on 10,000 is enough to buy a nice pair of shoes for your wife, but still, there is value here if you keep building the list). <br><br>2.  Sell the lead to Hard Money Lender(s). Yes, you can sell the lead more than 1x. As long as you disclose this. $50 for the name, $100 to take it off the market altogether so its exclusive (and make sure you hold to your word that you’re selling this exclusively otherwise, like they say, building trust is like a skyscraper, takes years to build, seconds to bring down). <br><br>3.  Place them into your own deals. If you are a Capital Syndicator, then you bank these names, send them your “What is a Syndication” Pitchbook, then when the deal comes, send them your “Deal Level” Pitchbook. <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br>I just got something that could be a deal and I will give you a brief overview. 12 Notes in California, all performing, all assets except one is above $60,000.00. The one that is below $60K is a busted Heloc, asset value dropped to $18K, payments being made to bankruptcy trustee outside of plan but is current.<br><br>Pricing expectation is 93% of UPB but I think we could get them down, I&#39;m not sending anything more on this to you until I get at the inner workings of the deal to see where they really are at.<br><br>Is this of interest to you?        </p>

          I will send the tape. I spent some time on this after dinner. Here is the figures.<br><br>Original Balances: $3,315,900.00<br>Current Balances:$ 2,179,212.00<br>Asset values (Through Appraisal) $7,326,000.00<br><br>I verified that this is direct from the seller, which is an investment corporation. They stated, we have all files and docs, can ready them for DD immediately.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting for the monthly payment amounts so we can get an idea if the cash flow figures. I will send the tape once I get these.  If you would like to bid on the sub $60K I&#39;m certain they would love to get rid of it. I don&#39;t really think they would mind selling 11 of 12 loans at one shot.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am aware that Dandrew buys loan pools and loans that are performing. You have also indicated twice in recent times that banks don&#39;t really have an incentive to liquidate these types of assets because the status if the loans are obviously current.<br>I have a bank in Fort Worth Texas they may want to liquidate some of these, what are the risks in buying these outside of the potential to no longer be performing. Also when you look at the risk, does the question ever come into play of, does the bank know something they are not sharing and when your scoring the pool do you give the pool a lower score to offset this potential key event?        </p>

          James: <br><br>First, this is not a *“key event”*. A key event is the event in commercial value-added deals that must happen for the deal to be a success. For example, a large NNN tenant signed on to a retail center. That is what the exit strategy is contingent upon. <br><br>Regarding the Texas maybe-soon-to-be-probably-will-be defaults, the largest function of pricing these are *costs required and time to foreclose*. <br><br>I think I answered this or something similar to these, but in Texas, and we love Texas, you can lasso their asses out in 21 days for non payment. If you have an attorney who is good. <br><br>So just keep that in mind. And now’s the time for this guys to move balance sheet because the longer it goes, the deeper the discount…<br><br>Sal        </p>

          I&#39;m glad I sent this. I never gave thought to what key event really means. I am meeting with the banks CFO tomorrow morning . I realize I probably will not walk out with a tape tomorrow but I will walk out with the beginnings of a relationship.        </p>

          Sal,<br>There are many of the PE&#39;s here that may not know that funds operate on a 2 and 20. This is as you and I know, 2% of fees and 20% of returns generated, both going to the fund for compensation, but could you elaborate if this is the industry standard or are there sometimes variations in this compensation formula?        </p>

          James<br><br>This is a great question<br><br>In the “JV Equity vs. Fund Structures” module, I discuss that not all investors pay rack rate. <br><br>For example, some investors pay less and some pay more. And the best analogy I can make is like buying an airline ticket to Las Vegas. <br><br>Let’s assume that all folks will fly coach coming to my event in Las Vegas from the same city. <br><br>The person in front of you will pay more than you did. The person next to you may pay less. <br><br>If Warren Buffet invested in my fund, he would want “0% &amp; 0%”; meaning he wouldn’t pay any fees or splits. But I would get to tell the world that Warren Buffet was an investor in my fund, which would bring more people in who would pay 2/20. <br><br>Sal<br><br><br>        </p>

          Aspen CO: Land at Ski Lodge, base of ski resort (“ski in/ski out/ 14 luxury properties”)<br><br>Everything about this deal is LOCATION: 3.5 square miles land at the famous Aspen CO ski lodge. The last piece of land in this area has recently become available and it is located at the base of the ski resort.<br>Sponsor wants to acquire the land and build 14 luxury homes, about 6,000 SqFt each.  After years of heavy fight with the building department (very difficult to get permits in that area), permits have been obtained.  The land is appraised at $38 mil, and the gross revenue estimated at about $200 mil. <br><br>Sponsor needs a JV to buy the land, with 100% financing, and in turn he is willing to provide equity as per lender’s terms. Once the land is purchased, sponsor will have no issue to raise the capital for construction. Developer Bio /Proforma will be provided if there is interest in this type of JV (100% financing with equity as per lender’s terms).<br>Here are the figures:<br>• Land acquisition: $35,000,000<br>• Total projected building cost: $68,162,600.00<br>• Total projected development cost: $103,162,600.00<br>• Projected sales price: $2,500.00 per square feet or $13,800,000.00 per home<br>• Total sales revenue: : $193,200,000.00<br>• Net: $72,649,000.00<br>• ROI: 70% or $50,854,580.00<br><br>Is Dandrew interested in this type of JV?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Fulga, why don&#39;t you become the JV Partner yourself? Use your intellectual capital to leverage your skill sets to captain the deal. Your intellectual capital has a value just as goodwill has a value in a business sale. Anyone can get a JV Partner who sits around like a puppet and brings no real value, how many people get a JV Partner who actually can do what you do, I do, etc.<br><br>Provide your services as a consultant in the deal, handling the heavy lifting for an equity piece on the back end. Prep the financial package for a $5,000.00 fee paid upfront.<br><br>Think you can&#39;t do it? don&#39;t forget, you have Sal to answer your questions here.         </p>

          Fulga,<br>Call Cooley LLP in Broomfield, Colorado at 720 566-4000, tell them you have this deal that needs a JV Partner in a Ski Resort. They are a law firm that has clients that are extremely wealthy, some I believe are motion picture actors and actresses, pro athletes, Fortune 500 CEO&#39;s who invest as passive investors and Cooley provides the legal in the deal.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I do a lot of meetings on the fly. On any given Monday or Thursday I can be found sitting at the Crescent Court Hotel in Dallas, sitting at Starbucks, meeting with people. For those that are in Dallas but may be unaware, The Crescent Court offices is home to about 85% of the Hedge Funds and Securities Attorneys offices in Dallas.<br><br>One of the subjects you&#39;ve taught us about is having an alignment of interests with whom we want to do business with. The question is how does one create this when it doesn&#39;t exist yet because a relationship is just forming.<br><br>I have found that everyone likes to talk about themselves, the deals they&#39;ve closed or the big deals they are doing. I am just as guilty of this and I think you once said that in your everyday business, which we don&#39;t all see, is that you constantly see this.<br><br>What I do and anyone here can do this. I research the heck out of the person I am meeting with. If I know they are an investment banker for a big firm with multiple offices, I will search The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, The Dallas Business Journal or the same publication from their area, their firms own website. I want intel on this person, why?<br><br>Because how impressive is it to sit there and be able to say, Congrats on your teams success with that deal in Miami or I see you orchestrated that credit facility with such and such in Philadelphia, tell me about it.<br><br>When you can make someone feel like you went the extra mile to find out about them, you give the impression that you want to really do business with them and when you bring them a deal they are known to work with, your creating an alignment of interests.<br><br>Of course there will always be that person who thinks your a suck up and may say no to doing any business at all.        </p>
