          We&#39;ve come to know you as a fund manager, but what kind of fund is the fund that you manage exactly?  Is it called an alternative investment fund or simply a real estate fund? Something else? How do we explain to more sophisticated Sponsors, the funding source that is backing us? <br><br>I listened to your recording this past weekend  - in it, you mentioned that you have an LPA with an insurance company, managed out of New York, that allows you to work in the $1mm - $10mm space at lower interest rates (6%). This would indicate that Dandrew partners is actively fundraising &amp; your partner in New York recently closed with a new LP - bringing us our newest product line. <br><br>The commercial lending aspect of my business (and other’s like mine) is really rooted in sourcing deal flow to keep your capital deployed and performing… Am I on track?         </p>

          Dave: <br><br>Its called a *discretionary real estate capital fund*. <br><br>And yes, you finally got it! We need the deal flow from you Intermediaries to keep the capital deployed and to show that one of our &quot;edges&quot; is we can generate deal sourcing (almost) on demand. <br><br>AJ is on vacation this week and he will be sending out an email for text alerts from NYC for all of our intermediaries to get our alerts. <br><br>I&#39;m so proud of you. Now find some deals! <br><br>Sal <br><br>        </p>

          Dave: <br><br>Again with the dissertation questions... <br><br>A share of any profits that the general partners of private equity and hedge funds receive as compensation, despite not contributing any initial funds. This method of compensation seeks to motivate the general partner (fund manager) to work toward improving the fund&#39;s performance. <br><br>For the reason why it&#39;s so &quot;controversial&quot; (and I don&#39;t think it is and neither will anyone like me you speak to), read this: <br><br>http://www.cnbc.com/id/101464832#.<br><br>        </p>

          Not really sure where to put this, but, Sal, you asked me to post a straw-man agenda for my &quot;Day with Sal&quot; in Vegas. I tried to steer clear of asking you to repeat content you&#39;ve already made available through your briefcase and the various online training you&#39;ve already produced. I focused on getting the most value working specifically on our business Core and around the margins of the products you&#39;ve already made (items I don&#39;t completely understand). Said another way, I put this together hoping for some granularity that I can ONLY get from an in-person meeting with you, Fred, AJ, and others whom you think are appropriate. I&#39;m coming to work. <br><br>Here&#39;s what I came up with. Each represents a discussion point:<br><br>Review Business Foundation<br> - Legal (compliance and framework) *added per Sal - Fred Waid, Esq. assist<br>  * Licensing<br>  * SEC compliance<br>  * Disclaimers (Web, Email, Phone)<br>  * Section 201 (a) Impact<br>  * Document review / customization<br>  * Foreign Filing Requirements<br>  * Operating Agreement / use of membership interests to attract talent<br>  * Unwinding / exit considerations<br><br>- Marketing and Communications<br>  * Auto-responder Sequence (review)<br>  * Phone scripts (review / augment)<br>  * Goals / Targets (help me craft these)<br>     + Deal flow of XX of YY per month (and growth plan)<br>     + X new contacts of Y type<br>     + Others?<br>  * Direct mail sequence<br>  * Deal Toys <br>  * Web site (capital provider, arbitrage, equiteer) * added per Sal<br>  * LinkedIn and other social media (review) * added by virtue of my membership in LinkedIn Leaders<br>  * Virtual Office<br>  * “Big Boy” Conferences<br>     + Where are they?<br>     + What is my value proposition (what do I bring to the table)?<br>     + What am I going in with?<br>     + What should my expectations/take-aways be before, during, and after? <br>  * Rebranding / Use of branded materials<br>  * Other marketing channels<br><br>- Cash Flow<br>  * Setting budgets<br>  * Initial capital contribution<br>  * Controls<br>  * Use of Escrows<br>  * Working capital requirements for each transaction type<br>  * Member compensation<br>  * Tax treatment (general discussion only - I know I need a professional in this discussion) <br><br>- Operations<br>  * Workflows<br>  * First Call to Funding *added per Sal<br>  * Determining Quality / Suitability for a fund<br>  * Papering Transactions<br>  * Outsourcing<br>  * Time Management<br><br> - Products and Services<br>  * Descriptions<br>  * Guides and Templates<br>  * Consulting<br>  * Private banking<br>  * Arbitrage<br>  * Capital Formation<br>  * Hand money brokering<br>  * Phasing of products / services and future growth plan<br>        </p>

          Here&#39;s an addendum: as I move through the material you sent me in the briefcase, my questions are quickly evolving - literally by the hour in some cases. I&#39;ve put things on my agenda that you&#39;ve answered. Your course materials anticipate and, almost like whack-a-mole, knock my questions back into the holes they came from. <br><br>My intent for my DWS is this: like every ship that&#39;s ever launched, a bottle of champaign is broken over the bow before she is slid into the water. I want my day with Sal to be a final check over my systems and materials. At the end of our time together, I want you to help me break that bottle of champaign over the bow as we slide this new vessel into the water. The work I hope we do is a sanity and systems check by more experienced eyes to make sure that I heard, coupled with my previous experience, and have applied the material I am getting from your training. I want to make sure the thing I&#39;ve built is sea worthy. <br><br>An agenda item I&#39;d like to add to my DWS is this: if I knew what you know now, what questions SHOULD I be asking that I am not? <br><br>In addition to the basic discussion outline I posted above (meant to ensure we visit the entire foundation), and plowing through the briefcase at light speed, what &quot;wood&quot; do you recommend that I chop between now and our meeting?         </p>

          Sal - I know we&#39;re getting together next week, and I hope there is still time to share some agenda items. Most of what I posted earlier was about getting my company stuff in one sock. I&#39;ve been making progress on that front. It still needs a sanity check and the proverbial champaign breaking over the bow, but my interests are evolving. I&#39;d like to meet Corey, AJ, and other that I hope to have the privilege of working with. <br><br>I&#39;d like the inside skinny and to get - straight from the source - the information I need to make their jobs easier. It would be great to understand clearly how they define success - so I can make that happen for my part. <br><br>It would also be great to see examples of good deals in action - protecting the source, of course. I think this exposure will give me the insight I need to smooth out wrinkles in my affiliate business and plug it into Dandrew operations effectively.         </p>

          I should have typed &quot;intermediary business&quot; vs &quot;affiliate business.&quot; I come from and prefer high trust environments. New partnerships tend to lurch and bump like a train leaving the station until everyone gets in sync. I hope to minimize bumping with Dandrew. My goal is to clearly understand how you&#39;re defining success and to remove obstacles I may inadvertently bring to the table. <br><br>By way of example, I made it a policy to spend some time with my staffs in their environments. I&#39;d pitch in, listen, observe - as appropriate. I rarely made any substantive changes for the first four months after taking over a new office. This gave me a visceral understanding of what the people I relied on face, what they want, and how to make getting things done easy.         </p>

          I am going to put this out for thought - and maybe to open a dialog about what a fund (or having the skill to craft a fund) could do if We get creative about harvesting value. I acknowledge that this is not even close to being in the current Dandrew wheelhouse, but I wouldn&#39;t be submitting this kind of thing to the deal desk. I only offer it here because Sal has made it clear that he is not trying to be our last stop. He is training us to be more. <br><br>In one hand, I met an investor / operator who is well heeled and interested in old mills in the South. His angle is tax credits, historical restorations, and community development. His last deal involved restoring an old mill and putting up 400 housing units around the mill. Don&#39;t ask me to explain the details of how his angle works because I haven&#39;t had that many dinners with him yet. <br><br>In the other hand, I have family connection to a small rural township in South Carolina that is sporting rich history, three mills, and a pristine lake. I&#39;m playing cupid in my free time - exploring ways to bring money into the town and possibly develop a small tourism attraction around that lake. <br><br>Pro&#39;s: the location is one of four communities in the country designated as a &quot;destination community&quot; in a livability assessment done by a &quot;conservation fund.&quot; State Highways was part of the discussion. I&#39;ve spoken with the current Mayor, the former Mayor, a PM responsible for one of the Mills, and have the wherewithal reach into a relevant Congressman&#39;s office. If someone can get a good enough story/ plan together, we have a better than average chance to juice the deal with some political interest and top cover. Local leadership is on board and already started training local townspeople in hospitality (the first class is next month). They&#39;ve gotten some small grants. They are putting in fiber optics infrastructure and fancy themselves serving business people working out of nearby cities as fully wired getaway. Down the river, a similar project appears to have been successful. They were on their way to executing their strategic plan in 2008, but things all fell apart when the economy tanked.<br><br>Cons: The town is dying. The local townspeople are few and unskilled. Any numbers produced by the town so far indicate that a project here would be a money suck. Without deliberate and intelligent action, this place is going to fall off the map. The town&#39;s strategic plan calls for a 1.5mm infusion in capital to develop a 7.6 acre tiny parcel of land near the lake. It&#39;s projected to return $130k in revenue to the town after year one. I have not been able to find an upside to investors worth talking about yet - but maybe I&#39;m not thinking far enough out of the box. Their strategic plan is on it&#39;s way to my office for review. I think the town is thinking too small. <br><br>It&#39;s an interesting story and one I think this country can benefit from our thinking through. I&#39;ve long said, since I wielded some amount of government authority myself - that our Nation&#39;s problems can&#39;t be solved by government and they won&#39;t be solved by big business. If they are going to be solved, they will be solved by small and mid-sized businesses that find ways to be profitable while creating value in our communities. <br><br>If anyone has any cool ideas or suggestions, I am both ears open. There is more than Dandrew money and wheelhouses following these forums. I know, because you guys are emailing me!        </p>

          A fundamental question for the team: licensing and other legal hurdles: all three financing profit centers seems pretty straight forward on the surface. The training covers the field well and it seems that interests are aligned. Moving forward, I hope to make most efficient use of my legal counsel&#39;s time (and my resources). <br>Are there licensing or other legal hurdles I should look into? <br>Along the same lines, I noticed a recommendation to structure as a Nevada LLC. Why should we be looking in that direction? <br>I assume that I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve got eight days to get this set up, and. I&#39;d rather not run into speed bumps just prior to an event I&#39;ll be attending later this month.          </p>

          Sal - It&#39;s not your event. It&#39;s an event I&#39;d like to use as a marketing opportunity. <br><br>The answer will help with domain and entity name selection, help (but not prevent) me from embarrassing myself on stage, and hopefully prevent a re-do of our credibility kit in February. Beginning on the 22nd, I expect to 1. Have nice lunches and dinners with deal makers, owners, and other lenders 2. Be asked to speak for a few minutes in front of the group about what I am doing. I&#39;d like to include this in my talking points and to deliver those points with enough authority to add a few pounds to my auto-responders.  <br><br>Back room stuff: In order to match a domain name with the name of an entity, we&#39;d like to make sure the entity name is available in the state we set it up. Not having an answer means matching the Nevada database, the Delaware database (where I&#39;ve formed previous entities), and the Maryland database (the state our lawyer defaults to) with the domain registrar. They say we can pay three $75 name reservations (not going to happen) while we decide which state we&#39;re using, or it could mean filing a DBA later. I&#39;m not thrilled about either option. An answer now simplifies things. <br><br>License or other legal hurdles: Someone from the room I am talking to is bound to ask if we need a series seven, a lending license, or something similar in order to structure a fund or lend. I&#39;d prefer to have the answer ahead of time. I&#39;d also like to avoid finding out after they hand us a deal that we need to scramble for a license or punt. Moves like those are reputation killers. <br><br>Once we hit &quot;go&quot; and I get on that plane, I want to know that we&#39;ve done all we need to do - and that there are no legal obstacles we haven&#39;t addressed standing between that prospect and a closed deal. <br><br>My frame of reference: Reg D syndications are full of little rules that need to be followed. Our SEC attorney is forever throwing wet blankets on my talking points, making sure my numbers are right, making sure I&#39;ve established my relationships properly, etc. I have not spoken to him about this yet, but his voice is always in my head. <br><br>I suppose we could pass on using this opportunity to market, but since I&#39;ll be standing on front of a room full of people who will either be funding deals or need money for their deals in less than two weeks, I thought it would be nice to get the ball rolling.        </p>

          Ah. I see. <br><br>tell me how you&#39;re be pitching yourself and what you will be saying. That is what I need to see. Then I can shape a good response for you around that. <br><br>Regarding Reg D, I&#39;m not sure that is something of practical significance. I need to know who you will be talking to, and what your objectives are. <br><br>I&#39;m asking this as I&#39;ve been asked this many times in the past and it sort of nips it in the bud when I just craft a pitch. I see you are a Private Equiteer so if you were just a Banker, I could have answered this already. <br><br>Sal<br><br>        </p>

          I appreciate that you seem to want to help me with my presentation, but that wasn&#39;t the purpose of my question. That said, I&#39;d be a fool to turn down a set of expert eyes on it though, so here&#39;s the skinny:<br><br>&quot;Pitching&quot; is a little strong. I&#39;m attending on a $5k scholarship - something I was awarded due to my status as a military Veteran (http://veterans-scholarship.com/). It&#39;s a several day multi-family commercial real estate course. <br><br>I&#39;m familiar with this course, the instructors, and the makeup of the audience. I started with this group back in 2005 or so - went through their gold coaching program, etc. I&#39;ve also purchased property with some of these people, put some of my own money into their deals as an LP, and placed some of their funds into multi-family investments I trusted. I am known in these circles. I expect that there is a higher than average chance that I&#39;ll be targeted to say a few words. I want to be ready. <br><br>This audience is made up of students with various levels of experience, hard money lenders, and sponsors looking to hone their skills. I&#39;ve even run into local bankers from time to time. This course is a little advanced for beginners. <br><br>My objective for next week is to stuff my auto-responder with as many contacts as I can carry. Since I do most everything electronically, I can carry a lot. <br><br>My &quot;pitch,&quot; (open to criticism) is very simple: I am an investor like many in the room. I&#39;m also an Investment Officer for MLC Capital Partners. We&#39;re a buyer of some things and a financier of many. If you know someone who is in need of bridge loan products between $2M and $30M or would just like to know more about the types of financing we offer, text your name and email address to... I will respond within 24 hours.&quot; <br><br>My auto-responder is nearly configured for this event. My Web site is up (http://MLCCapitalPartners.com). My credibility kit is being crafted &amp; should be done in time. I have a nice catchers mitt set up to catch and follow up with whatever shakes out. I just wish I had the time to grab that LinkedIn guide you publish so I could set that up correctly before i go. I heard in one of your continuing ed&#39;s how to get that, so hopefully Monday...<br><br>I couldn&#39;t wait on the LLC. I set it up in Delaware. It&#39;s easy. I&#39;m familiar with Delaware. They&#39;re fast, business friendly, and they don&#39;t hit me with the filing fees that Nevada now does. Besides, the girl I asked to do this for me lives and works in Delaware. No brainer. <br><br>I also started someone on the licensing and other legal hurdles search. If you can shortcut that for me, it&#39;ll help. I want to know if I&#39;ll need something like a series seven, or if I have to do something like establish and document pre-existing relationships (as I do with Reg D syndications of mom and pop money). Also... are there any circumstance where I may have to foreign file in some other state (either investor state or property state) as I continue with DandrewPartners?         </p>

          I get it. now. However, I don&#39;t know if this is the appropriate setting to finding meaningful sponsors. These are mostly seminar grads who want to learn the business but not necessarily *actually do the business*. You&#39;re going to attract good attention. But perhaps not the quality attention that AJ gets when we send him out to these conferences. <br><br>(We&#39;ll be releasing some footage of me pitching at a Grownup conference to all Private Equiteers later this week so keep you eyes on your email.)<br><br>Most Intermediaries go to the what we call the &quot;Grownup Conferences&quot; that the playmakers go to. <br><br>So as far as licensing, I will tell you that I&#39;m not an attorney nor am I qualified to render legal advice. So what that said, we have paid intermediaries who have closed deals as 1099 consultants. <br><br>As far as Delaware, I think there are tax consequences there too and not as strong anonymity as Nevada LLCs. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I agree with your assessment of quality of attention. It may not be hitting the &quot;sweet spot.&quot; The immediate value that this brings me (and by extension, to you) is that it forces me to get my proverbial act together. I&#39;m using it as a dry run, so to speak, but treating it as if...<br><br>Results so far: My Web site is running. Email is established. LLC is set up. Discussions with lawyers are under way. My credibility kit is being designed. A logo is being designed separately. I&#39;m setting up my auto-responder today. I&#39;ve distilled my elevator speech. My suits are pressed. My shoes are shined. My 800 number is set up... etc. <br><br>An analogy: Sign up to run a 10K and see what it does for your body. As one who swam 8 miles, biked 500, (etc) - (not at the same time); I can say that a 10K run isn&#39;t all that impressive by itself. I do 10k&#39;s as daily workouts. But if you need to get going, knowing that an event like this is in front of you and on the calendar is excellent. <br><br>This content in this program is very close to what you teach. It covers market selection, asset valuation (using the NOI method), take down, managing property management, positioning for sale, and more. It goes into considerably more depth on the multi-family asset class - as this course was designed for operators, sponsors, syndicators, etc. There is a lot on numbers and market analysis. <br><br>It&#39;s a course I don&#39;t mind repeating 8 years later. After having evolved my business model to include Dandrew financial products, I am going back with something of value to offer. <br><br>What you say about Delaware vs Nevada anonymity is exactly what I thought. I believe that was the way entity formation used to be. I was told this week, however, that things have changed in Nevada - both in terms of filing fees and in anonymity. Delaware does not require me to list my company officers in the operating agreement, for example. Nevada does. I&#39;m not a lawyer either. I&#39;ve just been listening to them for the last few days - for what that&#39;s worth. <br><br>Licensing is more on my radar as it pertains to the PLN (part of our credibility kit that I assume was written or reviewed by you) and as it pertains to the Capital Formation Series. Collection of individual investors and/or securitizing into funds seems to me would have SEC interest. This issue won&#39;t have much impact on my trip this week, but I will likely be circling back around with you once I get back. <br><br>I look forward to seeing the footage you mention above. Thank you for your reply.         </p>

          As it relates to the Banker and Arbitrage work you&#39;ll be doing at this event, licensing isn&#39;t an issue, generally speaking. You will probably not get even one deal from that room as they aren&#39;t qualified. This may not be what you want to hear, but I&#39;d just rather tell you to manage your expectations. Lindhal is a great guy and great instructor, but not the place I would go hunting for deals. <br><br>The PLN and when you start *actively* soliciting money that is when the conversation will change. <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal - money finds me. A few months ago, I raised and placed about half a mil and I sincerely didn&#39;t try. I was just helping a friend. We accomplished our goal with an attorneys help via a PPM, subscription, and operating agreements. We&#39;ll see value created for everyone involved. Success breeds more success. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t have to be right away, but I would like to know how to start that conversation with you in the not too distant future. People with mom and pop money call me. I find deals.  <br><br>I&#39;d like to know what my options are - if any.         </p>

          I put it into syndication that was used to acquire - and is still being used to reposition - a 140 unit garden style multi-family apartment in a TIF zone in Fort Worth. The pool was fixed, the fences mended, new signage, etc... the usual. The bigger challenge has been fixing the tenant base. Stricter leasing parameters, partnerships w local resources, raising rents to market levels, and non-negotiable rent collection procedures have been making the difference in this regard. <br><br>It&#39;s not performing yet, but the NOI is trending in the right direction. We had to do an internal raise for cash flow purposes to satisfy a Fannie Mae 4505 requirement placed by Arbor, but that&#39;s behind us now and things are looking up. <br><br>I&#39;ve purchased as an LP in this general area before, have established some good local relationships, and understand (from experience) the value of good sponsor / operator selection. <br><br>This operator has many strengths, but should have been vetted a little deeper.  They would have benefitted from some shoring up on the syndication and investor management side. This is one aspect of your program I find appealing. I&#39;ve had to be more involved as an LP than I would have liked, but I have a responsibility to take care of the folks who trust me. My reputation is a resource I don&#39;t want to have to fix. <br><br>I&#39;d rather not disclose the operator (s) in this venue.         </p>

          David<br><br>Nice! You’re the kind of people I like working with and keep me doing what I do for Dandrew Media. Great story! <br><br>But being cynical at best and paranoid at worst, my questions are getting the better of me. <br><br>How long has this been going on for? The Bad Operator story is common. “I don’t know how this guy Bad Operator keeps getting rehired”, is the punchline in the industry lately… Don’t be afraid to put the proverbial gun to his head to make him go away via exercising the bad boy clauses. (You do have these clauses, right?!)<br> <br>*Sal’s Rule: Good operators make bad deals great, bad operators make good deals bad.*<br><br>Stick with us as the Private Equiteer and you’ll have enough knowledge to not have to worry about losing your reputational capital. Stay cynical. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Are you using a lock box to collect rents? You should be… If you’re on an AskDandrew call, remind me to tell you about the “lie detector” line that I used to scare a PM away. <br><br>PPS You should be going to Grownup Conferences with this experience. Why you’re going to a seminar with newbies I don’t know but you must see value there. <br>        </p>

          Day 1 results: 15 contacts made - two strong operator teams, and a couple handfuls of tire kickers and wanna bees. <br><br>First operator team: husband and wife company w 1,000+ units actively buying now and going over term sheets w other hard money lenders as I type this. Their issue is growth and bandwidth. They need a cash infusion to keep their acquisition pace. I did not dig too deeply into their qualifications, but they had duties segmented out well, have partners with SME on their team, and present as pretty well organized. The conversation is started w them, but it will take a little while to cultivate the relationship. They are already working closely with another hard money lender to get deals done. The specific deal we discussed briefly today has two term sheets from hard money lenders already on it. <br><br>Second operator team: Handed me an deal in writing that they are looking for equity to support. 224 unit in N Houston. Recently rehabbed. $7.6M purchase price. 1st position loan is occupied. They are looking for private equity or hard money to get the deal closed. Business partner is sending me 5 data points. The deal is yellow until then. I expect it to fall out, but it gives us a chance to talk and me a chance to meet the partners. <br><br>The second operator also opened a discussion about a hotel being flagged now ($80M purchase) - reportedly in progress now and looking for a large lender to take out several smaller lenders. The guy asking me to consider this is a commercial broker, but he is principal in this transaction. His personal portfolio is reportedly at around $100M and I presume he will be willing to cross collateralize. <br><br>I have nothing concrete and nothing to submit to the deal desk that I would risk my reputation capital on, but since you asked me about value, these are what I consider seeds. Deal makers like these aren&#39;t growing moss on their back sides. They are turning deals several times per year, know other legitimate deal makers who are shaking trees, and my thesis is they are bound to run into situations where our products can help. Please correct me if I&#39;m off target. <br><br>These guys are all on my drip campaign and will be segmented as I get the sequence set up. Doing this all on the fly from my iPhone at the conference and my laptop in a hotel room - and my credibility kit is still being printed at FEDEX Kinkos at the moment, but I believe it&#39;s a start.        </p>

          &gt; I posted my reply in another thread by accident from my iPhone. Here it is again in context. &lt;<br><br>Sal – thanks for your reply. I feel pretty confident about the material Dandrew created. Strong value add. <br>It’s been going on since July. I think 12-18 months is a fair timeframe to give an operator to turn around a repositioning. We’re about 2k per door into our CAPEX plan. I expect this one will take us to $5k per door by the time it’s done. Big changes. Positive perception improvements so far. NOI is steadily increasing. Despite some of my colleagues unrest, I’m not uncomfortable yet. <br>As a condition of our investment, we get direct ‘live’ access into Buildium – the software used by our property management team. I can see everything to the work order level. The math works out. <br><br>This is a high trust environment. The operator is strong – but is dealing with unexpected medical challenges. <br><br>I have not considered a lock box, but I would have nothing bad to say about that idea. I’m betting that it’s effective. I don’t presume to know the property management side better than our property manager in place – but I’ve seen some hokus pocus and are watching closely for anomalies. We’re asking questions when appropriate. They’ve been transparent. <br><br>I look forward to the “lie detector” story. <br><br>Value so far: connected with a set of operators who are currently looking for hard money. They have about 1000 units behind them and are collecting term sheets. I have a hard money guy they are working closely with now, but I expect after this relationship matures a little, they’ll be giving me a call. I am farming while getting up to speed with Dandrew.        </p>

          To my disappointment, after asking for five data points - or in the case of capital formation cases, their deal book and bios - information that trickled in was incomplete ad/or weak. Many of these leads went dark. Poof! Smoked. No more responses. <br><br>Another fund guy I met cautioned me about them immediately following the trip. He suggested that anyone who hands me a deal in an open forum looking for equity - or tries to get me to fill out an accredited investor form on the first meeting - probably isn&#39;t someone I want to be too close to. <br><br>In retrospect, this vanishing act is simply proof that we&#39;re on the right track. It&#39;s much better to vanquish the phantoms than waste time chasing them. <br><br>Next.        </p>

          I should summarize: This event yielded 41 contacts added to our auto responder. In addition to the potential deals I listed above (which have been trimmed down to zippy through continued dialog), I was given three referrals (not related to the event), and will continue to cultivate relationships with three seemingly strong operators (point of fact: two operators, and one fund manager who claims to be vetting me to help him deploy capital for his fund). <br><br>I believe that most of the 41 contacts in our auto responder sequence will not be productive business catalysts themselves. I do think they add value from the perspective that:<br><br>1. We can use them to hone our messaging and surveys<br>2. We can get our follow up systems into shape without risking making all of our inevitable mistakes in front of high value clients <br>3. We&#39;ve increased our potential for referrals<br>4. These people may become value added clients as our portfolio of services expands. For example, We may be able to help them down the road through hard money brokering once those relationships are forged. <br><br>And that is how we make lemonade.         </p>

          I would agree. I think it was the nature of the event... It was a guru meeting, albeit it probably had some folk there who were qualified, but I&#39;m wondering any FMs would go to this event in the first place. <br><br>Talk is cheap.<br><br>Cynical at best, paranoid at worst.         </p>

          Sal - thanks for your reply. I feel pretty confident about the material Dandrew created. Strong value add. <br>It&#39;s been going on since July. I think 12-18 months is a fair timeframe to give an operator to turn around a repositioning. We&#39;re about 2k per door into our CAPEX plan. I expect this one will take us to $5k per door by the time it&#39;s done. Big changes. Positive perception improvements so far. NOI is steadily increasing. Despite some of my colleagues unrest, I&#39;m not uncomfortable yet. <br>As a condition of our investment, we get direct &#39;live&#39; access into Buildium - the software used by our property management team. I can see everything to the work order level. The math works out. <br><br>This is a high trust environment. The operator is strong - but is dealing with unexpected medical challenges. <br><br>I have not considered a lock box, but I would have nothing bad to say about that idea. I&#39;m betting that it&#39;s effective. I don&#39;t presume to know the property management side better than our property manager in place - but I&#39;ve seen some hokus pocus and are watching closely for anomalies. We&#39;re asking questions when appropriate. They&#39;ve been transparent. <br><br>I look forward to the &quot;lie detector&quot; story. <br><br>Value so far: connected with a set of operators who are currently looking for hard money. They have about 1000 units behind them and are collecting term sheets. I have a hard money guy they are working closely with now, but I expect after this relationship matures a little, they&#39;ll be giving me a call. I am farming while getting up to speed with Dandrew.         </p>

          Do you think Sam Zell&#39;s move is a bellwether - inviting us to consider an imminent interest rate hike and withdraw from the secondary and tertiary markets, or is this a reporter interpreting crop circles?: <br>http://therealdeal.com/blog/2015/10/26/is-5-3b-sale-sam-zells-way-of-saying-the-partys-over/<br>        </p>

          It isn&#39;t my conclusion. The author asks the questions, implies a connection, then leaves the conclusion to the reader:<br><br>&quot;During the real estate investment trust’s earnings call Monday, UBS analyst asked: “Should people be reading in this that Sam is calling the top of the market twice in a row?” <br><br>&quot;“Our belief is that long-term risk-adjusted returns in the urban core will exceed those in other markets,” Neithercut said on the call. He argued that prices in secondary cities might be more vulnerable, in the short term, to the effects of an interest-rate hike by the Federal Reserve and policy shifts by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and, in the long term, to an increase in housing supply.&quot;<br><br>He is implying that Sam MAY be contracting his portfolio to urban centers to avoid exposure in secondary markets &quot;to the effects of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve and policy shifts...&quot;<br><br>Thus the question: do you think Sam&#39;s move is a bellwether or do you think the author is encouraging readers to draw conclusions that are not there?        </p>

          I think Sam is timing it perfectly based off of cap rate compression to the point where he’s getting top of the market rents and is taking his chips off the table.<br><br>I don’t have many heroes, but “the Gravedancer” is one of them. And will be the name of my next boat, frankly. I don’t think rates have anything really to do with it as much as the media loves to fucking talk about it endlessly. <br><br>Let me further go down this rabbit hole with you based off my convo last night with a guy I know who runs a $400mm macro-driven fund: Inflation expectations are THE most important data point in the Fed and ECB models that drive monetary policy decision making. And those models, say that you’re a fool if you raise rates now. <br><br>What Draghi and Yellen are doing is exactly what happens when you abdicate social policy to models, when you pretend that you’re just a technocratic financial regulator, and I suppose that’s what makes me angriest of all. I can see where this is going politically. <br><br>This is the reason why I’m starting a podcast. Because freelance writers who make $45,000 a year writing articles don&#39;t really understand how any of this works.        </p>

          Be sure to send the link. I&#39;ll be one of your first subscribers. <br><br>We&#39;ve talked about your connection with Sam before. I thought you might have some intelligent commentary to share. It&#39;s rare to find people who think a little more critically about the material we find in the regular press. If we didn&#39;t know better, we might take articles like this for face value. Fortunately, we do know better and as a bonus, get paid because of it.         </p>

          I&#39;m anticipating, Sal. The question came to me over the phone (then later over breakfast) with an investor I&#39;ve built a long standing relationship with. <br><br>The point was slipped in the context of what else (business) we might do together. <br><br>No reality show filming with these guys - though they might be amused by the suggestion. He and his partners have bought and repositioned many mobile home parks over the years. They control several as I type this and I know this group is legit. Everyone in our circle understands that financing is challenging in this (mobile home park) space and there is a heavy reliance on creative structuring. <br><br>It dawned on me when he dropped that &quot;$11mm deal they are working on&quot; that &quot;will need financing - &quot; that I know very little about financing mobile home parks. I know Dandrew finances mobile home parks from time to time, and thought I would ask for some insight. <br><br>In my mind, it would be good to have a few qualifying questions lined up before my colleague and I have this chat again. <br><br>Mike - thanks for the offer. Look for my call in the coming weeks. This is mid-range horizon right now, but they are entirely focused on this model. It&#39;s a matter of time before more come up. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll be invited back to the table when it does.         </p>

          If they have a strong track record for this, you should structure this as a deck for them to use on an evergreen basis. <br><br>Put some case studies of their deals in there and then take it to Preqin. <br><br>That’s what I would do. Of course you won’t do this for free, but if they are bankable, you can charge the consulting fee as an advance against equity or cash flow kickers. <br><br>And send this deal in to deals@ for me to review.         </p>

          For the good of the order (and by direction from Sal), I offer these video/audio programs as a gift to the Dandrew community. I&#39;m often asked by loan seekers to fund above the 75% LTV line. These same loan seekers question why we need to understand current debt structure. Rarely do these loan seekers understand the capital stack. I created these as aids - and as a way to save some of my valuable time. They are titled Knowing Your Capital Stack: <br><br>Podcast Version (Audio Only): http://mlccapitalpartners.com/capitalstack.html<br><br>Video Version (with graphics): http://mlccapitalpartners.com/capitalstackvideo.html        </p>

          Thanks for the feedback. If it helps, then it was worth the effort. Maybe I&#39;ll share one or two more if Sal approves. <br>Speaking of sharing worthy efforts, kudos to you, Naedo. I heard you share your recent successes on Dandrew Silver earlier this week. Iimpressive tenacity and resourcefulness. <br>It was good meeting you too, Michael.  Next time, let&#39;s grab a coffee or something.         </p>

          I get very wary of a headline that reads &quot;The New Normal&quot;. That just throws everything out of the window as it relates to the law that market cycles don&#39;t exist anymore. <br><br>For example, oil was going to go the sky, right? Now look what&#39;s happening...<br><br>Tell me what this catalyst is for rates to increase before I bite.

          True. Not a very useful title. What are you seeing from &quot;smart&quot; investors re: factoring possible interest rate increases / cost of capital scenarios into the probability of beating hurdle rates? Is it even being considered as a risk on the horizon? Or is that extra 18 trillion in debt treated as a non-factor?<br><br>I personally believe we&#39;re seeing unprecedented manipulation of the markets. It can&#39;t last forever. Historically, big moves have happened about 6-9 months after a new Fed chair takes over. There isn&#39;t an actuary in the CBO who doesn&#39;t believe we&#39;re watching the tide roll out in advance of a tsunami.         </p>

          Person contacted me this evening about financing in the upstate New York area. Before I tell him we don&#39;t lend in New York, has there been any change to this policy? <br>If not, what is the reason - if you don&#39;t mind me asking - for not lending in New York or New Jersey? I don&#39;t mind that we don&#39;t, I just like to understand: Is this just Dandrew Specific and we should try to find other lenders to cover these areas, or is there a reason we should ALL steer clear of these areas?         </p>

          We lend in NJ? Who said no? <br><br>Also, Upstate NY is more of a service-based economy. its rural and kind of depressed and desolate. So that&#39;s going to be a tougher sell.        </p>

          Dearest David: <br><br>*1. What site are you now using to update your mezz coupon rates? The site you were using (http://www.mezzcapfinance.com/html/core_prodsum.html) doesn’t appear to be working for me.*<br><br>We never used a “website” for our mezz coupon rates. (Google &quot;Libor Scandal&quot; if you want some good bedtime/toilet reading.) We go off of the cost of our capital and risk and plug it into our proprietary models to come up with that rate. Then we sprinkle a little market color from my friends (like Gordon, but not Gordon) to see where the market is at. <br><br>For example: If I want 12, and the market is at 5, I’m not competitive, right?<br><br> *2. Can you briefly explain what you mean by the term “Exit Sizing?”*<br>Yes, *Exit Sizing Financing* means that the we “stress” the asset at different LTVs and interest rates to see what type of exit loan (remember, we need to get taken out after any value added work is done and either the buyer or the borrower will need to get a perm loan to take us out. <br><br>So rather than leave fate to the wind, a good risk management technique would be to know when making the loan if the property would be suitable for a perm loan? Right? <br><br>(PS Guess how I made a fortune buying bankrupted hard money funds? Those idiots never thought about the exit strategy, can you believe that?!)<br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          My mother used to call me &quot;Damit David.&quot; To see that I&#39;ve become &quot;Dearest David&quot; to you feels like a promotion and weirds me out a little at the same time. <br><br>This approach you describe re: #1 makes sense. I was just tring to make sense of the Dandrew underwriting template you sent me. It says to go to that Web site to update Mezz coupon rate, but it wouldn&#39;t open for me. I had never heard of that site, didn&#39;t understand that data point, and am still not clear why it&#39;s on your template. I thought I was perhaps a way to get the baseline market rate. <br><br>#2 is solid. It makes good sense. Is this the primary reason you look for proforma NOI? To see what stabilized cash flows might look like to the next banker down the line?         </p>

          Sal - can you give a simple example of the commission we are agreeing to with our client with respect to commission on debt? I&#39;m referring to the following para in the agreement: &quot;0-$100 million 1.0% of debt capital committed whether funded initially or not, as well as 3% of the promote or share of distributions in the Special Purpose Entity (SPE) formed between Investor and CLIENT.&quot; <br><br>Assume a loan size of $2.4mm. When, how, and how much are intermediaries getting paid for this size deal?         </p>

          Yeap. Understand that. I&#39;m thinking more for education of my client here. Here&#39;s what I wrote this AM to a potential debt client: &quot;Our fee is 1% of debt committed + 3% of the deal (cash flows + equity). Said another way, this agreement incentivizes us to bring you as much capital as we can round up, and contribute whatever we can to help your project be profitable. We win when you win. If this thing poops out, we go home empty handed.&quot;        </p>

          If they get funded, meaning SPE is set up and Operating Agreement is executed, you get paid. Period. Whether they use those funds tomorrow or 1 year from now makes no difference. And yes, they may need to come out of pocket to pay you. Happens all the time.        </p>

          I don&#39;t question that we get paid. I&#39;m trying to decipher the agreement relative to the timing (up front at the close, hope certificates that float, cash flow along the way, etc) and define the specific pile of beans we&#39;re taking our percentage from - specifically, the 3%. <br><br>It&#39;s pretty clear in my mind that 1% of the amount raised comes to us regardless of when it&#39;s used. So, that translates to $10,000 for every $1mm committed by Dandrew or whomever we secure as a debt funding source. After that, we&#39;re asking for &quot;3% of the promote or share of distributions in the SPE formed between client and investor.&quot; This is where I need clarity. <br><br>What is that 3%? Is that 3% of the portion of cash flows and equity of the entire deal (to include sponsor contribution)? Is it 3% of the fraction of the deal that is funded by the institutional investor (Dandrew) - which possibly includes 1st trust deed and cap-ex? Is it 3% of the profits from the debt portion contributed by the institutional investor only (calculating cap-ex as equity contribution and using the equity sliding scale in the agreement to calculate that portion)? <br><br>See where my question lies? I know everything can be negotiated, but I need to explain this agreement, as written, to my client clearly. As of last night, they are claiming our fees are too expensive. I suspect they are not calculating them the way you intended in the intermediary agreement.         </p>

          Dave: <br><br>The 3% is not of cash flow. No one is going to pay that. They’re not going to make their juice payments. Its off of the equity at the time of sale or refinance. <br><br>It’s that simple. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          This post is for general good of the order. I created this podcast that talks about Sponsorship Substitution. Sal asked me to post it here. For those who are interested, it explains what Sponsorship Substitution is and how it can help both new and experienced investors to get more deals funded. It also hints at the importance of building a rolodex of qualified sponsors. Please use it in good health: https://rch.audello.com/sponsorship-substitution/         </p>

          I&#39;m not sure if you were getting market intel or if you wanted me to tell this borrower that I was doing it. I went ahead and did it myself:<br><br>This property has been neglected. Cap-ex came in a little higher than what was expected, but the borrower still has confidence that it&#39;s doable. Deferred maintenance isn&#39;t as significant a problem as the quality of the tenant profile and the property&#39;s reputation in the community. A hands-off, out of state owner allowed tenant profile to decline. Crime went up. Brokers were having a hard time selling this property - though they report many offers coming in between 4 and 4.5 mm. The current owner (92 years old) purchased for $3mm cash, and never had debt on it. <br><br>According to the borrower, Marcus and Millichap have misrepresented the repairs needed and the overall value of the property (they valued it at over $5mm as-is). I wasn&#39;t surprised by this, but I was impressed that the borrower came forward with that disclosure. <br><br>The current owner (the seller) hired a new property management firm one year ago who started to evict bad tenants and turn this around. Despite gains in economic occupancy, and decreases in tenant complaints, the reputation in town is still in need of improvement. From one broker, I heard it is &quot;the second worst property in the market.&quot; I believe he has bias (see below).<br><br>The market itself isn&#39;t moving a lot of inventory. There has been no new product development and there is nothing planned. Two of the most relevant comps had their markets created at the auction block. <br><br>The city is interested in seeing this property improve and appear cooperative. The borrower has a good relationship with the code inspector, there are tax incentives to bring in new business, and the city has told our borrower that they would love to see the burned buildings in the back of this property demolished. Reportedly, they are housing criminal element. <br><br>The big crime area for Fort Wayne is about five miles North of this property, and despite it&#39;s reputation, feet in the ground in Fort Wayne tell me that the property is not as bad (any more) as it&#39;s reputation would suggest. The area surrounding the property is reportedly quite nice (more like a B). The Chicago property management firm is reportedly making a difference. <br><br>Properties in the area (the ones that are moving) are moving at between $11k  and $13k per door on the low end. This property will be purchased for around $8k per door. <br><br>There is a significant Burmese population in this sub-market. This is relevant only because one broker described the neighboring property as 95% occupied because it&#39;s 100% Burmese. He told me that these people &quot;flocked together,&quot; so it can&#39;t be used as proxy for what our borrower&#39;s property might be able to do. He, as a broker who used to list this property, but had no success, was pretty negative, but I suspect there is bitterness there. A second broker wasn&#39;t so negative, but he wants his company to manage it and wants the listing after reposition.<br><br>Local management companies, I am told, are not well qualified to reposition this asset. The current owner brought in a company based out of Chicago to reposition it for sale one year ago. Our borrower feels this Chicago company is making progress and wants to keep them in place. <br><br>There are 60,362 people within 3 miles of this property. 47% male, 53% female. It&#39;s a young population with 19% under the age of 13. 14.6k families with 53% living as husband/wife. 83% occupied total housing units (including SFR) with 7% vacancy in rentals. Most renters are between 29 and 48 years old. 54% are African American. 31% are white. <br><br>I have a call in to the local PD to check on crime stats for the sub-market and to get the temperature on crime at this property. No response yet. <br><br>I am told that refinance would be an easy exit once the key event (tenant and reputation repositioning) occurs. I&#39;m looking into the sponsor&#39;s experience with tenant and reputation repositions of C assets in a B neighborhood. I&#39;d also like to get an estimate of time from them for the reposition. The borrower and the property manager are putting together their plans and budgets now.        </p>

          Can you succinctly define a &quot;qualified sponsor?&quot; I was just sent a bio that clearly looks like a broker to me. I&#39;d like to give some specific parameters. Net worth requirements, deal volume, recency of experience, relevancy of experience, etc.         </p>

          Dave, <br><br>You&#39;ll know it when you see it. There are no &quot;boxes&quot; to place these people into. No boxes to tick-off like the gov&#39;t makes you for &quot;accredited investors&quot;, etc. <br><br>Many of our sponsors (sometimes) don&#39;t have any net worth requirements. Just tell them to send you over their deal sheet of deals that they&#39;ve closed that they were an owner on. <br><br>Like in the Sales Desk Espionage system. This guy had a portfolio of stuff he&#39;s done and not done. <br><br>Its all about the underwriting standards of the lender / capital provider. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Dave<br><br>Great question. This does happen, but not in the same way that resi sees. <br><br>In commercial, the can be some title issues due to Tenants-in-Common being fragmented. In order for something to clear a trade (title-wise) all TICs must sign off. <br><br>Residential is more linked to the ability to prove clear title from the robo-signing fraud, where foreclosures were not effected properly. <br><br>May I ask why you’re asking this? Is it deal related? <br><br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          It is. I&#39;m working to help clarify a client&#39;s business case (see key event discussion below). His vocabulary and some references he&#39;s made makes me think he&#39;s done a lot of this with resi - not so much with commercial. I&#39;m teasing details out for him as we create his pitch book. <br><br>Seemed to me like he mixed some fruit in his basket. Keeping his pitch focused. Institutional investors would smell the inconsistencies, take it as a sign of his inexperience, and I am concerned it would hurt his chances to secure funding. <br><br>Thank you for the sanity check!        </p>

          No doubt, agreed. <br>The team has a better depth of experience. He hatched the idea by bringing together several disciplines from his own experience. He then went out and gathered up a team that has the specific skills the project needs. This is a team of 9 people so far. KPMG insisted on background checks for all members and a vetted CEO that had experience taking companies public. He is following. He stepped back and took a &quot;chairman of the board&quot; position. He just needs help with his vocabulary, teasing out his numbers and business case to make sure they make sense, and his presentation. I&#39;m dressing him up for church &amp; earning every penny of my retainer and fees.         </p>

          Valuing / Screening of Key Event:<br><br>When the value of a property is depended on a key event in order to make sense, please help me understand how Dandrew scores / evaluates these deals as candidates for financing. I provide numbers below because it&#39;s a real deal and I want to use it as a proxy to discuss Key Event. I know the loan value below is low for Dandrew, but if we multiply the numbers by 2 or 3...(I have another one similar to this from the same sponsor (and set up the same way that needs $2.38mm):<br><br>- A pair of NNN commercial properties in Tempe, AZ. They come as a package.<br>- Asking price: $2,315,000. <br>- Current NOI both both: $175,189<br>- Offer price: $2,100,000<br>- Sources and uses: $1.47mm (70%) from Dandrew, $630k from the sponsor (syndicated) for acquisition. <br>- Exit for us is refinance in 6 Months. <br>- Proforma NOI: $535,189<br>- Property value in less than 120 days: $6,417,134. <br><br>Note the jump in NOI. The key event described in the business plan makes this deal a lot more attractive. It is also dependent on experience that is brought to the deal by a service provider - not by the sponsor directly. This sponsor is placing solar panels on the roof, reducing the electricity bill for the tenant by 30%, and transferring the remaining 70% to the income column on the financial statement. By providing 100% of the power, we are creating an income stream that didn&#39;t exist at acquisition.         </p>

          Dave, <br><br>Let me clarify a few things here: <br><br>1.  Are you saying the huge jump in the NOI is attributed to the expense savings caused by the electricity conservation efforts? <br><br>2.  Creating 100% of the power consumption for the building doesn’t create any revenue. Creating *100.1% or more* will provide a revenue stream... <br><br>3.  Expense reduction is widely not seen as a credible value added play. Can you break out the Proforma this way: <br><br>a.  Just increase in rental revenues and occupancy *alone*.<br>b.  Both a) above and the power reduction. <br><br>I want to see how this looks. Please place it here. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          This is more than expense reduction, Sal. This is conversion of expense to income. <br><br>At a 10 cap, every dollar that comes off the expense side = $10 increase in NOI. Every dollar that gets added to the income side creates $10 increase in NOI. Simple math. <br><br>If we don&#39;t own the building, we&#39;re simply reducing electricity expense by a fat percentage - saving the tenant a huge chunk of money. If we do own the building, we are restructuring the lease and charging the tenant for electricity. Imagine being the power company AND the property owner. <br><br>This model will blow your mind. By the way, I have an engagement letter to raise $250mm...        </p>

          I mistyped and can&#39;t retrieve my error to correct it. <br>I meant to say that in a 10 cap environment, every dollar that comes off the expense side and every dollar that gets added to the income side = $10 increase in value (not NOI). This is simple math when value = NOI/cap rate.         </p>

          294 unit property under contract in a market population 294,349 - for $9.4 mm. Primary funding source failed to perform. Contract expires at the end of the month. <br><br> &gt; Proforma NOI: $1,201,218<br> &gt; Current NOI: $833,823<br> &gt; Existing assumable 1st TD loan from Arbor at $7,350,000<br> &gt; C+ asset in a B+ area. Seller bought it under distress in 2012 and put $1.8mm Cap-ex in exterior renovations. <br> &gt; 93% occupied in a market that shows 93% occupied comps (stable)<br><br>Total Capital Needs at Closing $3,400,000 <br>    -Down Payment $2,050,000<br>    -Closing Costs $282,000<br>    -Acquisition Fee $470,000 <br>    -Loan Points $73,500<br>    -Misc/Upgrade Reserve $524,500<br><br>Upgrades average $3,333 per door for 150 doors. Details available.  The rest of the upgrades will either be financed by operations or, for an additional $500K ($3.9mm total), they would call it a reposition and upgrade the entire property. Loss to lease is expected to be around $75 / unit, but I have not confirmed this number yet. Waiting on broker&#39;s return calls. <br><br>Value based on a 7.8 cap rate (what the borrower reports) is $10.69mm. I&#39;m collecting broker informal opinions on cap rates and per unit costs for this property as a backup. <br><br>Sponsor has experience and a track record that shows $80.5mm in assets under management in his career. We don&#39;t know yet, how many assets are under management right now or if there are cross-collateral options. As far as I can tell, this sponsor is putting no skin in the game. <br><br>Is this something I should continue to pursue, or are we too high in the debt stack to consider this? <br>        </p>

          I agree. As is, I don&#39;t like the risk. I&#39;m exploring the cross-collateralization angle. Sponsor has had $80.5mm under management. I&#39;m thinking with some extra collateral pledged, this might be more attractive. If it goes sideways, there could be options. <br>What are your thoughts as to caps on leverage when deploying pref equity? Are you still wanting to stay under 75% total, or might cross collateral make you feel better levering it up?         </p>

          Crossing collateral would definitely make this more attractive. But again, if he is fully levered on the others, it doesn&#39;t make sense. <br><br>SAl        </p>

          If I can get them to come back with some room, I&#39;ll set it up for you. They seemed pretty motivated last week. <br>They&#39;ve been quiet since I mentioned cross collateral. Depends on how much they want this deal, I suppose. <br>Moving on.         </p>

          Borrower got spooked by the cross-collateral option. I figure if they aren&#39;t confident enough to put their own collateral behind the funds, then we probably shouldn&#39;t be confident either.         </p>

          So they want us to take all the risk. 99% financing and they don&#39;t want to cross? How much equity can they come to the table with? <br><br>Ask them *how do I show to capital providers your conviction in this deal in a market that is seemingly getting toppy?*<br><br>Sal         </p>

          I cut them loose. They had no conviction and wanted us to take all of the risk. We see a lot of them like that. Many others looking for equity below our $1mm threshold. <br>I thought a cross might make this one interesting, but they chose to pass rather than put their own equity at risk. Telling statement all by itself.         </p>

          How do you think you would look in front of a debt or equity provider (other than I) if you were to present this asymmetric risk? <br><br>They all have Investment Committees. Remember to preserve your intellectual capital. Sponsors come and go. The capital providers will feed you for life.         </p>

          This deal developed that way. No doubt, Sal. <br>Hopefully, my debt or equity provider would be grateful that we had sorted through a ton of other less attractive deals to unearth this one, that we recognized that the contract was expiring at the end of the month, the sponsor was motivated, and time was of the essence. And that we were kind enough to shoot up a flare in case this deal developed as it was originally advertised. <br>If the sponsor remained as motivated at the end as they were when we started talking, this could have turned into something worth investing in. We&#39;ve been sparing you from the turds. We&#39;re up to our waists in those.         </p>

          Sal - I&#39;ve just added a couple of qualified sponsors to a database we&#39;ll use for sponsorship substitutions. When it comes time to actively substitute, are we running a Fannie Mae 1003 on them? At what point is it appropriate to pull two years of financials and credit?         </p>

          An operator asked me &quot;How can I prevent the bait and switch?&quot; He was referring to the phenomenon where other banks offer him terms, then change those terms at the last minute. Apparently, he&#39;s had experience. How does he protect himself from last minute shift in terms - not that we would do that, but I think our thought leadership adds credibility to the discussion.         </p>

          David<br><br>All banks do that. <br><br>But we&#39;re not a bank.

          Guy trying to get &quot;back into&quot; real estate. He&#39;s conversant and critical. Likely a good bird dog, but lacks the necessary net worth or experience to be the sponsor himself. What&#39;s your recommended process for sponsorship substitution?         </p>

          LinkedIn. <br><br>Really, if he has no experience and is a wannabe, you a) won&#39;t get paid because the deal won&#39;t close, and b) get discouraged because you&#39;re wasting your time with the desperate and broke. <br><br>Tell him if he sees a deal to tell you about it and tell him *exactly* how you want it presented - not how he thinks it should be presented - and nothing more. <br><br>Outline the boundaries of the relationship with him early on.

          He&#39;s compliant. Teeing up the deals as I ask. Answering questions. Keeps bringing me new ones. Had him on simmer for a few months now, but he&#39;s adapting and getting closer to a deal that can work. I think he&#39;ll need a substitute sponsor. He is good with that. <br>Blocking and tackling...  he understands the relationship.         </p>

          Guy keeps bringing me deals. His deals are getting better, but he&#39;s stuck on the idea that he can&#39;t get them under contract unless he has financing lined up. What advice do you recommend we give these guys?        </p>

          If he&#39;s not going to be the sponsor, who cares? If he hasn&#39;t locked it up under K, then he doesn&#39;t&#39; have the money. <br><br>So tell him to find a more experienced sponsor and not him if he wants a deal to close. Period. Be firm but nice. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          From a broker earlier today (our discussion started last week): <br>&quot;I&#39;m sending five separate emails with nine separate attachments.  Please review the package when you get a moment and send me a commitment letter based on the info provided.<br>Our client is looking to move forward quickly.  Please build in a one percent fee for &lt;my Brokerage firm&gt;  in your offer.&quot;<br><br>My reply: <br>&quot;I&#39;ve looked through the many attachments you sent. We&#39;re putting our pencils down until we can get a clear picture of what exactly is needed, how it will be secured, and what it will be used for. <br><br>You’ve given me four different numbers for refinancing: $7.45mm as stated in the pro forma, $7.35mm as stated in the file you initiated online, and between $6mm - $6.5 mm as you stated verbally on the phone today. I don’t know how much the borrower needs, how the borrower plans to use the funds, the borrower’s exit strategy, or the condition of the current collateral. Your Web submission states 98% occupancy, but the July 2014 rent roll shows 113/ 345 units vacant (67% occupancy). And 6 months worth of operating data - all with a negative NOI - is not enough to get a good feel for the future performance of this asset. <br><br>Before we start talking about your brokerage fee or issuing a term sheet, I need to get direct with the borrower and understand what and who we’re working with. &quot;<br><br>Critique my response, please.  <br><br>It&#39;s a re-fi on a 345 unit multi-family in Jax. Asking for between $6 and $7.45 mm (he&#39;s provided four numbers). Current UPB $3.5 mm from a private lender (hard money) - it defaults in 60 days.  NOI is negative. Only 6 months of operating statements. Broker says owner has $3mm in capex into the property. <br><br>BTW: If I get this borrower direct on the phone, it&#39;ll be the first re-fi discussion I&#39;ve had with a borrower. What are the important points I need to be asking for?         </p>

          Different $ amounts requested, 6 month P&amp;L, no financials on the borrower, different occupancy levels on the rent roll vs his package, a focus on that fee agreement (apparently, there are two - one with the borrower and 1% fee he wanted me to include in a commitment letter). I told him very simply today that we need to be direct with the borrower. He&#39;s gone. <br><br>I think he was using the situation to garner as much fee as he could. Likely a legit borrower behind his search, but this broker doesn&#39;t strike me as acting in his client&#39;s best interest.         </p>

          Broker contacted / screened me as a lender for a &quot;high net worth&quot; client in need of a $7mm bridge loan for a multi-family property in Jacksonville Metro. Two mins in, I told him we&#39;re not interested in cutting him out, but will need to go direct with the borrower at some point soon. He asked how he will be compensated. I danced, explained why &quot;it depends&quot; on the deal. He started calling me &quot;sir,&quot; and explained he&#39;s interested in .5 point on yield spread. <br><br>What&#39;s reasonable compensation for brokers who bring us a loan, and how /when do we compensate them?<br><br>He&#39;s sorting down trough this 18 page property package and putting relevant deal info into my Web system as I type this.         </p>

          I realize this may be deep, but who better to ask than this group? There is no way the Dandrew &quot;five year window of opportunity&quot; was calculated without some thought to where the macro economy will be in five years. <br><br>I&#39;ve been modeling scenarios relative to a specific investment and this question came to mind: On exit, we want our cap rates to be competitive. What might be an acceptable way for us to lay our projected cap rate up against cap rates for competing investments in other asset classes? <br><br>I can pretty well estimate a cap rate for an isolated investment - say, a property we may consider financing. I will know, based on assumptions relative to that investment, what the slope should like like if the operator does their job correctly. That said: in five years, if bond rates yield 8% or mutual funds yield 15%, etc, our pool of potential buyers will change. <br>I&#39;m not suggesting that real estate is going to be less attractive, I&#39;m simply trying to develop a fact-based model for determining how our preferred asset classes stack up against other investment types over time and how I might give my clients (and myself) better situational awareness.  Am I making sense? <br><br>Maybe this is already done for us somewhere - in which case, I can settle for the fish. But I&#39;d prefer to know HOW to fish for this kind of info on my own.         </p>

          Dave<br><br>This is a very sophisticated question. Probably better explained on the AskDandrew Conference Call this week. <br><br>But real estate is usually benchmarked against the 10 Year Treasury.  This is seen as the “risk-free” rate as this is what real estate trades against. <br><br>So with that said, today the 10Y is 2.59%.  Today I also saw someone pay a 4% cap on an apartment complex (stabilized) in Manhattan. In the business we say this *”trading narrow”* to the 10 year.<br><br>(Hint: Most real estate today is *trading narrow* as its seen to serve many purposes, that ebing a safe haven away from savings confiscation, etc.)<br><br>The opposite of this would be AJ’s NNN fund. These typically *”trade wider”* to the 10 year because of location, population is smaller, and if the tenant moves out, you may be dark for a while. So that is also called the *”risk premium”*. <br><br>How the 10 year trades is a function of several things, most of which is government intervention via the Federal Reserve. Obviously, any intervention is the opposite of a true market where “*price discovery*” can’t be found as there are no true market buyers, but rather the government running the printing presses. <br><br>With that said, I would look at historical yields going back 10 years – again as I have with AJ’s deck – showing how these sub-assets trade (ie. “The 4 Food Groups”). <br><br>If this doesn’t answer your question, ask me on the call this Friday. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I follow this logic relative to the 10 yr. As with mortgage rates, the correlation seems (seemed) to work. And maybe that&#39;s the best we&#39;ve got. Easy to watch, but hard to predict (and even hard to believe).<br><br>In today&#39;s highly manipulated markets where buyers like the Chinese have pushed back from the table, the Fed eats its own product then tapers (sounds like Fed bulimia), and the petrodollar is at a higher risk for obsolescence, I&#39;m looking for what other signs (if any) we might look towards to help us understand (and maybe predict) where these rates are going. <br><br>True market has to eventually win out over market manipulation. I wonder where we&#39;ll see the correction first and how it will effect our clients. Maybe it&#39;ll happen too quickly to do anything about, and maybe I shouldn&#39;t be thinking about it, but if there&#39;s a marker I should be watching, I intend to be paying someone to check on it from time to time. There&#39;s both opportunity and risk there that bears watching. <br><br>It seems to me that yield is a function of risk or perceived risk in a true market. Yet, the 10 yr shows a downward trend - well over 1000 basis points - since June of 2004. I can&#39;t believe the market thinks there is less risk today than in 2004. When real estate presents higher risk, the cap rates rise. When confidence in and demand for American treasuries drops, the yield drops. Something isn&#39;t adding up. <br><br>Anyway... All this to say: I see some thinking going into things like AJ&#39;s NNN fund, the interest rates you&#39;re charging for your lending products, and the terms your setting. That isn&#39;t random. Certainly you and he are capitalizing on a unique risk reward balance you uncovered: the quality of coupons that class of NNN assets can pump into mailboxes (due to the classic risk premium you described above), against the stability of American small-town Midwestern culture - brilliant. I just wonder how you are (and by extension, we should be) reading and interpreting the tea leaves.         </p>

          There are a ton of people on LinkedIn waving &quot;I&#39;ve got money!&quot; flags around. I doubt many of them get hits. What&#39;s a better way to use LinkedIn to bring in the business?         </p>

          Sal and Dave,<br>What I have been doing is this. I have used the FDIC strategy and located banks who are having problems. Once I have the banks name and the name of those at that bank who are either in whole loans, asset disposal, Upper management, etc, I then take that information and go to Linked in.<br><br>I then do a search for the individuals and send out an invitation to connect. I actually setup a second Linkedin page dedicated to just this endeavor.<br><br>Now if the person does not have a profile and yes as hard it is to fathom in today&#39;s social media crazed world , I then will go back to the search box and input the banks name and city and state and from there I can usually find what I am looking for.<br><br>I find that the key to getting these individuals to respond is to have a summary section that focuses part on you and part on what you do.<br><br>These folks are looking for a reason to connect and to know that who they are dealing with is someone who has an alignment of interests.        </p>

          What would be the reason to have a syndicator act as property manager? I watched a continuing Ed where Sal and AJ interviewed a fund manager who said he would never consider an acquisition with third party property management involved. He wanted the sponsor/ syndicator to also manage to &quot;ensure alignment of interest.&quot; Arguably supporting that theory, the 10 point checklist to syndication infographic says &quot;all members sign a &#39;Property Management Agreement&quot; which essentilally appoints the syndicator as being responsible for for day to day operations. <br><br>I&#39;ve been an LP in syndications where the syndicator was neither the sponsor nor the property manager. In fact, in a case where the property manager was also the syndicator and the GP in the SPE that held the property, it became messy to remove them when the property management proved themselves to be incompetent. <br><br>I feel like I&#39;ve been burned by a single party acting as syndicator and property manager. I understand that a sponsor and/or syndicator with skin in the game would have more of an interest in a project&#39;s success, but third party property management seems more professional (esp with CPM or ARM), and easier to terminate if needed. <br><br>        </p>

          Dave<br><br>Personally speaking based on my lifetime experience, I *don’t* like the syndicator to be the property manager. It’s a conflict of interest. I think that you many have gotten that Continuing Ed mixed up as the Operator would replace with his own as he had his own accredited Property Management Company. If I recall correctly, that was a larger family office. Not a smaller investor like yourself. <br><br>Property Managers are supposed to manage the property and collect rents. And when you collect the rents, you touch the money. And when you touch the money, interesting things happen.  <br><br>Many a deal that we’ve funded has been from a weak, inexperienced Owner/Operator who wanted total control. <br><br>I like my rents to go to a lockbox. <br><br>Putting the Syndicator in the seat of a Property Manager is no different than putting the fox in charge of the hen house. <br><br>No REIT or Limited Partnership I know of would do such a thing. That is just not exercising good fiduciary responsibility or good practice in general. <br><br>And, because you know and love me to be cynical at best, paranoid at worst, there isn’t a single mom-and-pop property manager that doesn’t steal cash. In your more industrial towns with blue collar tenants who pay cash, it’s easy to skim a few off at the top. I’ve told my lie detector story many times. Because it’s true. <br><br>Property Managers follow a protocol, its not as easy as just collecting rents and listening to country music stories. They issue tax statements. Its important work.  <br><br>Furthermore, if you’re involved with a syndication with a lot of seminar students – and I’ve seen this happen with a guru who got into a lot of trouble – you’ll see that the student who syndicates wants to wear both hats. That is a desperate move and will always cause trouble. The student syndicator is in California but the property is in Texas. The rents are being sent to the syndicators PO Box *in California*. <br><br>Out of sight, out of mind is what the tenants will think…<br><br>*Lastly, if you’re doing these syndications, and if something goes wrong, you want to be able to point the finger at someone else rather than having that finger pointed at you.*<br><br>Please don’t get into the Property Management business. You’ve spent too much money to not do that. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I agree on all points. I believe the continuing ed was either a well established fund or a large family office as you said. I will personally never go near another deal where the syndicator is also the property manager - at least not at the levels we are operating at. The fox watching the hen house indeed. <br><br>Can you clarify the 10 point checklist to syndication infographic? Why does step 1 read that all members should sign a property management agreement?         </p>

          I once got into a screaming match with a “guru” who wanted money to fund these deals. His student who brought him the deal was going to be the chef, cook and bottlewasher and was also going to manage the property. <br><br>I asked him, “do you have any idea what the hell you are doing?” <br><br>Needless to say, he has 58 judgments against him now. And lots of gray hair. <br><br>On that infographic, if you are using a Tenant-In-Common structure, where all of the owners are on the title, they must all sign off on this. If you are using an dual-LLC structure, the managing member of the LLC that is set up as the Operator would sign for that.         </p>

          Thanks. Sometimes I think putting $150,000 on red would have paid off sooner, but if it was easy, everyone would be doing it. I just want everyone to be proud of their membership and affiliation.         </p>

          Sal - many are already proud of this membership and affiliation. DandrewMedia will be a bonus.         </p>
