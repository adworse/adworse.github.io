          I got the strategy but with some reservations: This is a non-performing loan (at UPB of $54,000,000).  In this strategy, the addition of $10,000,000 (or whatever) should bring the note to a performing stage, so that the borrower is able to pay Dandrew the 11% rate (at UPB of $65,000,000)...pretty big challenge for a borrower who was not able to pay the initial lender half interest rate and less amount of mortgage loan.…I think this strategy may pose a high risk for Dandrew of not getting paid and bring Dandrew in a situation of selling the note to recover the investment. Dandrew may take this risk because the value of the note got a 3x lift ….I still think the risk is high and the additional amount must play very well in the big picture for the strategy to work…what am I missing here??        </p>

          I am surprise about your response about where this Sample Sheet came from; this Sample Term Sheet in your Triage Educational System/Introduction/Sample Term Sheet for your students to learn from; that&#39;s why I&#39;ve posted my questions here; it would be very beneficial for us, if all obsolete information were updated or removed, so we don&#39;t learn or even worse apply the wrong information.<br><br>Thank you        </p>

          The Sample Term Sheet details out the upfront fees that borrower must pay as follows:<br><br>Loan Fee: Borrower shall pay a fee of Four Percent (4%) of the loan amount to Your Company at closing.<br>Broker: The Borrower shall pay a fee of (1.0%) at closing. Such amount(s) shall be disbursed from the Loan proceeds at Closing.<br><br>Application Fee: Upon the execution and return of this Term Sheet the Borrower shall deposit in the form of wire transfer or bank check a $20,000 fee payable to Lender which will be applied towards credit and background checks, a site inspection/evaluation of the property and processing fees. This fee is refundable less pursuit costs and expenses incurred by Lender in evaluating the Loan.<br><br>Expense Deposits: Upon acceptance of a formal Loan Offer and scheduling of the loan closing, the<br>Borrower shall deposit in the form of wire transfer or bank check, an expense deposit of $40,000. This deposit will be attributed to the costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection with the processing of the Loan (whether or not the Loan closes) including, without limitation, underwriting expenses and legal counsel expenses. This fee will be refundable less pursuit costs and expenses incurred by the Lender in evaluating the Loan, excepting the Borrower decision not to proceed to closing with the Lender.<br><br>Please help me better understand these fees: <br>1.	 Are these fees still valid or need revision? (Term Sheet dated Feb 2011)<br>2.	The Loan fee of 4% and Broker fee of 1% is paid to us (our company). Since not all of us are Brokers, can we use another term for “Broker” such as “Intermediary”? This is a legal document and terms must reflect our position in this transaction. Also, my understanding is that 4% will go to Dandrew’s Partners and 1% will go to us.  Is this correct?<br>3.	Will the borrower need to pay the same Application Fee of $20,000 and Expense Deposits of $40,000 regardless of the amount of the loan?<br>4.	The Application and Expense fees are refundable less pursuit costs and expenses incurred by the Lender in evaluating the Loan. Can you provide an estimate the pursuit costs in evaluation the loan? <br>Thank you. <br>        </p>

          Just a quick suggestion for Module 5/ Performing Notes: When you define LTV or CLTV on the board, I thing the definition should be Loan (or Debt) divided by Value (or As-Is), not the other way around. In your example, the CLTV of 90% can be obtained if you divide the $90,000 (loan) to $100,000 ( As-Is Value)        </p>

          Sal, I have a project that looks very promising due to low investment risk and high reward: <br>$5 MM loan request (33% LTC), where my client and his JV Partner, David Ingram, the principal from SECSA (Solution Equity Capital, SA) will provide $14.8 M (66% LTC); David analyzed the project over the last 3 months and he is ready to invest $14.8 MM, but they are running short of $ 5MM. David is getting a great deal for his investment (50% Equity, debt paid back in 15 years, with interest as 50% Equity). I’ve spoken with David twice, and he is ready to finalize the due diligence and close within 2 months. My client wants to purchase a 320 acre land in Sterling, CT and develop:<br><br>a.  A top-of-the-line recreational vehicle park (RV), which will have more than 500 units, both open and also developed with chalets and recreational vehicles already on site.<br>b.  A major music and art festival event facility that can host more than 24,000 people at a time.<br><br>• Purchase Price (Land) = 5.5 M<br>• Development = $14.8 M<br>• After Development Value = $80 M based on NOI of $10 M <br>• Loan Request = $5 MM (1st position) in two tranches, half to purchase the land, and the 2nd half of the loan will be used after the RV park is built.  <br>• Sponsor/ JV Partner (SECSA) Contribution = $14.8 MM <br>• Collateral = $18M (50% equity ownership) as follows: approximately 110 acres, where the primary RV Park will be constructed. Total immediate value of collateral is 2.25 MM (50%) of the land value, and 6 MM for the 50% equity of the project.  By the time the second half of the mezzanine loan will be deployed, collateral value of the land portion will rise to 8 million dollars, and collateral value of the equity portion will rise to 14 million dollars.<br>• Term = 18 months<br>The development of the property will include, among many additional items: A complete rebuild of a 60,000 square foot indoor event center, Construction of more than 400 campsites and chalets, A complete aquatic center, Stage and concert facilities ,All necessary infrastructure (water, roads, septic, electric, Wi-Fi and communications, etc.)<br>Please let me know if you have any interest, so I could send you the info needed<br>        </p>

          I am getting the bios, Term Sheets, and everything else in a day or two; so far they&#39;ve used First Choice as their debt provider and used their own cash as skin in the game; as their company expands, they need to bring in an investor to free some of their capital. <br>A conference call with the main sponsor may be a good idea, so you could ask all the questions.<br>Fulga        </p>

          JV/Mezz Loan: Mining/Exploration Canada: Graphite, Titanium, Gold, Silver and Other Minerals  <br><br>Sponsor has a 25-year ironclad lease on the 8,200 acre land located in Canada that has various types of mineralization that were shown in the previous years of exploration.  Over $7 mil has been spent to date to drill 146 holes that were tested all positive; the most important asset is the presence of Graphite (mineral that will revolutionize the chip technology), Titanium, Gold, Silver, Copper, and many others.   The land is valued today at more than $50 billion, and was divided in several zoning for mining: <br><br>M Zone: Significant Sedex type polymetallic precious metal massive sulphide deposit. Drilled indicated <br>and inferred resource of 1.2 million tons grading 9.85 oz. /t Silver, 6.06 % Zinc, 2.67% Lead, 0.06% Copper<br>and .026 oz. /t Gold down to the 1300 foot level.  Screen Analysis was done on 2 drill holes and the Silver<br>assays averaged 20 ounces/T and the Gold came out at 3 grams/t. Based on the type of deposit and the geology<br>data, experts believes the M Zone has 3 times the resource indicated.<br><br>Project would start with mining the M zone. Potential Gross Annual Revenue (USD) (Ag, Zn, Pb, Au, Cu) <br>= $ 134,806,600 <br><br>G Zone: Graphitic Argillite and Titanium: <br><br>Deep penetration electromagnetic survey (six drill holes) as well an Airborne EM survey picked the huge<br> Graphitic Argillite Horizon ranging in width from 46 to 149 feet.      <br>Samples of core were submitted to SGS Research, Lakefield and assayed up to 2% Graphitic Carbon.  <br>Important to note that this horizon contains 14 pounds/Ton of Titanium which can be easily recovered by floatation producing a high grade Titanium concentrate.     <br><br>C Zones: The C Lake area continues to return very encouraging gold and base metal assays associated with<br> Arsenopyrite in structural and volcanic terrains. Recent drilling has intersected Gold values up to 13 g/t over 0.5m, <br>8 g/t over 3 m, 2.4 g/t over 8.8 m and 4.3 g/t over 1.4 m. Sampling from trenches assayed 0.5 oz. /t Gold.<br><br>Current market value of the land = $50 billion<br>Skin in the game = land ($50 billon)+ $20 million<br>Loan Request = $200 million for mining <br><br>I know this is another “Big Elephant” project you are not interested in, but this may be big deal for an investor you may know, who has money and wants to secure his future and the future of his children/grandchildren. I am bringing these deals to you first, Sal before giving them away. <br>By the way, the NY city construction projects are going on pretty well so far; we’ll see!<br>        </p>

          Fulga <br><br>Give this one away. Its not for anyone I know. Actually, be careful because a lot of fraud happens with these deals. I wouldn&#39;t be pitching these deals really. Here&#39;s usually how they blow up and rip off unsuspecting investors. I&#39;ve seen this so many times in oil and this is the same way. <br><br>First,  you find a giant patch of dirt with no oil in it, have your engineers declare a trillion or two in recoverable reserves, issue stock against that valuation, sell enough stock to buy yourself a new Bentley, Rolls Royce and a Gulfstream V jet. Then you buy a few drill rigs for show, syphon a few hundred billion to the cayman&#39;s, reassess your trillion dollar fields and realize there&#39;s no oil, and poof... File Chapter 7. <br><br>Same with minerals. I know, I know, your deal is great. But they all follow the same script. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Where *exactly* are you with the NYC deal. Has it been papered yet? <br><br>         </p>

          Fulga,<br>I&#39;ve seen a lot of these deals lately. They all seem to talk about revenues yet when you ask certain questions, you always get the same answers which are, we just started drilling or mining, were in beginning stages, we&#39;ve spent a lot of money on dd and land studies, feasibility studies, etc.<br><br>Many of these are small companies and the question I always pose is, if this land and it&#39;s tracts are so heavy with the commodity being mined for, how come the larger players with larger capital resources don&#39;t know about it. The old saying of they aren&#39;t making any more land comes into play.<br><br>The other question posed always is how much additional money can fit into the capital stack and where do you want us comes into play as in any deal.<br><br>The usual answer is we need 100% funding. The answer to that is not going to happen. If they had the funds to do these expensive studies why do they not have any equity to put in?<br><br>Why do I see these deals? Because I&#39;m in Dallas and Fort Worth, home of many of these companies and they all want huge amounts of equity capital.<br><br>These deals are known as Dreams of fools because only unsophisticated people looking for the once in a life time Microsoft type score invest in these.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Aspen CO: Land at Ski Lodge, base of ski resort (“ski in/ski out/ 14 luxury properties”)<br><br>Everything about this deal is LOCATION: 3.5 square miles land at the famous Aspen CO ski lodge. The last piece of land in this area has recently become available and it is located at the base of the ski resort.<br>Sponsor wants to acquire the land and build 14 luxury homes, about 6,000 SqFt each.  After years of heavy fight with the building department (very difficult to get permits in that area), permits have been obtained.  The land is appraised at $38 mil, and the gross revenue estimated at about $200 mil. <br><br>Sponsor needs a JV to buy the land, with 100% financing, and in turn he is willing to provide equity as per lender’s terms. Once the land is purchased, sponsor will have no issue to raise the capital for construction. Developer Bio /Proforma will be provided if there is interest in this type of JV (100% financing with equity as per lender’s terms).<br>Here are the figures:<br>• Land acquisition: $35,000,000<br>• Total projected building cost: $68,162,600.00<br>• Total projected development cost: $103,162,600.00<br>• Projected sales price: $2,500.00 per square feet or $13,800,000.00 per home<br>• Total sales revenue: : $193,200,000.00<br>• Net: $72,649,000.00<br>• ROI: 70% or $50,854,580.00<br><br>Is Dandrew interested in this type of JV?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Fulga, why don&#39;t you become the JV Partner yourself? Use your intellectual capital to leverage your skill sets to captain the deal. Your intellectual capital has a value just as goodwill has a value in a business sale. Anyone can get a JV Partner who sits around like a puppet and brings no real value, how many people get a JV Partner who actually can do what you do, I do, etc.<br><br>Provide your services as a consultant in the deal, handling the heavy lifting for an equity piece on the back end. Prep the financial package for a $5,000.00 fee paid upfront.<br><br>Think you can&#39;t do it? don&#39;t forget, you have Sal to answer your questions here.         </p>

          Fulga,<br>Call Cooley LLP in Broomfield, Colorado at 720 566-4000, tell them you have this deal that needs a JV Partner in a Ski Resort. They are a law firm that has clients that are extremely wealthy, some I believe are motion picture actors and actresses, pro athletes, Fortune 500 CEO&#39;s who invest as passive investors and Cooley provides the legal in the deal.        </p>

          Real Estate Investing Conference New York City April 24:<br><br>Sal, I did attend today the NY City investor conference as an Exhibitor, and I had the opportunity to give my 2 min “Elevator Speech” (I was waiting for your help on that…I think you have forgotten about me); I was really impressed meeting investors who came not only from US, but from Europe, and Asia, just for this event! <br><br>The funny part of my NY city adventure was trying to sell my financial services to Ziel Feldman, the founder of HFZ Capital Group, who purchased the notes securing 303 East 51st Street, 20 West 40th Street, The Setai at Wall Street (40 Broad Street) and One Madison Avenue, as well as properties located at 11 East 68th Street and 11 Beach Street, all located in New York City. I did not know about him and his investing portfolios when I explained my Mezzanine $2 mil-$10 mil loans…but I had a very good laugh afterwards. <br><br>The interesting part to share with you is that the CEO of a capital creation company was looking for Equity Partners for a sky rise building in NY City. I told him that I was interested, and we exchanged business cards…more to come<br>        </p>

          Sal, I do take your concerns seriously. Although I feel pretty strong in analyzing commercial real estate deals, I am pretty weak in JV because I am a beginner in this area. As I said before I have many JV deals, and that’s why I need your help in guiding me here. Before I call the sponsor to ask the hard questions, I need to know what these questions would be, so thank you for clarifying that.<br><br>I was also sure that this was a Purchase JV, not a construction one, since the sponsor is using somebody else to pay for the construction expense; so as you see…it’s a learning curve. <br><br>I will get all the info you requested, but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s fair to use your time if you cannot benefit from this deal, but all you want is to help me, which is greatly appreciated. <br>        </p>

          I have a multifamily portfolio deal in Dallas -Houston, TX, that pass all our Pre-qualification questions (e.g. skin in the game, NOI can service the debt, 91%  occupancy, sponsor experience, etc.), but the loan amount required is $314,000,000. Since the loan amount is huge, I have advised the sponsor to try breaking down the portfolio in groups of buildings, so there would be several loans.  To further assist the sponsor, I need to know:<br>1.  What would be the max loan amount Dandrew would provide? This would help us grouping the assets, to fit Dandrew’s criteria).<br>2. Is Dandrew-Sal interested in a JV? <br>Thank you<br>        </p>

          Fulga:<br><br>We need to clarify a few things: <br><br>1.  That pass all *our* Pre-qualification.<br>Who is “our”? Fulga’s or Dandrew’s pre-qualifications? I’m only interested in the 5 Data Points for each asset at first. Nothing more. <br><br>2.  What is his experience managing this asset class? Did you ask for a Deal Sheet from him? <br><br>3.  Where are these assets coming from? Are you direct to the seller, who I imagine should be a lender or a large REIT? <br><br>4.  How long have they been looking for capital for this deal? <br><br>5.  Do you have – on an Excel spreadsheet – the assets that are included into this big trade? <br><br>If the numbers and experience add up, anything is possible. Right now these larger deals don’t usually flow downstream to the students as they are picked up by larger firms who have a lower cost of capital. Which makes me wonder about why they are coming to you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Wow, that is a hefty number, what I am wondering is after several firms co fund this thing, will there be any meat left on the bone and just how much the monthly debt service payments are going to be at that price.<br><br>Fulga I would pay real close attention to the sources and uses statements, do they align with the story of the deal? Also let me tell you about how multi family works in Dallas.<br><br>You have South Dallas, North Dallas, Dallas, Uptown Dallas, and Oak Lawn. Dallas is comprised of 22 independent cities within Dallas County and each is a market of their own, with market conditions that all differ.<br><br>The areas I mentioned above are where all the multi family properties are in The city of Dallas.<br><br>South Dallas is an area that is not highly desirable based upon the market. Rents are somewhere around section 8 levels and can drop to a low of $300.00. This area is a war zone on steroids and there is at this time, zero upside to owning there. No one is coming in and investing any new money into infrastructure.<br><br>The other areas are more desirable and some properties can command rents of $2000.00 plus per month. My guess is that the collateral for this loan is going to have to be somewhere between $800 and $1200 per month or better to make debt stack payments.<br><br>The thing that makes Dallas attractive for the non-wealthy is that Texas in itself as well as Dallas and Houston us that us what us called debtors heaven. This means that those who have screwed up financially can move here and literally start over.<br><br>You can buy a car with no credit to severely damaged credit, can lease purchase a home even if you&#39;ve never paid a bill a day in your life for about $750.00 up front.<br><br>No one cares about people&#39;s pasts it seems. Very bad business practices.        </p>

          Sal, I am happy to find out that we can go so high in loan value with you, so I will get the answers to your questions. Regarding why somebody would come to Fulga with such a huge project, my answer is: Maybe I am doing something right. <br><br>I have also a request for a $1.7 Billion loan, where a group of investors would purchase a chain of high rated restaurants across US; I did not believe it first, so I requested all kind of documents, and I’ve received all the proof needed that they were serious about it (hundreds of legal pages). I’ve spent hours over the phone with the main sponsor to find out details about the deal, and we even talked about structuring scenarios. <br> <br>…so YES Sal, we are getting loans requests for huge amount of money, but I did not take them seriously, until now. <br>I have also on my desk loans requests for more than $50 mill each: 9 JVs, 8 development projects, and 2 multifamily purchases in London. <br>        </p>

          We Are All Here To Learn:<br><br>Thank you Molly for defending my case; as I stated in my Comments, we are at the beginning of our journey, and since there are not two deals alike, it’s important to understand why a deal would be a Go or No Go, so we don’t waste our time or Sal’s time; each type of deal must be given a special consideration, and I strongly believe that the opinion exchange between Sal and I was great and beneficial for all of us, so I would like to thank Sal as well for his time and patience. <br>Molly your statement was exactly my point: We simply want to understand our deals and what makes them a good or bad candidate for the capital investment. Sal was willing to share with me his words of wisdom in his responses to my questions and I hope we all did enjoy our exchange of opinions. <br>I think we need deal assessment reviews in the Comment section, because there is a lot to be learned from them, and I believe all of us could greatly benefit from it. Asking questions of understanding cannot harm anybody, but help. <br>Thank you Molly and thank you Sal!         </p>

          Re:Re:Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>You stated that: “The main issue why this is a pass is because one of the main tenants leases expire in 2015”….so let me rephrase what it has been said about this tenant: “Siemens Electronics: Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement; Gross Income = $389,389”<br><br>So the lease will be renewed.  Would a new lease change your mind or there it will be something else? <br>Also, please explain why you don’t consider the cross-collateral as a very strong decision maker.  You can easily sell the shares and recover the capital if things go sour. The cross-collateral is practically yours.  I really need to better understand your reasoning. <br>I greatly appreciate your time and feedback on this deal, but as deals start flowing in my office, it’s important to understand the specifics on why deals won’t pass. Thank you again Sal.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>So we’re back to the question. Will Siemens Electronics renew after 2015? Are they “pregnant” or not? If so, have the renewed formally and how long is the lease term? What&#39;s changed in the past 24 hours since I believe you stated they weren&#39;t going to renew? This is something that doesn&#39;t happen overnight. It happens over a protracted period of negotiations. <br><br>(And any new &quot;news&quot; will spook investors like us and is a reason why we put these deals on ice for a period of time for the truth to come out...)<br><br>I think cross collateral is great, but if I’m promising an investor a coupon each month, it doesn’t make sense for any lender to make a loan against something – albeit cross collateralized – that will lose value in less than 9 months because a major tenant is moving out.<br><br>Cross collateralization is not a *reason* to make a loan itself, but rather an extra comfort that your over secured should anything go bad. Its also an excuse for a Federal Bankruptcy Judge to nullify the cross-collateralization clause as it can been seen as being &quot;predatory&quot; in some states because we made a loan that was cross collateralized knowing that a) the tenant was moving out and, b) as a result, they didn&#39;t have income to make the debt payments, and c) we foreclosed on the collateral. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Fulga, I am enjoying reading this, however, I am confused, do you want this to be funded or not??? As I told you on our call, you need to have additional capital providers. The number one reason capital providers got into trouble back a few years ago was by just simply writing checks for investments that were not worthy of funding.<br><br>Sal has said its a pass, he has stated that here and you acknowledged it as such. He gave you his reasons and right now at this point, I fail to see why you simply do not look elsewhere for funding.<br><br>At this point from my view and I&#39;m going to say the view of others here that your trying to call Sal to the mat and make him look bad. Sal has said in the past that 1) he is not obligated to fund any intermediaries deal just because they spend money with him and 2) he will not be strong armed into funding anyone&#39;s deal.        </p>

          I don&#39;t think Fulga or anyone wants to make Sal look bad.  We are all grateful for his expert training.  We simply want to understand our deals and what makes them a good or bad candidate for his  capital investment.  We all want and need deals to go through.  You bring up a good point ...is it Jim? Capital consulting team.  How can we make the deal work by getting other capital providers to spread the risk or is it just a bad deal?  That is all we want to know. Why it is a bad deal and or what we can do to make it better or to work?        </p>

          Thank you Sal.  Happily I do understand what you are saying.  It has taken some time but I think I am getting it.  Your capital providers are guaranteed a coupon, income check, on a monthly basis and you can&#39;t provide that if the value is depleted due to a vacancy.  We don&#39;t go by a promise of a renewal.  Only a signed agreement will do. (pregnant test positive)         </p>

          Molly, I appreciate your feed back. I understand members wanting to understand the why and why not. I also understand wanting to know why a deal gets passed on. Were all here to learn.<br><br>However, when someone turns a post into something personal and uses strong words like &quot; I don&#39;t get you Sal&quot;, that&#39;s when I feel like I do and why I came across the way I did.<br><br>I think AskDandrew is a great forum for learning not only from Sal but one another. I value everyone here as a professional.        </p>

          Fulga, there are some very creative things that can be done here. The best strategy is to place the three free and clear properties into a LLC and refinance the properties with the new LLC assuming the debt, using income from all three to pay the debt.<br><br>Use the refinance proceeds to pay off the one property and sell it to the new LLC. The new LLC now has increased value and then sell off each space in the foreclosed property to the tenants. Owning is always more attractive than leasing.<br><br>Use the sale proceeds to retire all the debt and the LLC has increased it&#39;s value a lot.        </p>

        <p>
          Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>As stated in my Comment Post, I did not post this deal with the purpose to be approved, but rather to better understand your position on situations where there is an asset that is purchased at 30% below market value, request for financing is 100% and there is cross-collateral owned free and clear that could be easily sold to recover the capital. There are great discussion points that we could all benefit from, so let’s start by answering your questions the best I can:<br><br>1.  Your sponsor is asking for 100% of the Purchase Price. They just merely increased or had the appraisal clock in at a level that would make it look like it would be financed at 70%. This is why we ask for the 5 Data Points as we can see through the deal clearly.<br>Answer: If I understand your response correctly, we should be skeptical of deals where the sponsor does not have “skin in the game”, even if there is an appraisal report showing more than 25% equity, and there is solid cross-collateral. So far 50% our sponsors request capital for assets purchased at a discount with equity higher than 25%, and present to us appraisal reports to confirm the equity. I know the answer to this is:  “it depends” on the deal…market tier, class asset, sponsor experience, etc… My take on this is that the Exit Strategy is a good decision factor on deals like this. If one can easily recover the capital with minimum risk, than the deal merits further consideration in my opinion. When I see “Refinancing” as an Exit Strategy, I am skeptical because we all know how expensive and painful the foreclosure process is. As an investor, I like deals where I can get the Deed of a cross- collateral asset that I could sell fast and recover my capital in case the sponsor defaults…but this is just me! This sponsor has 3 assets owned free and clear in NY and FL as a cross-collateral, and that’s the main reason I presented this deal for discussion.  <br><br>I know we should be skeptical about an appraisal value provided by sponsor, however, the validity of the value is always confirmed as part of the “due diligence” as the expense of the sponsor.  <br><br>To conclude this, please elaborate further so we could all learn: How should we approach deals where a sponsor requests 100% financing when they are buying back their property/note from the bank at a 25% and up discount? They provide an Appraisal report from a credible company proving the fair market value. Shall we say “No”, upfront even if there is cross-collateral? Shall we consider other factors as tier market, class asset, etc. in addition to cross-collateral? <br><br>2.  Regarding “Where are the 5 data points? It seems as though you broke a few rules here and did it the “Fulga Way”, <br>Answer: Sorry if you feel that I broke the rules, because the 5 data points were presented in the narrative as follows: <br><br>1.  Current NOI: $468,000<br>2.  Proforma NOI: No Idea (it was really stupid for me to say that: I should have stated in a different way; good point to beat on me! On my defense, this was a deal for discussion, not for approval. Anyway, the Infographic states that Pro forma is a “TYPICALLY a COMPLETE LIE”, but I really understand its merit. <br>3.  Debt stack: $7,800,000 (so there is no overleverage) <br>4.  Sources and Uses: Purchase<br>5.  Exit Strategy: Refinancing and contingency as Cross-collateralization <br><br>3.  As you know, REOs don’t have any loans, so when you mention 2 loans can be combined confuses me.<br>Answer: As stated in my Comment, the sponsor would like to get an additional loan, if possible. Since there are 3 assets as cross- collateral, we could “refinance” one of them, and the sponsor would use the money to add value to the subject property. This was very appealing to me that made the deal stronger.<br><br>4.  Regarding the tenant: “Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement.” This is the equivalent of asking a woman if she is pregnant or not: Has it been renewed or not? That is a very critical part of this. Only 2 answers will suffice. If they didn’t renew, that will break the deal.<br>Answer: Lessons learned: We should have just stated: Lease Expires in 2015, without including that there is an agreement for renewal…or present fact for the Lease Renewal. Good point!<br><br>We are at the beginning of this journey with you, and as you stated so often in your videos, one needs to date before marrying ...so we are in the dating period to better understand the deals that should NOT be submitted. We receive many deals where the 5 points look pretty good, but instead of submitting the deal immediately, we are digging further, and we see issues that surface.  Honestly, I understand why many deals submitted with the 5 data points get rejected. I think that additional points should be added to pre-qualify a deal…that would make the process more efficient….but again…I just started this business and have a lot to learn. <br><br>Thank you for your help.        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I understand what you are talking about here. Let’s remember a few things, and I have to continue to remind myself that I’m dealing with a highly-educated engineer here, so we can communicate correctly. You like the facts, or what someone tells you are “facts”. More on that in a moment.<br> <br>1. We created the 5 Data Points as a *pre-qualification only* to see if we should have a “second date”. More info from this is adding too many ingredients to the soup and can spoil (or fool) the Intermediary easily who is newer. <br><br>2. My answers are to train you and everyone to *think critically about deals*.<br><br>My old boss at GS once told me “always assume the guy on the other side of the trade is looking to [fool] you”. <br>The fact that they want 100% of purchase price is OK, *but it’s the basis we don’t know*. Appraisals are not taken seriously by anyone. <br><br>So what do we do? We look at the a) *UPB* (Unpaid Principal Balance) and, b) *price-per-pound*, or what similar assets have traded at. (The subscription website you showed me would give you this very important info, by the way!). That will tell us if we’re really getting in at a good basis or not. <br><br>Don’t get me wrong, we’ve funded 100% of DPOs before and we’re fine with that so long as, among other things, we’re in at a *good basis*. <br><br>Put another way, if I had a 1 oz Gold Coin, we know that these are currently going for ~$1,400 an ounce that I could buy, I’m almost certain you would fund me at a purchase price (“basis”) at $400, $500, maybe even $900 using that gold as collateral. <br><br>But if I were to tell you I was buying this for $1200, you may not be so excited with the basis I’m getting this deal at and want me to put some fresh equity in. <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Fulga, I enjoyed our conversation today. However, let me say this. Even know my firm is not in the business of acquiring properties, I have bought some in the past. Sometimes, if a property is sold at 30 cents on the dollar it&#39;s because that&#39;s all it really is worth in today&#39;s quick sale dollars.<br><br>This is a strategy hard money lenders will use to determine what a property is worth to them Some hard money lenders understand an appraisal isn&#39;t worth the paper it&#39;s written on, so they will use quick sale value.<br><br>To those reading this and wonder what that term means, it means the following. If a property has a future value or after repair value of $100,000.00 and it&#39;s purchased for $45,000.00 or 45% of future value! then what can a hard money lender sell it for right now if they had to foreclose. <br><br>If you said $45,000.00 your incorrect because this is what was paid for it, not what it&#39;s actually worth. If you bought correctly because you knew what you were doing, you&#39;d have a property worth more than you paid, if your lacking knowledge, you&#39;d pay too much.<br><br>I have an idea how to structure this so it could be funded. Give a few minutes to digest this.        </p>

          Re:Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse <br><br>Sal, I don’t get you, sorry! <br>Why the UPB should be part of qualifying this deal? Aren’t the Fair Market Value (FMV), LTV and Exit Strategy what matter, so one could assess the risks and mitigate them if needed to recover the capital? Everything in life and business is risk management and mitigation, so one could avoid doing damage control; that’s why I consider Refinancing as an Exit strategy pretty risky because foreclosure as a mitigation is very painful and costly…but I love cross-collateral where I can get the shares of the company (or the deed) and I can easily recover my money.  <br><br> What would I care if the sponsor bought the property at a peak or valley market and the UBP is higher or lower TODAY? All I should care is how much I can sell the asset and / or the cross-collateral TODAY.<br>Regarding everything else you said…so true. But please believe me…I am hard to get by being fooled by people (I die hard, if you saw the movie).<br>So, is this deal a NO?        </p>

          Fulga, <br>You make excellent points. My answers have to do with my knowledge of the market. The market is pragmatic, and everything here is technical.<br><br>Let me explain: <br><br>Technically speaking, yes, a refinance into a conduit loan is an exit strategy. <br><br>Pragmatically speaking, however; if banks aren’t lending right now refinance is a bad option. Only an outright sale. <br><br>The main issue why this is a *pass* is because one of the main tenants leases expire in 2015. Then what? Who do they have lined up for this specialized space? Anyone different would incur large T&amp;I expenses. Then there are rent concessions. <br><br>This isn&#39;t as easy as getting a conduit or larger syndicated loan for a retail, or multi-family asset. Those happen every day. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          How to Get Deals:<br>I just attended the Real Estate Investing Conference in Manhattan, NY and I would like to share with you two important lessons learned. Please note that all speakers (about 15) are well known successful real estate investors/business owners who made a fortune in the financing world.<br>When asked what the key elements of their success were, the answer was:<br>1.  Most of the leads in the financing world come from “relationships”; online, and offline marketing comes next. Obviously it takes time and determination to go out and get a hand shake, but it’s worth it! This was Sal’s advice to me as well: get out of your comfort zone and reach out to bankers, brokers, attorneys, landlords…deals will come exponentially.<br>2.  Never lose focus on what you try to achieve every day, so each time you get distracted, bring yourself back to the task. This is nothing but a mind game to change a habit.<br>All these sound like “common sense”, but it was great to hear it again from successful business owners who started their financial journey like us.<br>Good Luck!<br>Fulga<br>        </p>

          Wonderful Fulga! <br><br>The key takeaway that I think is most important here are *relationships*. <br><br>Let me put this into perspective. None of you on here would buy anything from Dandrew Media if you didn&#39;t have a relationship with us. <br><br>So important today in a world where people are getting blitzed with Social Media. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          To both Sal and James Re: Retail Center in Centennial, Colorado<br><br>Thank you for your responses, your advice would have worked 100% if Time would not Be of Essence: the loan has reached its maturity and there is no time for the land to be sold (Hot Issue as mentioned). Please see my initial comments: The Land sell was the sponsor’s initial strategy, and it was listed last year for $4.5 mil and was under contract for $3.5 mil for 10 months. The deal fell through after 10 months because the buyer did not qualify for the mortgage. Meanwhile the sponsor’s loan has matured and his attorney is finalizing the note buy back at a discount.<br><br>This is a deal where the sponsor is desperate to get the loan to repurchase the note and has enough collateral to minimize the risk. The exit strategy explained included the land sell as a contingency to refinancing.  The only concern here is the fact that the cross-collateral assets are 2 pieces of land in an industrial area, but of a great value that could be sold to experiences developers.<br><br>In case you missed these details, I will ask again: interested?? <br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>No vacant lands as collateral against a retail asset.

          Fulga, I would sell one of the parcels of land and use those funds to pay down the note. One big question that comes to mind is what are they doing to increase occupancy above 52%. What is their competitive advantage in the market above 52% of the market. <br><br>The project seems to be heading to overleverageville. Sometimes the answer to the problem is not in adding new capital to the capital stack in existence.<br><br>If they own the land outright, I would place both parcels into a separate LLC and syndicate the deal to two developers, and lend the proceeds to the other entity with a long term note with low interest payments that would be lower than taking on new capital.<br><br>Make the money that&#39;s readily available work for them.        </p>

No one would believe a student would have $25mm”<br>My interpretation of your response is that we present ourselves as “students” while calling banks, brokers, etc. I would imagine nobody would spend time dealing with students, and the whole purpose of the Credibility Kit is to prove the world that we are serious players. <br>Please help me understand if there is any update in the program that I am not aware of.<br>Thank you<br>        </p>

          I am going to because I have Sal&#39;s blessing post something later today about my experiences in being in a live deal with Sal. I will say that the last time I looked, Sal has made it very clear that the POF when issued were only for $2M and was only available to Private Equiteer and Arbitragers.<br><br>One thing I have learned about Sal is like it or hate it, he is brutally honest and tells it like it is. I don&#39;t sense that Sal refers to anyone as just a student and feels that  no one would believe any Intermediaries wouldn&#39;t have that kind of money, but lets face reality here. Not one Intermediary here has $25,000,000.00 in their bank account.<br><br>This is my two cents<br><br>I        </p>

          For those who opened your LLC in a different state, please be aware that there is more to just filling your LLC and getting the EIN. Make sure your business is in compliance with both states laws, see below a letter from my attorney, that applies for NY State: <br><br>My concern is if your business qualifies to operate in New York.  Foreign qualifying is simply registering to do business in a state other than the one in which you incorporated or formed your LLC. That’s because corporations and LLCs are considered domestic only in their state of incorporation.  For example, you formed your LLC in Delaware, as a result, it is only domestic in Delaware and considered a foreign LLC in other states such as New York. <br><br>Does your LLC needs to foreign qualify?<br>There are many factors used in determining the need to foreign qualify. While different states have different criteria for transacting business, consider the following:<br>•     Does your company have a physical presence in the state?<br>•     Does your company have employees in the state?<br>•     Does your company accept orders in the state?<br>•     Does your company have a bank account in the state? <br>Most of our clients that answer yes to any of these statements have us help them foreign qualify their business in the appropriate states.<br><br>Consequences of not foreign qualifying<br>Since there are additional costs—including initial and ongoing fees from both your state of incorporation and state of qualification—you may wonder if the process is really necessary. But state laws require foreign corporations and LLCs doing business within their borders to foreign qualify, and the consequences of not doing so outweigh the costs:<br>•     You may lose access to that state’s court system. For example, if an employee or customer within a state in which you do business sues your company, you can’t defend the lawsuit in that state, because your company is not recognized as a business there. This means that you personally could be sued, and that could put your personal assets at risk.<br>•     You may face fines, penalties and back taxes for the time in which your company did business within a state without being foreign qualified there. Some of these fines can be thousands of dollars a year. <br><br>We can help you get your LLC qualified to operate in New York.  Once qualified, you will be required to publish in two newspapers a copy of the articles of organization or a notice related to the formation of the LLC.  Below is taken directly from the NY Secretary of State web site: <br>New York Certificate of Publication<br>Section 206 of the New York State Limited Liability Company Law requires that within 120 days after the effectiveness of the initial articles of organization, a limited liability company (LLC) must publish in two newspapers a copy of the articles of organization or a notice related to the formation of the LLC. The newspapers must be designated by the county clerk of the county in which the office of the LLC is located, as stated in the articles of organization. After publication, the printer or publisher of each newspaper will provide you with an affidavit of publication. A Certificate of Publication, with the affidavits of publication of the newspapers attached, must be submitted to the New York Department of State<br>        </p>

          I am getting many requests for equity deals financing. To be efficient in the pre-qualification/deal submission process, I need a better understanding of the Dandrew Partners terms (e.g. only 1st position, etc.); My opinion is that the 5 pre-qualification points may not be good enough to submit these type of deals, and I don&#39;t want to waste anybody&#39;s time.  If your answer is “it depends”, please provide an example of an equity deal that you will finance with detailed explanation on why this equity deal gets qualified.<br>Thank you <br>        </p>

          To Everybody<br>Many deals posted in Dandrew Comunity require buyers aligned (e.g. Performing-Non Performing Notes/REOs). So far I rejected all these deals because my buyer list is not completed yet. Please advise what is the scope of your Comment?  Are you asking Sal to qualify your deal before sending it to your investor? As far as I know, Sal does not buy anything (the best case scenario, he may be an equity partner).<br>Thank you for your time to respond, it will bring light to a lot of confusion; greatly appreciated! <br>Fulga<br>        </p>

          Fulga, I always reference the fact that you have to listen and hear what Sal says on the calls. I&#39;ve heard atleast twice out of the previous three Friday calls where Sal has said &quot; We don&#39;t buy things we lend on them&quot;. Your comment will hit home for many I would think.        </p>

          Hi Fulga, for the most part, we are financiers seeking commercial real estate projects to fund either as debt and/or equity. Therefore, we need to prospect for buyers and borrowers. If you are an experienced operator, and you have the equity, you might be able to bring a deal of your own account to Dandrew. However, I would confirm this with Sal in order to avoid wasting any time. <br><br>        </p>

          Student Housing Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.<br><br> I am not quite sure if you are interested in equity deals, but here it goes: <br><br>Description: 316 unit Class A student housing project adjacent to Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.  The University is growing rapidly, with enrollment of 35,000 students in 2013 expected to grow to 40,000 students by 2018.  Project is under construction and now pre-leasing, with approximately half of the buildings scheduled for completion before August 2014.  <br>Developer is seeking equity partner to take out bridge loan and complete capital stack, which is currently contemplated as:<br> <br>Senior loan (committed)                               $21,500,000       <br>Mezzanine loan (committed)                          6,000,000<br>Investor equity                                                       5,189,000<br>Developer equity                                                  1,000,000<br>Total cost                                                             $33,689,000<br> <br>Alternatively, if partner is not comfortable with mezz structure, investor equity would need to be increased to replace it.<br> <br>Under mezz structure, stabilized NOI = $2,513,860 for yield on cost of 7.46 %.

          He needs a local bank. Here&#39;s why. We don&#39;t do take-out loans. No one will pay bridge rates for a take-out. Or is there more to the story that I&#39;m not seeing?         </p>

          I think the issue with this deal is that it is not income producing yet and even though it is student housing does not guarantee a smooth ride in leasing circles.<br><br>One of the big issues I see is that there is already a construction loan possibly in place. They would need a take out loan and I agree with Sal, the best place to get that is with a local bank. If it were me I would source who the local lender or lenders have been on other student housing deals at that University and approach them to do a take out loan and get the construction lender out of the deal.        </p>

          Sal, Fulga mentioned it that it is Class A Student Housing at a Texas University. My comment about it may not be a smooth ride in leasing circles is based up the following. North Texas University in Denton, Tx has several student housing projects that are not 100% leased and have had to use strategies where they are almost giving away the farm to gain interest.<br><br>At University of Texas Arlington, which is two miles from my home has a lot of student units that are not all leased out because the buildings are not part of the University and the University has no incentive to do anything more than add the buildings to a list of other properties and because they own properties of their own that they obviously have more incentive to market.        </p>

          Yes. That is good local, &#39;insider knowledge&quot; that we we get to during desktop due diligence. <br><br>The moral of this story applies is this: just because a strategy is successful in most or some markets, doesn&#39;t mean that it will be successful in *all* markets.         </p>

          Good morning Sal:<br>I really need your help on getting the phone calls and emails scripts for calling banks and buyers that was promised three weeks ago during our coaching session as part of doing our homework. After many requests in the Dandrew community (as per your advice), we finally received a 2-page script, but it was for calling the brokers, not the banks, nor the buyers.<br><br>I have spent a large amount of money in building a credible business so I can be a serious player in the investing community; however, almost everybody we dealt with was requesting a LOI and Proof of Funds before engaging in any business relationship with us.  <br><br>In addition to creating a Commercial Real Estate Financing Club, I’ve purchased a list of the top commercial brokers in the 22 cities where Dandrew prefers to do business and blasted emails; the response is tremendous, and I am looking forward to great deals to come in our pipeline! The big issue we’ve experienced so far is that we cannot “show our money” to prove that we are able to “walk our talk”. Please help us with this issue that was discussed during our coaching call and it was also promised by you. You may or may not remember that we were asking for $10,000 instead of $5,000 and you said that you’ll see what you could do to help, so we are still waiting. <br><br>Thank you for your understanding and support.<br>        </p>

          CMBS Loans Follow-Up<br>Sal, thank you for your fast response; greatly appreciated! I need to clarify some of our discussion points, so we are on the same page;<br><br>I did not purchase a list of CMBS loans, but a membership to an Internet Provider of ALL Troubled Assets; I can assure you would be impressed about the amount of information provided (access to $8 trillion of commercial property sales, including financing and foreclosures, search for specific property, loan or investor attributes, explore 40,000+ company profiles for the players involved in each deal and much more). <br><br>Let me clarify now my question: Is the CMBS approach the best one for controlling a multifamily complex? The training claims that CMBS loans are “the ticket for building an empire” because the CMBSs have no commercial transactional funding. One can get full control without the associated liabilities, so I assumed it’s the best and maybe the easiest way to go, but I need your expert advice on this.  If you give me the blessing, then I will put some efforts in place to achieve this business goal. If you re-direct me to another strategy, please explain which the best way to go is. <br><br>I am not sure what you meant by “What you’re doing here is mixing 2 different strategies: buying (“Capital Formation”) and funding (“Capital Placement”), but you make an excellent point because the training video talks about both under “deal structuring”, and that was exactly my confusion and question about (it did not make any sense to assume a loan when one could just buy the shares).<br><br>Going back to what I would like to do with your help is : find a “qualified CMBS loan” in my cities of interest, make an offer to the owner to purchase the shares on his company, and close the deal.  I would also want to use Dandrew’s financing if I do not have enough capital for the shares’ purchase. Your thoughts on this? Go/No Go?<br><br>Thank you again for all your time spent with me. I am truly grateful.<br>        </p>

          One of my business goals this year is securing a passive stream of income by controlling a multifamily apartment.  Going through the training materials, I concluded that the best way to accomplish this is to look at CMBS loans and buy the shares of the owner’s LLC; however, I am confused with the training video on Deal Structuring for Buying Stabilized Assumable Loans. Here are the steps from the video:<br>1.  Pre-Qualify the deal (5 points); Better if Stabilized; Debt Stack: CMBC<br>        *  Loans are assumable, but we must QUALIFY to assume a loan.<br>        *  Defeasance to consider as well, which would increase the payoff substantially<br>2.  When we find a deal we put it into a BK remote: cannot bankrupt the SPA.<br>3.  Work with an experienced attorney, not Title companies. <br>4.  Real Estate is held in a SPE (Special Purpose Entity) that is a LLC or LP<br>5.  The Seller (SPC) is a LLC that has a beneficiary, so is the buyer. The deal is structured such as the Buyer LLC (beneficiary) takes the place of the Seller LLC (beneficiary); we are switching chairs. Servicer does not know anything about the switch, so we should NOT pay 1% assumption fee. As a result, there is no commercial transactional funding…we go back door and SWITCH ownerships. We control the asset without ownership.  <br><br>Questions: Why should we go through the trouble of assuming a CMBC loan and risk failing the qualification as sponsors when we can go back door and buy the shares of the LLC and control the asset? What am I missing in the process? Were the first 1-3 steps informational only and step 4 is the one that we should really follow? If so, <br>would these be the steps?: (a) find CMBS loans, (b) qualify them, (c) submit the qualified deals to Dandrew, (d) call the owner, (e) propose a structured deal: need the script, and (f) submit the term sheet. I don’t usually run a business by feelings, however, “my gut” is telling me there is no logic in this step sequence.  Please advice.<br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>First, this is great the steps you laid out. But, let me be clear here. You purchased a list of CMBS loans that you wanted to do something with. I didn’t advise you to do that. <br><br>However, with that said,  I’ve *never* traditionally assumed a first trust debt paying the assumption fee. That is just the bank’s way of trying to extort more fees from the borrower. Banks like to charge fees for no reason whatsoever. I know this, because we do the same thing. That is why we’ve never gone through the hoops of qualifying when we’ve assumed assets. <br><br>What you’re doing here is mixing 2 different strategies: buying (“Capital Formation”) and funding (“Capital Placement”). <br><br>So your questions might seem confusing at first glance, so here is what I would do following your lettering convention for *assumable loans*. <br><br>Remember, I only want you to be successful here. So this is why I’m taking the time to right-size this for you:<br><br>a.  Find *assets that have CMBS loans*. <br>These can come from listings and, sometimes LoopNet. Some deals you can find by using the keyword search *“assumable”*<br><br>b.  *Qualify them using the 5 Data Points*. <br>If the numbers make sense, make an offer for *you* to purchase. We don’t buy anything, remember we just fund things.  <br><br>c.  Submit the *pre-*qualified deal to Dandrew *for Sal to give his opinion only on via AskDandrew*. Remember, we don’t buy anything, we fund a lot of things. And if the debt is already in place, what do you need me for? <br><br>d.   Call owner. <br><br>e.  Propose deal structure after Sal has given his opinion. <br><br>Present the deal the way Sal has told you to present this deal. <br><br>f.  Submit the *LOI* to your buyer and see if he bites. <br><br>Regarding “feelings”, I don’t know what you mean, however, I think I clarified this for you. Remember, there is only so much “autopilot” you can do in this business as it still requires some face-to-face time. Would you have decided to buy anything from me if you didn’t get to know me over a 1.5 – 2 hour webinar? No. Same here. *Commercial deal makers know how to romance…* <br><br>And lastly, the scripts I’m working on will be emailed to you directly as you are a Virtual Coaching Member. Give me about 1 hour for that. It will be worth it and I’m sorry I didn’t get them to you sooner. <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal <br>        </p>

          For the purpose of our business focus and efficiency, we need to better understand a line of the Submission Form /General question related on how would Dandrew participate in the deal: as a Purchaser or Financier.  Our question is: what type of assets is Dandrew willing to purchase? If an asset meets the stage 1 and 2 qualification points, is Dandrew willing and able to purchase the asset or there is a contingency in place (e.g. align another buyer)? <br><br>Thank you <br>        </p>

        <p>
          My questions are directly related to the 5-week live coaching calls and we need your help on clarifying topics related to our homework and its integration with the overall business strategy. <br><br>WEEK1: We briefly discussed the three bases for deals. Our homework was to find two cash institutional buyers for each of our cities of interest by using Google search. After two days of “searching REIT institutions” and making the appropriate calls, my assistant gave up because most of the info was obsolete, so it was obvious we had to change the strategy. During our first call we did not discuss the subject “Starting the marketing machine and putting your business on autopilot” we decided to define our own strategy and implement it the best that we could. We found a company that provides a detailed list of commercial real estate banks (decision makers’ info), but also a list of buyers who specialize in each deal type (multifamily, office space, student housing etc.). For us this was the answer for the topic “putting your business on autopilot”. Once we have detailed and accurate lists, we can make phone calls to develop the relationships needed. Since the SW can blast thousands of script emails to all parties, it also brings on board the “automation” side. We are also planning visits to small local banks so we can meet the decision makers on a personal level.<br><br>WEEK 2: During the entire 2nd coaching call we had the impression that we did not know what we were doing since we were critiqued as “being all over the place”; since we accomplished our homework 100% and much more, we were pretty demoralized and confused by your feedback. We also concluded that our interpretation of the “entire marketing on autopilot” was not aligned with your vision. With this in mind, please clarify what exactly the “start the marketing machine and putting your business on autopilot” is all about and what are the implementation steps. We will change our marketing strategy according to your recommendations. <br><br>Our week 2 homework was to make phone calls to small/private banks and submit deals to Dandrew. We are in the process of doing exactly so, but confused about this homework; dealing with Notes and REOs is like a stand-alone business, and we feel that we jumped to fast from one complex subject to another, without concluding the first one. <br>Is it possible to change the homework such that we find and submit deals from clients that need commercial real estate funding, so we don’t need to deal with buyers as well? Once we go over this process first, then we could handle deals that involve buyers and sellers. We have leads coming from LinkedIn, and we have a great SW provider, so this would be a logical step within the overall learning strategy. Please advise.<br><br>The last subject that needs clarification is related to all type of deals that need buyers. Since we are told to submit these deals without a buyer aligned, we assume that Dandrew’s team will look into their buyer list and try to sell the deal. Our question is what’s happening if nobody from Dandrew’s list is interested to buy?  Can we assume that we lose our commission and all the hard work with it?<br><br>Blog for 5-week Live Coaching Program: It would be great to have a blog for the program members, so we could share our work, ideas, and strategies that work and what don’t work and help one another to succeed in this complex but great business. I hope the program members would agree with me.   <br><br>Please help us with the Proof of Funds, Email and Mail scripts that were promised during the first call. We submitted the request again during the call, as you requested. <br> <br>Thank you for helping us to see the light through a huge forest. <br>        </p>

          5-Week Live Coaching Status Report as of Feb 27, 2014 <br><br>We are in the 3rd week of coaching, and after giving a serious consideration on how to set-up this complex business and run it efficiently I’ve came up with a general strategy shared below. The credibility kit helps a lot, however, there is so much more to be done and so many questions to be answered. I am learning this business as fast as I can, while implementing a strategy that makes logical sense to me.  To accomplish this we identified first all our players who request a commercial loan, those who want to sell and those who want to invest: small banks, brokers, title companies, attorneys etc. The next logical step was to identify the best SW provider that have the “ready to go” lists for all our players and capable to use the email blast feature. One step further, is be able to identify a buyer for each specific deal available for sale. Here is the additional work associated with the implementation of the marketing plan. Pease note that in the absence of a direct guidance, we were facing a lot of “trial and error”.<br><br>1.  Website: We were working on improving the website to cover the entire business. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and PPC (pay-per-click) will be implemented as soon as we have clarity on the marketing budget. <br><br>2.  Social Networking/LinkedIn: we were getting too much garbage, so our new strategy is (a) to create and manage two specific groups (one for financing and one for investing) and (b) upgrade our membership to Executive where we can use “In Mail” feature that guarantees responses. For $87/month we can send 25 email/month. Our goal is to send emails to all “Chief Credit Officers” from the banks of our choice; according to LinkedIn, they have to respond if they have the same membership. <br><br>Note: So far we received about 500 emails via LinkedIn and website: about 90% solicitations are selling leads, 2% need financing and one is a tape. We are still qualifying them. <br><br>3.  Phone calls to small banks: We compiled a small database with info for all banks in Austin, Huston, Dallas and Son Antonio with total assets smaller than $500 mil, who also have “Other Real Estate Assets” due by 90 or more days. We made about 15 calls. Since we did not get the promised script from you, we created our own as follows: “ Hi, I am Fulga Iancu, from DCP capital in NY. We are a principal buyer of commercial real estate products. I want to speak with someone in your loan sale department to see if they have any commercial real estate assets that need to be removed from the balance sheet.” We were always transferred to the “Chief Credit Officer” line, but got the voice mail, and left the same voice message, with minor exceptions. From 15 calls, we could reach one chief executive officer who was very pleasant, but unfortunately was not able to work with us due to “regulation issues”. <br><br>4.  Business/marketing on autopilot. Status: we identified the Internet SW provider with info about buyers, sellers, investors, and even more find the buyer for each type of asset. Since is very expensive, we need to work on the budget allocation first before committing to one year membership. <br><br>5.  Building relationships: Not done yet! We will make personal phone calls on a daily basis to our potential clients and keep records of the phone conversations with follow ups. The book deal is a good start, but there are great CRMs (customer relationship management) that do a pretty good job in managing the client relationships). I am fond of personal visits to regional small banks and get face to face with the decision makers. <br><br>It is obvious that implementing the marketing plan and putting the business on autopilot takes time and money. What I did so far in a short time is my personal interpretation of how to accomplish this task required by Day 1 coaching Infographics.  I am looking forward to hear your opinion on this and provide us some tips that would help us do better.<br><br>Lesson Learned and What We Need:<br>1.  Creating a Good and Efficient Marketing Plan, and putting in on autopilot is a very complex task. This subject is included in Day 1 coaching Infographics. I am looking forward to hear your opinion on this and provide us some tips that would help us do better.<br>2.  Using Google search to create the buyer list is inefficient and time consuming.<br>3.  Thomas-Law website did not work for us.<br>4.  We need the Proof of Funds that was promised during our first call and the phone/email scripts for calling the banks.<br>5.  We would appreciate your help during tomorrow’s session by your calling banks to listen to your “speech”; here is a small list that have commercial assets that are “due” more than 90 days. <br>6.  Anything else that you do not approve from what we are doing, please re-direct. Any tips that would help us to be more efficient and to do better would be greatly appreciated. <br><br><br>Bank  Location  Telephone #<br>Western Alliance Bank Phoenix, Arizona  602-389-3500<br>Plains Capital Bank Dallas,Texas  214-525-9100<br>Southwest Securities, FSB Dallas,Texas  214-859-5200<br>Texas Capital Bank, National Association  Dallas,Texas  214-932-6600<br>North Dallas Bank &amp; Trust Co.

          As a follow up of our phone call today, please advise if you are interested in a phone conference with my contact (authorized asset assignees) representing 148 banks for the purpose of liquidating the commercial assets in bulk transactions. My contact is hired by the banks to qualify purchasers for the banks&#39; assets through the liquidation process. The program is strictly confidential. The assets are highly discounted  for a quick sale. Minimum purchase is for $250 mil cash. These assets are not distressed properties, but performing. They are not offered for sale through the banks, only through the assignees who are paid by the selling banks. They can work only principal to principal. <br>This may be a great opportunity and I believe we need to act quickly. If you are interested, we could set up a conference call for Monday; if not, please let me know as soon as you can, since I am interested to talk to other principals before is too late.<br><br>Thank you and am looking forward to your  response.<br>Fulga        </p>

          <br>I’ve received the email on Friday Jan 28 regarding the 5-week coaching program, and I’ve tried to get a seat since then, but no luck; the seats have been taken! Is there any chance for me to get into the porgram now? I have the entire business set-up, hired an assistant full time, and my team is ready to roll the ball full speed…but I cannot reach anybody in Dandrew’s team, although I made several calls and left voice messages for Matt. <br><br>Any hope? <br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I apologize. Matt has been extremely busy talking to folks about this. I&#39;m not sure he isn&#39;t calling you because we&#39;ve hit the 5 or because he&#39;s just getting inundated with calls. I didn&#39;t expect this to be as popular as it has become. We didn&#39;t really market it that hard, by design. It was just to get a few more AJs trained. <br><br>I will send him a note to call you either way tonight/tomorrow. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal:<br>It took a while to set up the entire business as per your advice, but finally everything got done as follows:<br>Company name: DCP Capital, LLC (created in DE); the issue with not having a brokerage license can be solved by filling a form stating that the business does not have substantial presence in Delaware to be subject to licensing and taxation (Nexus Questionnaire), see link http://revenue.delaware.gov/information/faqs_lic.shtml <br><br>Website: www.DCPCapital.com   Main website issue: On the bottom of the Home page, InetUSA is advertising their own business, and refuse to remove statements as: “Get a website/ tell a friend/…” jeopardizing our company’s credibility. Since we are committed to running a serious business, this is not acceptable, thus it would be beneficial if someone in your department would talk to them. I hired a specialist to promote this website via SEO and PPC, and at the first look, I was told to get rid of these statements ASAP.<br><br>Email: financing@dcpcapital.com<br><br>Phone: 646-402-6686 via the Intelligent Office Assistant Service who promised to weed out deals for us.<br><br>LinkedIn:  www.linkedin.com/pub/fulga-iancu/89/6b2/3b1/   still in development <br><br>I am phasing out my current business in Short Sale, and phasing in the Commercial Financing. My primary focus is finding CMBS deals and notes in Austin, Huston, and Dallas, TX.  I am also interested in purchasing a building with 100+ apartments to secure a passive stream of income (with your help), while this business will secure an active income. I would greatly appreciate your help in detailing out how we approach the SPE owner once we get the contact number, what the script would look like? Obviously I cannot say: “Hey, I am a buyer who would like to switch the hat with you and get you out of trouble”. I can get a list of CMBS deals for $5,000/year/region. The list also provides info on all troubled assets in any desired region.<br>Thank you and look forward to working with you towards a successful business relationship. <br>Fulga<br>        </p>

          I will answer your question in two different groups only this time, to make sure you see my response.<br><br>Sal, the answer to your question is: NONE; I was good enough to stop implementing the strategies learned in DC Fawcett and Susan&#39;s seminars after asking one of my assistant to work full time for 2 months, and find out that I was looking for “the needle in the haystack”; I believe that an efficient strategy is reaching the owners, small banks&#39; asset managers, REOs asset managers etc. before the competition does!  Also, after reaching them, one needs to develop a RELATIONSHIP of trust, because the cream of the deals are being offered to “preferred customers” <br><br>So Sal...this is exactly what I try to avoid this time: working inefficiently and wasting time and money. In my experience, the marketing steps would be in this order:<br><br>1. Locate a market area / niche where you want to do your business. Focus and expertise are key in business, so I am focusing on Austin, Huston and Dallas, TX/ commercial residential 100+ units. If one tries to target everything and everywhere...may end up with nothing just frustration and pain.<br>2. Find out a good source that provides lists of distressed owners, small banks&#39; asset managers, REOs asset managers etc. in the selected area that is not publicly shared.  Don&#39;t use Loopnet and other cheap online sources, they are really a waste of time (again, thousands of people looking for one needle...). There are great sources but very expensive, as I mentioned before. <br>3. Apply the online/offline marketing that fits your budget. Recommend direct phone calls and request one-on-one meeting to introduce yourself and your business. If you have to travel to do so...is more than worth it, and money well invested!<br>Getting good deals is what makes or breaks a business, and obviously working smart is different from working hard..so Sal, back to my question: do you have a solution for Step 2, so I will not need to pay $5,000 /county just to get one good list??        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I hear you, and I’m shocked that it took you so long to come to our “congregation” here as we have a lot of the Goldrush “refugees” here.<br>I would start by using the Pyramid of Priority and the FDIC infographic calling banks and getting to the decsionmakers. <br><br>I don’t know what Susan shows you, but I do know that *the single point of failure is when you are not direct*. <br><br>There are folks who aren’t spending much money at all on marketing and I believe that this is going to be your best bet. <br><br>Let me know if you need more instruction.

          I apologies for posting my comment in different groups, but there is no way to find out if my comment was received. <br>I’ve tried to get an answer to a key question that was posted twice in “Ask the Dandrew Team” group, and then made some phone calls at 866-325-2336 to follow up, even sent my question by email…no response so far so I here we go again for the last time. I am not even sure if my comment was posted, since there is no feedback!<br><br> I am a new member who needs some basic guidance regarding the marketing strategy. I&#39;ve been listening to all modules and could not find any recommendation on where to find lists of distressed properties, so my team could use marketing strategies such as direct mail, phone call, etc. I&#39;ve listened to the success stories of the 5 students, and they shared with us their “preferred” way to reach to the owner, without making any suggestions on how to find the owner before the competition does. <br>My company specializes in short sales, and I have a strong interest in commercial properties, thus attended several seminars such as DC Fawcett Gold Commercial Properties in Dallas TX, Susan Lassiter-Lyons&#39; Commercial Mater Lease Option online course, etc. Regarding finding the deals/owners (individuals, REO banks etc), both were recommending several strategies such as online search engines (e.g. Loopnet), contacting Title companies, brokers, asset managers etc. etc; however, in my experience using these strategies, it was looking for the needle in the haystack: a very tedious, time consuming and inefficient way to find good leads before the competition does. First, one needs to find lists of asset managers, title companies, etc…<br>It would be extremely beneficial for everybody, to detail out this important step in Module 1, for the sake of efficiency, progress, and success. In a nutshell,  As an example, for those who have money, there are some pretty good sites although very expensive, that provide detail info on commercial distressed properties, REOs, auctions etc.  (Membership from $5,000/county/year-$20,000/US/year and these sites are pretty good. <br>On the other hand, it would be very beneficial to have a road map for the entire course; I don’t mean to be critical, but the information is all over the place, difficult to follow…so whoever designed the website did not have good, logical specifications. This will create many members to give up early, not because they are not good…but the training is not good….sorry for being blunt, but is for the sake of all of us, including you!<br>I have an office in Westchester County NY, and hired two assistants full time to help me succeed in this new challenge, so we are ready to go and waiting for response on efficient ways to find owners, title companies, assets managers etc <br>Thank you in advance <br>        </p>

          Hi Sal:<br>Since the LinkedIn is a main source of leads, I’ve asked an expert to design my personal and company’s page. He said that the design is similar to the Wells Fargo’s LinkedIn page that ranks #1; Please provide your feedback, it would be greatly appreciated!<br><br>First link is for my personal account, the second is for the company’s account: <br><br>http://www.linkedin.com/in/dcpcapital<br><br>http://www.linkedin.com/company/dcp-capital-llc<br><br>Thank you<br>Fulga<br>        </p>

          Fulga, <br><br>This looks great. I like it. <br><br>But what I don&#39;t like is the awkward color combination for your logo. Orange and light blues sell cars, not finance.  <br><br>1. Please find a color scheme or logo you like by Googling: &quot;Financial Logos&quot;. <br><br>2. Chose one that looks like it shouldn&#39;t belong on an Easter Card. <br><br>3. Send it on Fiverr.com for someone to create. <br><br>*4. Pay for the extra gig to get it in .AI (Adobe Illustrator) or .PSD (Adobe Photoshop) source files*. <br><br>Only because your LinkedIn profile looks like a beauty contestant, but your logo makes it, in my opinion, makes look like that same beauty contestant is smiling with some missing teeth... get my point? <br><br>Your pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          I’ve asked the HelpDesk the following question: <br>The LinkedIn Profile Critique Certificate requires to mail the Signed Certificate and ALL materials as LinkedIn Profile, Skill Sets or similar promotional material; I just don’t get it! The materials were “purchased”, all we had to do was to personalize it.<br>Should we just provide the link to my company’s LinkedIn page for Critique?<br><br>And I’ve received the following answer:<br>Your question to DandrewHelpDesk.com (below) can ONLY be answered on AskDandrew.  It&#39;s a REALLY GOOD question, that deserves an answer directly from Sal &amp; the Dandrew Deal Team, so PLEASE, ask your question on AskDandrew directly.  We can&#39;t answer questions like this here at the Dandrew Help Desk...we&#39;re just not trained for it.<br><br>Can you help? Thanks <br>Fulga        </p>

          Fulga: <br><br>Just send me your link here and I’ll critique it. You don’t have to at all of course, however, some Intermediaries like to have me put their blessing on it because they think they should or worse yet its OK to co-mingle their profile with their Acai berry juice or single family junker businesses. <br><br>But you seem to know what you’re doing.
