          Sal,<br><br>Can you give me some guidance on this project I just started working on? I am in conversation with what appears to be the developer on the project. He is working with a well-known four star flag hotel (he refers to as his client) to develop a mixed use retail destination to include two or three hotels where the main flag will be a four star, restaurants, entertainment venue, retail, etc. This project will be about 40 miles south of Anaheim. They have a second similar project that will also need funding in AZ.  <br><br>The developer said this is a $300-$450mm project in California that can break ground in six months or less. This is a world class hotel chain that wants to expand rapidly. He said they have 4-6 other sites already surveyed that the client likes with one being near downtown L.A. The developer said they are particularly interested in a group that can raise the money for a long series of hotels.<br><br>I have a fund that is interested in potentially funding this project in California. After signing the developer&#39;s NDA, I sent him the requested information that the fund wants to review regarding the project/sponsor.<br><br>Can you answer my numbered questions below regarding the steps I should take to get compensated should this deal actually fund and close? In your five minute Commercial Deal Structuring Secrets video, you said the term sheet is pre-negotiated. So, here are my questions:<br><br>1. Should I create a brokerage agreement letter outlining my fees to present to the sponsor or do I only need to negotiate my fees with the capital provider before the term sheet is written?<br><br>2. Is it asking too much to request a 1% upfront point on a deal this size? Is that a customary amount or is it less in a deal this size?<br><br>3. Should I attempt to get the upfront point and interest spread? If so, what amount for each would you say is reasonable on this deal?<br><br>I know a .25 point on a deal this size is a lot, and I don&#39;t want to appear greedy.  However, at the same time, I don&#39;t want to sell myself short.  <br><br>Please share your wisdom with me on this deal so I can hopefully make you proud.<br><br><br>Thank you.<br>Bill        </p>

          Bill: <br><br>*”...appears to be a developer.”*<br><br>If your wife or girlfriend said she appeared to be pregnant, would this sit well with you? You need to figure that part out. <br><br>Is this fund real? Did you do a check on them? Google Search? How do you know they are real? <br><br>Regarding your questions, (assuming you take the pregnancy test before going deep here) below are my questions: <br><br>1.    Negotiate the fees with the capital provider first, then before the term sheet is presented, get those same fees/incentives agreed to in writing with the Engagement Letter. If you have a fake capital provider, you will look foolish. <br><br>2.  Its going to be more of *0.25% - 0.5%* of a point probably. Larger the deals, the smaller the %, *but keep in mind that the $’s are much larger to you…*. Don’t be a greedy pig.<br><br>3.  I would avoid interest rate spread as in development deals, that is seen as being too aggressive and, well more abrasive to the developer. He has no cash flow coming in, and you want to step on his jugular. <br>*I would negotiate an equity stake in the management company for this at founder’s share prices.*. <br><br>Are you coming to the conference in January? If not, you should. That is unless you plan on being dead. If you’re not dead, you need to be in Las Vegas. This is the 2nd day stuff we’ll be discussing. Make me proud by coming to Vegas to talk about this juicy action here. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Thanks for your resonse.<br><br>&quot;...appears to be a developer.&quot; Yes I know. I should never make a statement such as &quot;appears to be, I think, sort of, kind of&quot; or otherwise that comes across as less than certain. I said that though because I knew he wasn&#39;t a broker, but at the same time, he didn&#39;t give me his position within the project. <br><br>Yes the fund is real. I know of someone else who is actively using this fund on his deals. <br><br>I attempted to signup for the January conference this past Monday. I thought we had until midnight on Monday to pay the full $997. When I went to sign up, I saw the price had doubled. I created a ticket with the HelpDesk, but no one ever followed up on it after the customary response saying &quot;your request is being assigned to a team member.&quot; I was hoping to meet you and feel like a &quot;Big Dawg&quot; for a day.<br><br>How much of an equity stake should I seek on a deal like this? <br><br>This is one project with many similar projects in the works. This is a huge hotel chain that wants to expand to other locations worldwide. (so my contact tells me)<br><br><br>Thanks.<br>Bill        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I need your help! My contact on this deal is trying to vet me before moving forward. He is not the principal/developer but more like their &quot;right-hand man.&quot; The fund manager wanted to setup a conference call for Monday. I relayed this to my contact. Instead of working to make that happen, he comes back with questions about the fund which I copied below.<br>************************************************************************************************************************<br><br>1. What are your sources of funds? (Not names, just   types, sizes.)<br>2. What is your history on large projects, say, above $100mm?<br>3. How long of a cycle are you projecting for projects such as this?<br><br>Many of these deals are going to need predevelopment dollars that usually come from HNW individuals, and they usually own a piece of the GP. <br>1. Do you have those resources? <br><br>We have similar situations in Texas, Aruba, and   Curacao. Others in the works.<br>1. Can you handle those?<br>2. Then the question becomes how large can you go? <br>************************************************************************************************************************<br><br>I shared this with the fund and they basically said they&#39;e not going to jump through hoops answering his questions when a phone call with the principals can do the same.<br><br>I relayed this to my contact and he responded with this:<br>************************************************************************************************************************<br><br>&quot;We have a call today at 4:00 with a FINRA registered Investment Banker, broker, and former developer. This is our third call, we have vetted him, and this took four days to set up. We know who he is talking to and have given him exclusives for several entities. But we know these entities from other connections. They have a market reputation, something you lack, at least to our knowledge.<br>I can’t find you on FINRA’s search, unless you are nested in the pages of “William Clark” entries. No info on Highrise, except on your own website.<br>Here, you are asking for a phone call that will take me hours and days to set up, but won’t cooperate with my needs for preliminary vetting before I can go there. This isn’t a good start.<br>We have shown you what we have (but only one project) but we know nothing except what the website tells us, and this doesn’t answer any serious questions.<br>The text below says “The fund is here.” Does this mean you are a fund or not? The text is ambiguous. If so, how much money can you put into one deal if you decide to do so. Knowing who you are talking to is important. Giving access to people you don’t really know is not something I am big on, but you can decide if you want to give me the information requested or not.&quot;<br>************************************************************************************************************************<br><br>Sal how should I respond to my contact. I know the fund does not want to invest a lot of time in the preliminary minutia if these guys are shopping around their project(s). I could use your experience and wisdom here.<br><br>Thank you.<br>Bill        </p>

          Good morning Bill.  I&#39;m new to this group and could not resist to chime in on your request of Sal to guide you with advice to handle this contact who seems to have more $100mm deals in the pipeline than any normal intermediary would see in a life time.  Reading your post gave me flashbacks to when a mortgage broker friend of mine (who is no longer a friend) tried to get me to work leads that came from a website blog called &quot;Broker Outhouse&quot;, sorry that slipped out. It was actually called &quot;Broker Outpost&quot;.   Seemed that everybody had deals flowing in from everywhere, but nobody seemed to have any sources.  The dialogue was very similar to what you are getting from this guy.  The first thing I would ask this guy is, since he has this FINRA broker who has access to what he wants, is he going to treat you the same way after you go to all the trouble to jump through his hoops!?  The one thing I hate about this business is those damned bright shiny objects ($100mm deals) that look so beautiful, and have so much promise that go nowhere and result in nothing but guilt and shame.  I start everyday with the same prayer, Lord keep me focused on the basics, I&#39;ll take the $3-5mm deals over the $100mm+ deals every day!  If I am ever blessed enough to actually have a first hand relationship with investors with that kind of horsepower, then and only then, will I get into that arena.  Hope this helps.           </p>

          Thanks Chris for taking the time to chime in! That does help. Thanks Sal for your response. You surprise me with your humor sometimes (referencing &quot;hit by a bus&quot; north of 51st)!!  I&#39;m glad to see people can have humor in this business like &quot;Broker Outhouse.&quot;<br><br>One thought that did come to my mind Sal when you said &quot;let&#39;s think through this&quot; was why is this guy even talking to me when he is on his third call with this FINRA registered Investment Banker that he has vetted and appears to have all the connections. <br><br>I see the point you both are making. I won&#39;t play into his games. I could banter back with him and tell him his questions are basically asking me how much a bag of groceries weigh without knowing what&#39;s in the bag. However, I think I&#39;ll just nip it in the bud and tell him if he doesn&#39;t get the funding he needs after shopping it around to get back with me.<br><br><br>Thanks again!!<br>Bill        </p>

          Good morning, Bill.  Isn&#39;t it obvious? There is no &quot;FINRA registered investment banker&quot;, he wants to get to your source by intimidating you with his big shot talk.          </p>

          Sal, I have a buyer looking to purchase a fix and flip (NOO) residential property and I have a private (mom &amp; pop) individual willing to fund it. The private individual is not wanting to commit to my hard money lending fund yet. She knows nothing of real estate so I will be handling the process. She wants to get her feet wet first I guess. In this scenario, how do I show up on the HUD1? Do I show up as a broker? Or do I show up as the lender and just have a note agreement with the private individual and have that note secured by the property? I am thinking it is the latter? Thanks!        </p>

          Sorry, by NOO I mean non owner occupied residential property.  I have a buyer looking for funding to purchase a house to rehab and resell. I have a private individual who has the funds to finance the transaction. The private individual will wire the funds directly to the Title company. Private individual is charging me 10% interest plus 2 points and I am charging the buyer 12% and 5 points. I am wondering how this will look on the HUD1. Seems to me there should be a note between me and the private individual collaterized by the property and the HUD1 will just list myself as the mortgagee?        </p>

          Ah! Great question: <br><br>Package your fee as a brokerage fee which is your 2 points on the 1003. <br><br>Then on there, place 15% interest rate. <br><br>Then have the the servicer pay you your 2% each month. <br><br>make sense? Its easy.<br><br>Then         </p>

          Peter, <br><br>Great question. <br><br>The *“Hope Certificates”* are negotiated prior to releasing a term sheet to the sponsor. This is your equity in the stock of the special purpose entity (“SPE”) that holds this asset. <br><br>That is written into the term sheet. Then, it is written into the Operating <br>Agreement for the SPE as owners of the holding company. <br><br>Does that make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Good morning, Nique.  Hope you don&#39;t mind my chiming in. You were asking about how to show up on the HUD1, which would indicate to me you are not a licensed real estate broker, mortgage broker or securities broker/dealer, am I correct?  All 50 states have enacted statues requiring anybody who sells real estate for another person or entity be licensed in that state. Also, since 2008 several states (13 to my knowledge) have enacted new statutes limiting who can broker commercial loans. Each state varies somewhat, but each of these states require some form of licensing. If my assumption that you are not some form of broker is correct, this is NOT bad news, it&#39;s good news!!  Offer to take the title company underwriter out to lunch and explain to him/her your situation and what you want to do. The underwriter is usually an attorney and would be intimately knowledgeable regarding state license and lending laws.  He/she may have other solutions to offer, but being legally compliant is simple. See if the underwriter knows of a broker who does similar investment deals and ask to be introduced to that broker.  Set yourself up to be the investor, not the broker.  Let your new &quot;partner&quot; be the broker, you then factor all of your fees into the deal as lender only .  If all goes well, the broker and the title company underwriter will soon be coming to you to fund deals. You grow and everybody wins!!   Keep in mind, most states have &quot;implied&quot; fiduciary obligations for real estate brokers, and if anything goes wrong with this deal (the buyer is a new investor getting her feet wet), well let&#39;s just say there are hefty fines and prison times that may be awaiting an unlicensed &quot;broker&quot;.  You don&#39;t need that! Never wear two hats in the same deal for your own protection.  Hope this helps!  Happy Investing!!        </p>

          Thanks Chris for chiming in and providing additional good info! It is structured so I am the lender on this deal and not a broker so I am ok on this deal. Thanks!        </p>
