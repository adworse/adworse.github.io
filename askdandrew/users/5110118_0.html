          Sal,<br><br>1 - Is it possible to know if those deals are leading somewhere or not? If they are leading nowhere, what were the disqualifying factors for each of them?<br>2 - Please let me know on these assumable loans what would it take to qualify a deal?  I have few pending submissions I would like to get term sheet on.<br>3 - Am I better off presenting the assumption of a CMBS loan as a Joint Venture Recapitalization with full control of the LLC the asset is in or consider a Shortsale / DPO where I am the new buyer.<br>4 - Deal Submission doesn&#39;t give us the Assumption option or scenario.  All I see is Purchase &amp; Refinance, knowing that Dandrew doesn&#39;t purchase, the CMBS loan can&#39;t get refinanced because it&#39;s underwater.<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Oumar        </p>

          Oumar: <br><br>The deals you sent over for us to assume the loan have been turned down. Why? Was it something you said? No. Of course not. Remember, Dandrew Partners doesn’t buy anything. Controlling a property by assuming a loan is not something we do. This is something more seasoned and well capitalized Intermediaries are doing. They are syndicating capital to buy assets. <br><br>To repeat: We don’t buy anything. <br><br>We’ve put together this infographic to show some Intermediaries how to do this as some are a little more advanced now and want to quietly build an empire. Some of the higher-level consulting students I’ve worked with in the past have done these and I’ve helped them along with that. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Believe me, there is no loss in translation considering French is my 1st language (I am fluent in several languages) and everyday that passes by, it&#39;s 1 day away from my rookie days and 1 day closer to becoming a Dandrew Alumni. Rosetta Stone used to be. I bought couple of their products for my kids but there are newer apps for languages on iTunes much better and way cheaper, you are better than Rosetta Store, at least you don&#39;t sound confusing.  I am looking for Intellectual Capital and opportunities...<br><br>1 - I was hoping your would be offering me a &quot;Strategic Meaningful Plan&quot; as you offered in &quot;Commercial Real Estate Financier Group&quot; because I have similar source helping owners of CMBS loans maturing, non performing, and in default...<br><br>2 - Concerning the Walgreens, you did offered assistance to a student for the purchase of such assets using the advance of 3 year lease payment of the revenue stream (7 years lease payment in your example) as downpayment, with &quot;the agreement that certain actions would take place simultaneously before title changes...&quot;<br>You are the CRE Engineer...<br><br>3 - Yes, I had a legacy issue, but I took the necessary steps for remediation, that&#39;s the reason I am 1 of your students.  Legacy issues won&#39;t impact upgrading and we are all wired differently with a common goal...<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Oumar        </p>

          Oumar: <br><br>If French is your native language, perhaps that would be a good way to raise capital from people who have cultural commonalities with you. That’s a great idea…! Sometimes I wish I spoke Mandarin. <br><br>1.  If these CMBS loans are in default, then just offer them our debt and equity products! There is nothing to assume on a loan that is in either monetary or technical (or maturity) default. <br><br>2.  Yes, but these Walgreens are trading at a low cap rate. So to make them more attractive, we’d need to bid the price down (and conversely, the cap rate will go up). I also don’t know how long the terms on the leases are (aka “*duration*”). If there is 5 years left, no deal. 20 years left? I’m interested.<br><br>3.  Legacy issues are best being left alone in the past. Lets just make money, Oumar. I’m assuming your not a poet or a mystic so we share that goal collectively…<br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I submitted a deal on Friday July 3rd on drandrewprivatelending.com instead of dandrewdeals.com.  That seems to be a MONUMENTAL mistake.  You answer went to the broker that is on OM and I didn&#39;t get the answer.  I talked to Matt just few minutes ago. I was out of your system for 6 months and I just got back on the private equiteer on Friday July 3rd, I was rushing to submit this deal.  Would you please send me your answer ASAP, I am trying to salvage the deal?<br>If there is way to salvage the deal.<br>Thank you in advance.        </p>

          Oumar<br><br>You had the broker send this out. You gave him the link. That is violating the rules of submitting deals. Why did you do this? Then you told Cole you submitted it and you didn’t. The broker did. <br><br>Who is the sponsor for this deal and what is their experience and how much equity are they bringing to the table? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          SAL,<br><br>I swear to God, I  I submitted the deal myself on Friday or Saturday.   I regained access to your system on Friday July 3rd after a 6 month absence.  I had had several browsers opened.  I had to submit the deal quickly.  I just resubmitted the deal few minutes ago by using dandrewdeals.com.<br><br>I used the wrong website by inserting all the info at dandrewprivatelending.com.  I just paid my remaining balance on Friday.  I just regain access to your platform on Friday after 6 months of absence. <br><br>Why would I give anyone my link to the broker or to anyone else?<br>How would I benefit by having some else insert the deal instead of me and having the answer going to them instead me?<br><br>If you have a way of tracking IP addresses, you will see that both submissions came from my iMac.  <br>During the conference calls,  AJ has a way to know if the caller opened the website or click on his or her last purchase.  Why don&#39;t you ask AJ to do some forensic work for you instead of accusing me of lying.<br><br>Please tell me how would I benefit from having the broker using my access information and submit the deals for me?<br><br>I just resubmitted the deal correctly and I see the difference in questions between drandrewprivalending.com and dandrewdeals.com.  I have correctly answered to your questions.<br><br>Nice welcome back to me Sal.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Oumar        </p>

          Oumar<br><br>We’re not the homecoming committee. I trust that when you’re submitting deals you know what you’re doing. What you did was instead of placing your name *and email* onto the form, you placed the brokers. Why I have no idea you did this. And no one has time do forensics or any of that nonsense. If we don’t like how you’re sending deals to us, we’ll just fire you. We do it at least 2x a month. But since you’re back, I’ll give you grace. <br><br>We only want to work with the grownups. Not the wannabe’s and desperate folks. <br><br>Second, we’re closed July 4th weekend. No one is working. No one in our office, or Wall Street. That includes Friday July 3. The NYC office doesn&#39;t work weekends. <br><br>Third, you’re deal is something I don’t know what you want me to do. Tell me in plain English, in your own words here what you want me to do? It sounds like you negotiated a deal kind of backwards for a 21 million dollar deal and you need 600,000 to lock it up? Who negotiated this? It’s a disaster the way its teed up. We don’t lend earnest money; no one does. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Thank you for clearing my name.  I don&#39;t know that broker. I never talked to that broker, never sent him an email and he never sent me an email because my partner is one talking to him. I was the person who inserted both submissions.<br><br>In plain English, I am flipping the property to a qualified developer and if you get a chance and take the time to look at my submission from yesterday, you will see that all the pieces are there for the developer to bite on it otherwise I will approach another qualified developer do so.  Yes, I would put all my life savings in this deal.  I know, you will say: &#39;Oumar. you have no life savings&quot;. My answer would be not yet...but I will.<br><br>The deal is perfectly negotiated and it is ready for the cash register because we did all the due diligence in advance.  If you can&#39;t fund what I am asking for in this deal, I will not be upset at you.  <br><br>Do me a favor: Just give a call to the broker today on my behalf and tell him you are &quot;my money man&quot; and we are trying to solve the issue.<br><br>Things will change, once I sign up for the Expert Network because I am relentless. Anticipating that you will accept my application.<br><br>Thank you for your time and thank you in advance for facilitating this deal.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Oumar<br>        </p>
