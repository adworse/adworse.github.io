          Hi,<br>I&#39;ve found a distressed senior housing property available for purchase. I&#39;m always keeping one eye open for matchmaking opportunities.<br><br>So I&#39;m more clear. The 10 basic steps for wholesaling an REO commercial property that I&#39;ve found to a niche REIT?<br>1) Contact REITs for investment criteria for matchmaking<br>2) Verify REIT will accept assignment of purchase contract or LOI / Have 2 backup REITs<br>3) Find off-market or REO commercial property<br>4) Analyze with 5 data points - zero in on offer<br>5) Write LOI at formal purchase contract (ever see an assignable LOI?)<br>6) If accepted, write purchase contract w/ 60 day close and 1% cash deposit within 10 days or find $ partner if no cash<br>7) Record affidavit of purchase contract with county?<br>8) Present deal to REIT for initial underwriting<br>9) Assign purchase contract to REIT for fee (1-2% of deal)<br>10) Invoice escrow for fee to be wired at closing<br><br>Thoughts from anybody who has done this on commercial?<br>        </p>

          Yes. That is correct. I would also ask the REITs first how they like to do these deals too. Since they are the buyers. Right?         </p>

          And does it have to be an off-market property? Meaning I see some properties that are listed with brokers but the broker is just lazy and not marketing the property correctly. If purchased at a low basis and the numbers make sense, can we still cross them to a REIT? There is no loss of credibility if it is a listed property as long as the deal makes sense correct? Thanks!        </p>

          Nique<br><br>You hit the nail on the head. As you astutely stated, the brokers listing these are lazy. “Off market” means nothing today. Which is why we put together the Institutional Intelligence to get to banks directly. <br><br>And it is all about the *basis* at acquisition. Meaning, if it is a good value (using the 5 Data Points) then you can cross it. You’ll need to lock it up under K (“contract”) first. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal, In your experience, have you seen mortgage REITs divest of their non-accrual notes in the same manner as banks? In my search for LP secondaries, I&#39;ve run across shares of REITs being sold on the secondary market.<br><br>While researching some of the REITs and looking into their SEC reports, I notice maturity defaults, non-accrual, write-offs and devalued assets on their books. I&#39;m thinking the CFO may be the best person to target at some of these entities for an intro email or call?        </p>

          Hi Sal and AJ,<br>FYI -- I posted a couple of pools of Michigan NPN and REO (under $1m) on the Silver site in case someone has an appetite for that stuff. It&#39;s not for us, but I&#39;ve seen on the tapes and at the conference a few members who don&#39;t mind Michigan. <br><br>It takes a bit to get stuff posted over there because of Dave&#39;s busy schedule. If anyone besides Dave is approving comments over at the Silver site, I&#39;d love to see if we could get these assets available before the holiday for our Silver members to look at if possible. Thanks!! Mark from LA        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I have a distressed note come across my desk. It&#39;s a motel in pretty bad shape, in Panama City, FL.. The sponsor is in BK -- The note is available, but the Motel looks very undesirable. I mentioned there may be a possibility to offer the sponsor a DIP loan if the restructuring plan looked good and it included plans to rehabilitate this motel. I have financials from the note holder, but only up to 2013.. Something we might be interested in pursuing on the note or DIP side?        </p>

          Hi Sal and crew..Regarding the Freddie Mac REO posted on the Silver site..Is it possible to post a few more details on the portfolio at the Silver Site? Are we direct to the seller or working through one of the master brokers etc.. I put the word out and have a few buyers that have seen this tape over the last couple of days. One actually made bids on a $22m portion, but were told some assets in certain states were sold already and not available. Would love to make sure we have a refreshed tape if some assets aren&#39;t available.. Thanks -- great conversation starter in any event..Lots of people licking their chops on this one..        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I have two tapes ready to submit from a hard money lender looking to divest:<br>#1<br>ILLINOIS - 42 NPN, Perf/Re-Perf, REO - Mostly MultiFamily 2-4unit<br>Total UPB: $5,682,000<br>AVG Total Value: $197,944<br>AVG UPB: $195,931<br>AVG Coupon: 12%<br>Loan Type: I/O<br>LTV: 65% and below<br>Pricing: 50% of BPO<br>Carve outs: yes<br>Legal: Various states of foreclosure filed. with some DIL&#39;s negotiated<br>Pricing seems high on this. Heat map shows levels at 47% on resi NPN pools in IL. There are a few properties in not so desirable areas.<br><br>#2<br>MULTISTATE - 36 NPN, REO - Commercial, Mixed Use, MF and SFR <br>Total UPB: $17,845,920<br>AVG Value: $1,353,114<br>AVG UPB: $686,382<br>AVG Coupon: 12%<br>Loan Type: I/O<br>AVG LTV: 52%<br>Pricing: 50% of BPO<br>Carve outs: yes if majority of states are purchased.<br>Legal: various states of foreclosure filed.<br>There may be some interesting notes to carve out on this one.<br><br>Issue for me on these is pricing. From my view, since the LTVs are 65% and under, asking 50% of bpo on interest only hard money loans is pretty much asking for par, right?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>In my marketing, I&#39;ve come across 2 distressed notes for sale that may fit our axe released in the text blasts.  The banks are using auctions, through a loan sale advisor to dispose of them. I have a CA signed and access to all the collateral in the file vault. Before submitting, I wanted make sure that we bid on this type of sale.<br><br>** NOTE #1 - 144 room Independent (Not Flagged) Hotel - beachfront on the east coast. This is a 1st position DIP loan from a Chapter 11 in 2012.<br>-- As is Appraisal = $28mm - 3/5/15<br>-- Proforma from appraisal = $30mm (based on 2017 stabilsation)<br>-- UPB = $24mm<br>-- Pricing expectations: 78% of appraisal<br>-- Coupon = 5%<br>-- Default rate = 24%<br>-- Current maturity date = 6/2015<br>-- There is a PG from both sponsors<br>-- Currently in final stage of foreclosure. Has been in receivership &amp; about to go REO: Deed in escrow and per seller the title is within weeks of being cleaned.<br>-- Taxes current<br>-- Servicing-Released<br><br>-- INDICATIVE BID Due: 5p EST on 4/15/2015 <br><br>Thoughts: Bad operator that knew nothing about hotels and wanted out. Have walked away from the property. The play would be to get the asset and from the sellers POV they feel they will get close to retail. Minuses for me are that it&#39;s not flagged and the area seems VERY seasonal, with winters more than likely being very slow.<br><br>I don&#39;t have a tape on this, only an offering memorandum and can submit on that if needed.<br><br>** NOTE #2 - Portfolio sale comprised of three (3) total loans of mixed commercial assets. I have a CA with seller and access to collateral.<br>-- Assets:<br>        Loan1= Community Shopping Center - East coast state - NNN tenants<br>        Loan2= Office Blg Eastern state<br>        Loan3= (8 properties))Mixed-use, retail, office and MF - some NNN tenants - East coast states<br>-- Total UPB = $32.6mm<br>         Loan1= $13.73mm<br>         Loan2= $6.88mm<br>         Loan3= $11.98mm<br>-- CARVE OUTS on loans OK<br>-- Seller pretty vague on pricing. Wouldn&#39;t give generic pricing on entire portfolio as there are carve-outs and mixed assets. Said they expect to take a hit based on individual asset locations, values and legal status. <br>-- Coupon:<br>        Loan1= 6.41%<br>        Loan2= 6.18%<br>        Loan3= 5.97%<br>-- Maturity date:<br>        Loan1= 11/11/16<br>        Loan2= 11/11/16<br>        Loan3= 5/8/17<br>-- Legal status: All assets are in receivership and default in various stages.<br>-- BEST AND FINAL BID BY 4/23/15 - Closing by 4/30/15<br><br>Thoughts: Short fuse!! I haven&#39;t had a chance to check collateral for values or run NOI etc.. as I wanted to see if I&#39;m able to submit first and not waste my time. I&#39;ll have more info when I submit to Deals@..I have an xls tape to submit with this.<br><br>Sorry for the long post guys. Hopefully, if anything, my analysis will help others...Thanks for considering Sal!!        </p>

          Just to be clear so I don&#39;t make the mistake and keep looking at crap.. We should stay away from asset managers or servicers (like FCI) who sell commercial notes or REO using an online marketplace on their website. Even if it&#39;s a straight call for offers or auction format.        </p>

          Hi Sal, <br>Regarding that gas station note. I have a buyer about to place an indicative bid. I&#39;m wondering as we dive a little deeper into due diligence if, in your experience, banks normally have updated financials for their borrowers. I feel like I watched a video or heard an audio to not ask our bank contacts for operating statements..that the borrower will have that info.<br><br>I&#39;m thinking I will have a mandate with the borrower to get that info when a purchase agreement is signed and we go into collateral examination and I didn&#39;t want to poke too deeply with the bank at this early stage on issues they might not have answers on.        </p>

          Mark<br><br>I&#39;m not sure about updated financials. That is something that may or may not happen. Don&#39;t ask for anything that your buyer doesn&#39;t ask for. That will poison the bid. <br><br>These deals are based on collateral (loan docs) and the asset (gas station). <br><br>Leave the poking to others. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi sal,<br><br>I was watching the added continuing ed with Peter and Corey about Bulk REO managing broker expectations.<br><br>There was a great qualifier that Peter used where he would ask potential sellers &quot;What is your execution, procedure and timeline?&quot;<br><br>I&#39;ve never heard of that question before. May I ask what sorts of answers we would look for if we are dealing direct or with a broker who is direct?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Just an observation today. I was talking to a small bank who had about $5.5m - $6m in REO, non-accrual and charge off last quarter. Of course, licking my lips, I got in contact and started talking with the president about their balance sheet. <br><br>At first he was very dismissive saying &quot;We&#39;re not interested in selling!&quot; and &quot;We&#39;ve been around since 1922 and have NEVER had to sell a loan!&quot; etc... after a bit, I offered to close his file outright and he softened a little. I told him that &quot;we just see indicators in the call reports and offer to help banks, that&#39;s all.&quot;<br><br>Turns out, they were hard hit after a natural disaster rocked their region and they are still recovering. I don&#39;t know how they are fixing their loans (their reports look baaad!) but he did mention they are sitting on a pile of cash. So maybe they are just funneling money into loss reserves to keep the regulators off their backs? He did mention they had a big, 3-year lawsuit that&#39;s pending and that he thinks they&#39;ll win.<br><br>Lot&#39;s of &quot;weathering the storm&quot; and &quot;fighting through&quot; language from this guy. I received another message from a VP who just said &quot;We don&#39;t sell loans!&quot; So it&#39;s a pride/culture thing with this bank.<br><br>By the end, I had managed to create a great contact with this bank president, who tried to blow me off at first, but by the end we created some great rapport. <br><br>This was the third email contact over about  1 1/2 months.         </p>

          Hello Sal,<br>I just received a tape from a small bank of a performing note secured by 5 multi family properties consisting of 24 units total. 3@ 4 units and 2@ 6 units<br>These are in Rockford, Il.<br>Originated in 12/2013<br>Maturity is 12/1/2015<br>UPB is at $851k - <br>Pricing expectations are at about 82% or $700k for the note. <br>Appraisal $877k - summer 2014<br>Last payment 02/01/2015<br>Next payment 03/01/15<br><br>Issues I see:<br>--Note maturity and balloon on 12/1/15! I&#39;ve asked my contact at the bank why they are selling rather than wait for the balloon. I haven&#39;t heard back yet, but I have a feeling the bank has lost confidence in owners being able to refinance (see below) and avoid a maturity default.<br>--Operators are husband wife investors. Low fico scores in the high 500s - refinancing in the above timeframe and at their scores may be out.<br>--Rockford, Il market is still currently depressed a bit<br>--Overleveraged<br><br>Pros:<br>--Bank can settle this at $700k without committee approval. Any bids below that may be possible but would have to be approved.<br>--If bought at the right price, there may be an opportunity to provide longer term financing?<br>--Operators have other MF properties which may be cross collateralized in the above scenario.<br><br>Is this something we&#39;d look at as a note purchase? Or pass to one of my mom and pop buyers?        </p>

          Just received another tape of investor rental properties in GA owned by one company. I have two questions:<br>1) Do we even look at these, or should I put out to the mom and pops in my book?<br>2) About valuation. They pegged their pricing expectations on the NOI at about a 12 Cap. There are no BPO or AVM numbers available on the tape. Is income approach the way we bid on these investor rental (income producing) property pools or do I normally need to pull AVMs for each, if values are missing, before submitting?<br><br>Also, let me know if I should start asking these questions over in Silver        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>In my marketing, I came across a commercial note for sale from a special servicer on a class A shopping center in foreclosure. This is iin a Tier 2 MSA about 25 miles south of a major east coast city. Here&#39;s some of the details:<br>UPB - $39,055,919.00<br>ARV (Terminal Value): I don&#39;t know yet. I have all the collateral and am working out a value tonight.<br>Last payment: 6/1/2014 <br>Note Origination Date: June 7, 2007<br>Interest Rate: 5.99% (through 7/1/2013 then 30 yr fix) <br>Maturity Date: 10 year - Matures 7/1/2017<br>Terms: Cash  <br>Legal Initiated: Foreclosure- Lis pendens 9/19/2014 - went into receivership 12/5/2014<br>Occupancy: 92%<br>Tenant mix: Gap, Jos Bank, AnnTaylor, Banana Republic<br><br>Country music song:<br>Originated in 2007 to refinance interim construction<br>debt and recapture a portion of the equity, the Loan was<br>transferred for special servicing as an imminent default<br>in March 2014 due to the Borrower’s written claim that<br>several major tenants with kick-out clauses in their<br>leases had shown weak sales, raising the possibility of<br>their vacating by the fourth quarter of 2014. As of January 2015 no BK has been filed by Sponsor or guarantors.<br><br>Offers due Wed 2/18/2015<br>Closing on or about 3/11/2015<br><br>I haven&#39;t talked to the broker yet on pricing expectations but will contact them tomorrow. Is this something worth getting into?        </p>

          Yes sir. I&#39;ve gotten some updates to the above:<br>** Current Value = $24.2m (per current est. NOI @ 10 cap) This cdisclosureould be way off and is based on their <br>** ARV (Terminal Value) = about $26m (about 9700 sq ft available to lease)<br><br>**Seller pricing expectations: mid to upper $20m<br><br>Some pros that I see:<br>-  Class A property in what seems to be good condition - fairly well leased up<br>-  In foreclosure, some immediate hard costs minimized or removed<br>-  Great Hwy access of interstate 9<br>-  Population within 5mi <br><br>Some cons that I see:<br>- Seller&#39;s pricing expectations seem a bit high - Since they have been unable to get a trailing12 for 2014, expenses are based on 2013 numbers<br>- Looks like this property will need a qualified sponsor as it&#39;s in receivership with the courts.<br>- One of the best credit anchors, Banana Republic will be out of the property in Jan 2016<br>- There may be some further tenant migration over the next two years.<br>- Not much of a value play unless note can be secured with a deeper discount        </p>

          Yes. This is a small pool from an asset manager contact. The tape has a mix of NPN, REO and re-performing. I&#39;m looking at it because there&#39;s a couple of notes that fit the trading desk alert, but there are some under $60,000. We can carve out. Should I submit on the whole tape?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;m hooking up a servicing company to look at their assets they or their clients have for sale. They want me to fill out a buyer&#39;s package with info on my company, buying requirements etc. This is the first one I&#39;ve filled out, so they ask about which servicing company I use or if we service our loans ourselves. Did I read somewhere in the forums that we use Evergreen in WA or FCI? Do they ask because they look to hold the servicing rights for themselves at settlement? <br><br>Also, I&#39;m saying that we are a Broker and Private Equity when they ask what type of note buyer we are?        </p>

          Mark<br><br>This is a great strategy. Ask them *before* you fill it out do they sell servicing-retained or servicing-released? Just so you can amend your bid accordingly. You’re a principal bid. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          New question: Just got the phone with a bank who is sending over a tape of assets. A couple of banks have been mentioning something about &quot;Classified Assets&quot; and &quot;Classified Asset Ratio&quot; can you give me some color on this as it seems these are assets that the banks are working on disposing or working out that I&#39;m not seeing in their Call Reports. At least that&#39;s my sense of it.        </p>

          Ahh Makes sense thanks..so I could potentially look towards their Charge Off items over the quarters as an indicator that they use that process to mark down assets before they dispose of them..and maybe even prioritize some of the things I think are more right than others to sell. <br>        </p>

          Hi Sal, had an LP secondary acquisition deal come across my desk. The seller is an investment group that is under contract with an LP investor, who is going through a personal Ch. 11 BK and is divesting his 40% interest in a 26 asset portfolio of NNN Walgreens valued at about $133m. <br><br>The LP investor&#39;s 40% interest represents about $35m in equity. The seller&#39;s group has the LP shares under contract to purchase at about $.43 on the dollar or $15m purchase price. The investment group is willing to sell their entire position or a partial amount.<br><br>A little more info on the Walgreens:<br>** All are located in the midwest.<br>** 16 of the 26 stores are under 10+ year leases.<br>** Walgreens has expressed interest in extending the short term leases of the other 10 stores.<br>** Portfolio is levered to about 31% or $42m in senior debt.<br>** Portfolio equity total is $91m<br>** The remaining 60% equity holders are developers who build Walgreens stores.<br><br>I haven&#39;t approached them about possibly funding this deal, as it came across as a straight acquisition offering. <br><br>Are we looking at LP secondaries to purchase at this point? Is Dave looking at these types of assets?        </p>

          Yes I agree. This is only a scenario that came to me from an associate that is getting into the business. I&#39;m papering up with these guys and setting a conference call to get a tape and more color on the deal.<br><br>I had the same initial reaction to the Walgreens/Rite Aid merger and I will definitely ask that pointed question regarding the possible dark stores.<br><br>From what I&#39;m reading, Walgreens will need to shed off some stores to make this work, about 500 in their estimation but those store have to be sold to legitimate buyers at competitive pricing and can&#39;t be a firesale or straight closures to avoid reg. scrutiny. <br><br>I&#39;ll post with an update once I get deeper on this.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I had a call with the co-founder today. The buyers are a large purchaser of these LP secondaries in the small balance and lower middle market space of $100k - $20m. Their marketing is out there, so you may have heard of them. They purchase and hold long term in their portfolio or divest according to the investment horizon of some of their capital partners which range from retail and HNWIs as well as some family offices and institutional investors. They emphasized that if this deal didn&#39;t work, they had others.<br><br>They are still in due diligence, having received all the collateral from the distressed LP investor, and are now working getting the 23 or so existing mortgages from their respective lenders. They are due to close within 60 days.<br><br>** Stores are clicking off Same Store Sales between $2.5 and $3m<br>** Buyer is projecting a 33.87% IRR<br>** BUT.....The loans on the properties are self-liquidating (&amp; why the leverage is so low), which I believe means the investors are dumping everything back in to rapid amortization.<br><br>To the point of the dark stores. They could give no certainty, as there isn&#39;t a list of closing stores at this point. Based on their DD and research with other retail NNN players, they are moving ahead based on the confidence that the states that their stores are in, with the exception of Michigan do not have a Rite Aid presence. <br><br>They are anticipating that Walgreens will shed those stores that would be self cannibalizing if the merger went through and there were a presence of both a rite aid and Walgreens in the same area. Based on some of the research I&#39;ve seen, Walgreen&#39;s has a higher sales per square foot than Rite Aid and many are thinking that the Rite Aid stores would be first to go.<br><br>They laid out a couple of ways to participate:<br><br>1) Keep buying company in place, with a 5% acquisition fee - investor brings up to $15m on a 9-12% pref with 50/50 split<br><br>2) Purchase their entire position of $15m, paying a 5% acquisition fee and possibly leaving a couple of stores to the buyer as a profit sweetener.<br><br>They are open to other structures as well, including partial purchase of cherry picked assets.<br><br>I have a tear sheet available.. I told them I was running this up the flagpole to my investment committee. They would be available for another conference call if any principals want to move forward and look deeper.<br><br>Let me know if this is something you or Dave would like to look deeper into and I&#39;ll submit the tear-sheet and the info above.. Then maybe I can setup a conf. call if you&#39;d like. Thanks!        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Through one of my contacts, I had a office deal come across my desk, in downtown CBD of a large city in MN. The sponsor, a privately held REIT, is looking for a $14m preferred equity or mezzanine infusion to pay for the TI/LCs on an incoming credit tenant. That new tenant has signed a lease to occupy 141,000 sq. ft (21.5% of total) in 2016. <br><br>Current NOI is $3,256,550<br>ProForma NOI is  $5,063,699  (1 yr - Non-GAAP adj w/ incoming credit tenant rents)<br><br>Current occupancy is around 70% and will jump to about 82% at when credit tenant moves-in Aug 2016.<br><br>The cap stack currently consists of a $32m senior debt and a $3m pref equity piece, both placed at acquisition in 2014.<br><br>Exit at this point is to stabilize and refinance at 3-5 yrs. <br><br>I&#39;m waiting for official bios and track record of the REIT from the sponsor who is highly qualified and has much experience locally and in the asset class. Meanwhile, I&#39;ve gathered a bit of info from press clippings and SEC info. Some of the hair on this deal may involve the REIT&#39;s founder being ill and the company recapitalizing of some of their many holdings in MN to consolidate and raise cash.<br><br>Another option floated by the sponsor is to refinance completely out of the existing senior and pref into new, longer term senior debt and a $14m pref piece. This is their 2nd choice as there will be some interest reserves that need to be capitalized, as well as the possibility of the property running at a deficit until it moves toward stabilization with the incoming credit tenant&#39;s rents.<br><br>Is this something Dandrew would like to look at deeper?<br><br>Thanks for taking a look..        </p>

          Hi Sal or AJ,<br><br>I had a $9m refinance into a 12 mo. bridge loan come across my desk. This is a 220-unit MF in Springfield, IL. Sponsors are well qualified and liquid. I have all the 5 data points and it&#39;s ready to submit but, this may be outside of Dandrew&#39;s parameters, as the sponsors are looking for a rate under 7%.. <br><br>Is the Reinsurance Co program only for stabilized perm debt?        </p>

          I&#39;ll let Sal say more on the Reinsurance Co program in future days, when he is back to answering questions on AskDandrew.<br><br>But, generally speaking this kind of stabilized debt a qualified sponsor should have no problem getting from a traditional institutional lender.<br><br>Now, if there turns out to be hair on the deal, that&#39;s when we would be glad to discuss.<br><br>My recommendation is to put it on ice and check on the sponsor in 30 days or so to follow up, and see what happens.  Usually waiting in silence and then following up reveals more of the story.  I&#39;ve seen it happen before.<br><br>Let us know what happens here, Mark.  Good questions!<br><br>-AJ        </p>

          Yes, I actually had a couple of outside programs able to do this but I had trouble getting the broker who referred the deal out of the way. <br><br>I try very hard to be direct to the sponsor, so I&#39;ve passed on it without getting too involved.<br><br>Thanks AJ!        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I have a contact that has a fractional interest in a MF property for sale. Is Dandrew still looking at these for the OFREE fund? If so, what other types of info beyond the 5-data points should I collect?        </p>

          Mark, this is AJ, responding for Sal while he is out of the office.<br><br>As far as I know, OFREE is not taking on any new fractional interests, but it is an interesting scenario.<br><br>If you&#39;re willing to do an &quot;exploratory&quot; deal review on this with AJ, and if that can wait until at least Feb 18 or later, I&#39;d like to discuss it.<br><br>Now, I don&#39;t want to get your hopes up, because chances are it will just be a learning experience for both of us, and likely go no further, just because of the nature of it.  However, if you find that worth your time, I think it would build to our training base.<br><br>What are your thoughts on this?<br><br>Thanks for the question, Mark.<br><br>-AJ        </p>

          Bill, <br><br>Good question.  It needs to be a rural community somewhere in the midwest, not larger than 15k people in population, where the story has been the sole broadline retailer (general goods &amp; pharmacy) for more than a decade, and where the nearest competitive broadline retailer (like a Walmart, Target, etc) is more than a 40 minute drive away.<br><br>Also, cost basis is key.  We target 9-11 % cap rates on the transactions, with over 5 years left on the lease.  Extensions don&#39;t count.  If there is less, the cap must be higher, and I must have confidence that I can strong-arm the tenant into renewal &quot;the AJ way&quot;.<br><br>It&#39;s a tall order, but that&#39;s how we think.  That&#39;s what works well.<br><br>Do you have anything that is in this ballpark?<br><br>-AJ        </p>

          If these are represented by a broker, would you like us to try and get an option or tie up the property? Or just Tee it up like normal with data points etc...on a referral basis?        </p>

          Stu, I really shouldn&#39;t do this, but I just happened on this question while Sal is out of the office.<br><br>I checked, and I see that you&#39;ve been a member of AskDandrew Silver for at least a year, great!  And you&#39;re asking questions for Dave over there, also great.<br><br>The call you&#39;re asking about is on the Conference Calls with Dave Gordon tab:  Ask Dave call on 02-18-2015<br>http://silver.kajabi.com/posts/ask-dave-call-on-02-18-2015<br><br>Only current ADSilver members, such as yourself, can access this.<br><br>There are a lot of other calls in there that you could benefit from, so I suggest that you find others and listen to those too.  It will make you significantly smarter than you already are.<br><br>Keep it up, Stu...<br><br>-AJ        </p>

          Hi Sal,  <br><br>Medical Office bldg in Grand Forks, North Dakota came across my desk for a refi into a 12 mo bridge loan. Qualified buyer, qualified deal. Is this something Dandrew would consider?         </p>

          I&#39;m aware of North Dakota&#39;s shakiness because of the Bakken Fields. I believe there are other economic buffers in eastern ND, specifically Grand Forks and Fargo, besides oil. Namely Amazon, healthcare and the military. <br><br>I&#39;m looking at this at a different angle as well because, this is a 12mo bridge where the anchor credit tenant is owned by a $9b health company, the existing NNN leases are guaranteed and in place through 2033 and the sponsor, in particular, has a fairly high net worth with plenty of commercial properties that he owns in the area..        </p>

          Hey everyone,<br><br>Sal, I know we don&#39;t do anything with Assisted Living, but I wanted to reach out to my fellow intermediaries on this. I got a call from a community bank holding a 73-unit independent living facility as REO in Johnson City, TN outside of Knoxville. Currently running about a 35% Occupancy. If anybody has an appetite for this type of deal and drop me a line. I&#39;ll have more info on the 5-data points in a bit.        </p>

          Here&#39;s a testimonial: Dandrew Answering Service.. Some of the best money I&#39;m spending while getting business ramped up. My receptionist is very pleasant, has a great greeting tone and represents my business well. And it&#39;s affordable. I don&#39;t know if they are doing any Dandrew oriented scripts or what not at this point, but I get compliments on the voice and initial contact point of my company...including the on-hold muzak..Im sure ill miss the service as I grow and can afford an office receptionist. If you&#39;re just starting out. Get it. Even if you&#39;re struggling to keep the lights on..keep that number active.. Good luck!!        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Through my marketing I&#39;ve received a request for $14.3m pref equity for the purchase of a 348-Unit Class-A Multi-family building in Dallas, Texas built in 2015. <br><br>This property is an off-market purchase direct from the developer. Sponsors are an experienced real estate acquisition firm with a strong track record and are very experienced in this type and size of investment. They have been working in the Dallas market for quite some time.  <br><br>Exit is to finish leasing up from 44% to 94% occ and sell within 5 years. Zero (0) CapEx at purchase. I have bios and track record available along with 5 data points, etc..<br><br>Is this something we can look into as a Dandrew deal?        </p>

          Hi Sal, <br><br>I have a bridge loan come across my desk. This is a value-add play on three office buildings in the bay area of Northern California, where the seller has completely mismanaged the properties and they&#39;ve been basically vacant for the past 2-3 years. Financials from seller are minimal and the properties aren&#39;t throwing off any NOI. Sponsor is a former architect and developer looking to renovate, stabilize and sell properties in 24-36 mos.<br><br>We won&#39;t do a blanket loans, so I need to put together 5 data points on each property separately, correct?        </p>

        <p>
          Hi Sal, AJ and Team, happy weekend..<br><br>Given that we can&#39;t control what crosses our desks.. Here&#39;s something that came through this morning. It involves a development project, but as noted in your previous post, there could be elements in it that may hold an opportunity. I wanted to post here and get a public &quot;No&quot;, rather than a private shaming if I submitted straight to the deal desk.<br><br>This is for a 24-month bridge loan for $8m at 26% LTV against entire project estimated by sponsor at $31m in value. This is a loan to refinance out of the current bridge debt, which is facing a maturity default. <br><br>Sponsor is well qualified and has a track record as a developer &amp; investor throughout Southern California.<br><br>The project is a 28.2 ac. shovel ready, residential for sale, ground up luxury town-home/SFR community development on the North Shore of Big Bear Lake, CA. Plans consist of 10 waterfront homes, 110 Townhouses, A retail/clubhouse and 175 boat slip Marina. <br><br>Final approvals are in place &amp; the lots are FULLY ENTITLED. Off-site improvements are bonded and completed. Roads and utilities are running to the lots.<br><br>Current NOI: N/A — development deal<br><br>ProForma NOI/Project Net Cash Flow: $47,000,000 (excluding financing costs)<br><br>Current Cap Stack:<br>1st TD Bridge Loan:   $3,600,000<br>Junior Lien:            $1,550,000<br>Junior Lien:            $600,000<br>Total:                               $5,750,000<br><br>Sources:<br>New Senior Bridge Loan     $8,000,000<br><br>Uses:<br>Payoff Current Debt            $5,750,000<br>Const./Lender Reserve    $1,002,000<br>Interest Reserve 10%     $800,000<br>Costs and Fees       $448,000<br>Total                $8,000,000<br><br>Exit Plan: <br>Sell off ten (10) finished lakefront lots for a gross revenue of $12,398,000 (35% Gross Profit Margin) within 12 - 18mos to pay off our bridge loan. Sponsor has pre-sold one (1) lot for $1.1m with a $40k deposit. Sponsor also plans to build spec houses on two (2) of the lots, within the first 6 months of closing for retail sale within the 1st year. <br><br>This is will be a gated community and there are no available waterfront lots like this on Big Bear Lake. Sponsor feels that this is an edge with wealthy people looking to build on the lakefront.<br><br>Narrative: <br>Sponsor purchased the 28-acre property and has been operating &amp; developing it since 1981. Sponsor and equity partners have invested around $22m to date. There have been starts and stops over the years, including plans with Marriott to turn into a timeshare community.<br><br>11 townhouse units have been pre-sold at $750k - $900k. Deposits have been taken, but the project White Report needs to be issued (see below) before going to contract.<br><br>*** The current hair on the deal, is pending litigation between Sponsor &amp; San Bernardino County vs. an environmental group, which is due to be resolved in the 1st week of December. The lawsuit has to do with a small plan revision made to the development and involved title insurance issues on the 10 finished lots. <br><br>Because of this issue, the Sponsor has the choice to indemnify the title company for the 10 residential lots NOW, or wait for the issue to be cleared up in court. The backup plan, if the case doesn’t go in the Sponsor’s direction, is for him to indemnify the title company and move forward with the sale of the 10 lots. If we decided we wanted to fund before the first week in December, Sponsor would indemnify title as well.<br><br>Once the issue is cleared, White Report can be issued and construction on the townhouse phases can begin construction.<br><br>Sponsor is very bullish on the Big Bear Lake market right now, with Mammoth Mountain&#39;s recent purchase of Bear Mountain and Snow Summit resorts for $38m and their planned revitalization/development of the village area of Big Bear Lake city.<br><br>NOTE: They don&#39;t want me to try and broker this beyond Dandrew, so if this is a complete pass by us..I will drop it.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>Are we still only looking at broken development deals and NOT ground up development? <br><br>I had a condo development &quot;ground-up&quot; come across my desk this morning, looking for about $25m in debt. Sponsor has experience, cash equity and presold inventory. <br><br>Trying to find a place for this...maybe a local bank?        </p>

          24% or $8.5m against a $35m project cost -- They are a PERE fund and this project is spread over two of their funds. One that is closing out and another $22m fund they are still raising capital on. Additional sources of capital for the project are 5% in presales.<br><br>Land is purchased. Entitlements in place. About 3-4 weeks away from final construction permits being issued and breaking ground. This is being built in the Durham CBD.<br><br>They&#39;ve had a few term sheets issued at this point, but what hadn&#39;t fallen in place is the cost of capital and that they are looking for non-recourse options.        </p>

          Just to give an update on this deal.. I received a couple of offers on this (one offer from a contact that another Dandrew intermediary brought) and another from an larger, old school NY intermediary/advisory firm who not only is looking at this deal, but wants to help possible develop this sponsor and guide them towards more institutional money for their deals in the target market. We will see what the sponsor bites on this week..<br><br>But better news, talking about that advisory firm (Ackman-Ziff), I&#39;m glad that this project and my handling of it was able to help open the door with these guys. I&#39;ve been able to start a relationship with a team over there, that hopefully, will widen my network to more quality players. These guys arrange financing for large institutional investors and deal in projects with a minimum of $30-50m.. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to do that if I couldn&#39;t talk intelligently enough for them to feel I was marginally credible. <br><br>This is a Dandrew result..It may be a long term result, as I&#39;m just hitting the one year mark working on the commercial side, but the foundation is deepening and I&#39;m out there doing it..Just a matter of time now for something nice to close. <br><br>So thanks Sal, AJ and Team...  Onward!        </p>

          Hi Sal and team,<br><br>Question..outside of SBA 504 loans..have you seen many commercial capital providers offer &quot;debentures&quot;? I&#39;m still trying to understand the concept..but it looks like they are a type of bond?<br><br>I had a foreign development company approach with a request of JV equity or Debentures for a development deal.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Are you interested in seeing any deals that Dave Lindahl is attached to? I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;ve seen an old video, or something, that you know who he is and potentially have access to his deals.<br><br>I have a couple of Multifamily deals with Lindahl attached, that are looking for equity. Their marketing looks to be setup for retail investors and it doesn&#39;t look like they have money..Because of that, I&#39;m inclined to pass on these outright, but wanted to verify the Lindahl thing before going further with them.        </p>

          MRios - I&#39;ve had many years experience with the Lindahl community and Lindahl deals. The problem isn&#39;t that Lindahl deals are &quot;bad.&quot; or that any deal is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good.&quot; Lindahl-style deals are not ideal for the Dandrew method of financing. Let me try to explain: The Lindahl community does one thing really well. They take individual retail &quot;investors&quot; and teach them how to get into multi-family. I personally purchased more than one multi-family deal using the technique. They teach students to go after Core stabilized product, eliminate as many risk variables as possible, and try to get themselves into position to control cash flowing assets that act like ATM machines - putting money into pockets on monthly. They don&#39;t teach much about financing &amp; stick to regular banks to get the job done. Crude, but effective for beginners. <br><br>Core stabilized product is best financed with lower interest rate traditional bank financing. These are not a good fit for bridge lending or aggressive equity. Lindahl students would pay too much. Dandrew would not be competitive in this space. Why pay 12-15% standard bridge lending rates when someone can get 5-6% loans form a bank?<br><br>The calibre of the typical Lindahl person is &quot;student.&quot; While I know a few who have substantial deal books, most don&#39;t. They might be able to handle simple stabilized &quot;momentum plays&quot; or lipstick-like &quot;value plays,&quot; but getting a complex repositioning done would be a challenge. <br><br>A deal that came through a Dandrew desk requires more experience. Perhaps more importantly, Dandrew capital providers would require more management experience. Lindahl students have a huge obstacle to overcome to get the kind of experience on their teams. <br><br>The Lindahl community deals primarily in retail money (on the equity side) and traditional bank money on the debt side - think mortgage broker. Dandrew community deals have more hair on them, require a more sophisticated investor (both on the debt and equity sides), and look more like strong value add and opportunistic type deals. <br>Lindahl deal can be good for the right investor. Think low risk, low reward, core or core-plus types. <br><br>That said, Dandrew does teach how to be successful at these types of deals if that&#39;s your thing. There are institutional investors out there who like stabilized product - or who have allotments in their portfolios set aside for this type of product. Lindahl students are taught to use banks and doctor / dentists. What if you could find new sources of capital (like an insurance company and/or family office) that needs some stabilized product in their portfolio? Might you be able to bring capital to Lindahl students that behaves more efficiently than traditional bank finance or doctor/dentist money? What if you could start a small fund that invests in stabilized product in the equity space and joined forces with an institution that likes debt in stabilized multi-family product? <br><br>For the occasional Lindahl student that actually has a deal book worth looking at (there are a few, but very few), you might be able to structure a credit facility and take a retainer, a fee, and maybe even parts of the deals they use the credit facility for. Getting a Lindahl student to the closing table faster adds value to that community &amp; you would get paid accordingly. <br><br>Make sense?         </p>

          I&#39;d also say, what sticks out to me that&#39;s undesirable,is that Lindahl is a big guru, so I don&#39;t see him managing the day to day on these deals, which leaves us with the inexperienced and no money sponsor handling business. Not really a situation I want to put my name behind.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;m seeing a lot of Multi-Family deals come across my desk where the property is occupancy and rent stabilized, but sponsor is looking to put CapEx in after acquisition to say, refinish parking lot or upgrade kitchen counters etc..<br><br>Would these be examples of a sponsor making a &quot;market bet&quot; that doing those improvements will allow them to charge rent/upgrade premiums?  <br><br>Also, a few of these deals I&#39;ve seen are looking for equity behind proposed FNMA or Freddie Mac financing. Doing internal unit renovations mean that either units will need to come offline to do the renovations.<br><br>Do those agency programs typically allow for a sponsor to risk mucking around with the stabilized occupancy to do improvements like that? Or, if there are significant improvements that the sponsor wants to do, they&#39;ll need to find bridge financing to restabilize the property during the renovation/occupancy volatility.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>Through my marketing, I&#39;ve received an inquiry from a portfolio lender, who has signed a flow commitment to sell performing loans to a hedge fund. Fund will be buying about 75% of portfolio lender&#39;s production. Residential only with mix of OO, NOO and Investment properties. They&#39;d be originating the loans, seasoning 30-60 days and selling to the fund about $2-4m each month. <br><br>He says most warehouse lenders won&#39;t give a line in order to sell to hedge funds. He reached out to see if we had a credit line or warehouse type of product that could help them support and originate the production on their flow agreement with the hedge funds. Lender feels that a line of about $5-8m would be sufficient to cover their needs. He also says they are capitalized plenty well, but that capital is a bit too expensive for this type of production. <br><br>Is this a scenario that our fund, or even the reinsurance company would look at? <br><br>Also, among other things, is one of the big differences between a credit facility and warehouse line, the amount of sponsor discretion?        </p>

          Mark Rios from LA: <br><br>Boy do I wish you were with us at the Expert Network in Miami where Dave Gordon told us all about this business. You got the invite but never cashed in the winning lottery ticket… Jeez. <br><br>Anyway, the warehouse line is for origination. Meaning, if they underwrite a loan and it is underwritten incorrectly, the end buyer won’t buy it and it will stay on the warehouse line. Not good. So there is *no* discretion when it comes to Warehouse lines and Credit Facilities. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Yes, believe me, I would&#39;ve loved to have been out there for sure, but for various reasons I haven&#39;t been able to take advantage of that opportunity yet.<br><br>Thanks for the insight on the discretion question.

          Sorry..another question connected to my previous:<br><br>Just so I can talk intelligently on this. Is there usually a HUD1 on residential note pool purchases?

          It&#39;s a fairly simple transaction, $1.5m small balance pool of notes that I&#39;m crossing. I know that when doing loans my company ends up on the HUD statement..But I wanted to verify if that&#39;s the case for note pool transactions.        </p>

          Not really. Depends. Did you ask them what their convention was for closing these deals? I mean, they have experience, right Mark? Or will you learn the hard way that you didn&#39;t qualify your seller. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi sal,<br><br>I have a small note pool I crossed, with an accepted indicative bid and is going into due diligence today. I have fee agreement with the broker that brought me the tape  to get them out of the way and my buyer direct. <br><br>I have an email agreement for my fee, but what type of formal agreement should I lock in place with my buyer to get my fee? Engagement letter or submit an invoice when they go to escrow?        </p>

          Carlos, <br><br>I would use a different fee agreement for that. I would place your question on AskDandrew Silver as that is a great question for Dave. What your seller is doing is selling this paper off on a “flow basis” and you should definitely ask Dave for that agreement. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Carlos,<br>You definitely should bring it over to the Silver site. I talked to Dave on the phone about this (or a similar flow deal from another MH seller) about 3 weeks back.<br><br>If you indeed have a buyer, I am direct to the seller on this flow deal. I also just received a tape of $5.8m of MH performers from their conventional tranche, that we could trade as a representative deal before setting up a flow scenario, if your buyer wants. Drop me a msg if you want to explore.        </p>

          Good morning Sal and Dandrew nation...I think I have something for a small deal structuring clinic before the Labor day holiday..<br><br>Here’s a deal that’s come across my desk. On the surface it looks like a straight MF syndication deal. <br><br>Too small for Dandrew, newer investor and outside of our MSAs. However this sponsor may be putting me on a $10k retainer to help him raise some syndicated money for this project.<br><br>I need some outside eyes, if you have time, to see what some of the CapStack options are.<br><br>60 Unit multifamily located in a suburb of a southern state, Tier2 MSA <br><br>* Current NOI is roughly 160,000<br><br>* Proforma NOI - 250,000 with 90% occupancy<br><br>* Current Occupancy - 60%<br><br>* Sources - Senior Seller Held Note: $2.5m - Syndicated Equity: $435k <br>* Uses - Purchase $2.8m - Closing, loan and hard costs $135k<br><br>* Current Debt Stack - Free and Clear<br><br>* Exit Plan, Key Events and Narrative - The owner is willing to carry 90% of the note back or carry a second on the project. Seller needs at least $280k in cash for medical and other necessities. The occupancy is so low due to the health of the owners and not being able to pay attention to the property.<br><br>The project comes with an extra 5 acres that can be developed into an additional 60 apartments. Once the property is at full capacity and the additional units built, it is going to be more desirable to larger investors.<br><br>Exit plan is to refinance all investors and seller after stabilization in 3 years..Pull cash out and reinvest cash in the development of the extra 60 units - sell to Insurance Co or institutional investor at 5 yrs. <br><br>-- Sponsor is local to the area, knows the market very well and holds a few MF properties of slightly smaller size out there. He&#39;s also syndicated small amounts ($50k - $150k) on previous deals so he&#39;s familiar with the process. Wants to start managing more money to prepare himself for his first acquisition fund in 3-5 years.<br><br>* My notes: I pointed out that buyer is overpaying on this asset at a 5.7% cap, where avgs in the area are at 7.5% - 9%. Buyer is looking at this because of the favorable terms he is getting from the seller. Seller entirely flexible on terms and willing to structure something that gets them their cash and helps rehab the property from an interested investor.<br><br>I’d like to find a way to not syndicate so much money, as well as not put so much of the risk on an ailing seller if possible - I was thinking of this type of stack: <br><br>1) Smaller (30%-50%) senior note from a lender <br>2) Junior debt piece, equity piece or blended position for the seller <br>3) Smaller, syndicated amount from group investors. <br><br>Thought is to use the cash from the lender to pay seller what they need and a bit more..That may placate them to accepting hope certificates on the junior side. Use the syndicated equity to pay costs and any deferred maint CapEx needed in the transition.<br><br>Any ideas on this?        </p>

          For REO, it&#39;s where Sal says..For loans, scroll down to the &quot;Past Due and Nonaccrual Assets&quot;<br><br>Look for:<br>1-4 family residential properties (closed end SFR secured by 1st liens)<br>Multifamily (5 or more) residential properties<br>Nonfarm, nonresidential properties (commercial owner occ and non-owner occ)<br><br>I stay away from the Commercial and Industrial loans as those are &quot;C&amp;I&quot; loans NOT secured by real estate.<br>        </p>

          Thanks for that closure on the old deal. I&#39;ll update them.<br><br>On the new deal, there are assets located in Phoenix, AZ and some of the immediate suburbs. There&#39;s a mixed bag of asset types, but I&#39;ve seen about 10 assets that I thought had some potential: <br><br>** Five commercial notes on retail and office in Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler and Avondale AZ<br>** One commercial note pool on four (4) units in office condo center in Peoria AZ<br>** One commercial note on an industrial building in Glendale AZ<br>** One commercial REO on a shopping center pad in Mesa AZ (there may also be a retail structure on separate pad included)<br>** One commercial REO for an office bldg. in Phoenix, AZ<br>** One commercial REO for an office condo conversion that has multiple units in Phoenix AZ<br><br>A narrative on this: <br>The pdf they sent me has basic info with address, type and APN etc. In June, I had been talking to the regional SVP about NNN financing and he referred me to their internal asset manager, in case I wanted to buy some of their criticized assets. I put them on ice for a bit and just this week went back through my files to close up loose ends in my deal book.<br><br>These may be better with a small balance one-off note investor I work with, but I wanted to check in with Dandrew to see about this whole pdf thing, before trying to get a focused tape that includes more info on my choices.        </p>

          Good afternoon Sal,<br><br>Here&#39;s something that might be interesting...I&#39;m in direct contact with one of the biggest originators of FHA and GNMA guaranteed MH loans in the country. They contacted me looking for a monthly flow buyer of their product. Dave Gordon has one investor that purchases these assets, so I&#39;m checking with him on that end to see if he&#39;s interested in a flow type situation on these.<br><br>Since it seems on the surface they are looking to re-capitalize by selling off their loans in the private secondary market, the other angle I was looking at with these guys would be to propose some sort of rediscount facility on their collateral if they are indeed looking to lever their existing assets. <br><br>I haven&#39;t mentioned it to them yet and I would, ONLY IF that&#39;s something we would consider setting up a facility on. I wanted to post up here to see what you thought.        </p>

          Another thought I had was if this doesn&#39;t pass muster with Dave, would be to try and cross these performers to small banks and credit unions..if so, I would qualify them like I would a REIT -- maybe target the CCO or CFO to talk to?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Happy 4th weekend! This is a general question about these SBLCs (standby letter of credit) I&#39;m seeing pop up everywhere. I&#39;ve seen people offer this for business financing, real estate and even film financing.<br><br>I have to admit, when I see the acronym SBLC in somebody&#39;s profile, lending program or criteria, I automatically disregard it as a scam of some sort. Probably because I don&#39;t fully understand it from our perspective as commercial real estate capital providers (and budding investment bankers!).. Also, because I&#39;m not used to seeing people ask for one to put a large sum in a deposit account as collateral..sounds like a &quot;419&quot; to me. <br><br>Do you have a moment to briefly give more color on how these SLBCs are possibly used in commercial real estate and why they seem shady?<br>        </p>

        <p>
          Good morning Sal,<br>I have a small multifamily loan I am brokering out to another lender and try to close a quick deal. It&#39;s at $1m, in Hawaii and too small for Dandrew. We are going to term sheet and had a question about the engagement letter sequence and locking the sponsor to me.  This is a small tester deal for all of us in anticipation for two more deals above $4m in the pipeline.<br>.<br>Is this how it looks?<br>-- Sponsor submits rent rolls, OS, purchase agreement, etc.. for term sheet from lender<br>-- Lender says they are ready to issue term sheet<br>-- I have Sponsor sign engagement letter with my 1% fee stipulated in the debt section of the Dandrew engagement letter<br>-- I let lender know I will be receiving 1% from sponsor and send signed engagement letter to them. I can also ask if lender will pay a YSP as well<br>-- Lender issues term sheet with my 1% as broker fee (or other category they use) <br>-- Sponsor signs term sheet and we move to full application and DD<br><br>Do I have this timing right?<br><br>Thanks!<br>Mark<br>PS- that last JV Equity submission was a rookie mistake and a result of me rushing to get it submitted yesterday. My apologies.        </p>

          Mark<br><br>You were invited to the Expert Network. Did you sign up yet? Don’t let me down Mark Rios from Los Angeles…<br><br>Here’s why. You’re going to make a big freakin’ mistake: <br>*” I let lender know I will be receiving 1% from sponsor and send signed engagement letter to them. I can also ask if lender will pay a YSP as well.”*<br><br>*No.* This is categorically wrong. Your 1% comes out of the loan proceeds. Otherwise you’re sponsor is going to come out of pocket. Does he know he is coming out of pocket? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          We haven&#39;t gotten to that point yet. Sponsor just knows 1-2 points will be paid at this stage. Thanks for pointing that out and again, that&#39;s why I ask!!        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>Looking for a little market intelligence. This is another property I&#39;m looking as a possible cross to a REIT..Found a new build, flagged, extended stay hotel in Midland Tx being sold at a 22.5% CAP -- Developer built and brought it on line in 2014 and looking to sell.. Occupancy is at 67.5%, which may be a result of the market instability of the location. <br><br>I know we are down on Houston in the South east..So, I&#39;m also thinking Midland? Oil country and not so stable...Any thoughts?<br><br><br>        </p>

          No. You&#39;ll look like a fool if you try to shop this crap of a deal. <br><br>You need to strengthen your deal flow so you&#39;re not digging for clams... <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I had an older gentleman contact me regarding DIP funding. This is a failed Hotel development in Chicago, in Wrigleyville, around the corner from Wrigley Stadium. I initially passed on this as it was WAY to short of a fuse. They wanted a term sheet by the end of this week. But they asked me to reconsider as they felt they had 10 days to get financing in place. I still think it&#39;s a pass, but am posting here for the learning experience.<br><br>-- CURRENT NOI: $0 (partially built hotel awaiting completion - $8.5m value per sponsor court docs)<br>-- PROFORMA NOI: $3,505,460 (after 42 key - 3 yr stabilization)<br>-- CAP STACK: $6,500,000 senior debt (in foreclosure and BK 11)<br>-- SOURCES: $13.5m total -- $9.5m senior debt and mezzanine  / $4m cash equity from sponsor<br>-- USES: $13.5m total -- $8m acquisition / $1.8m Ground floor renovation (PHASE I) / $3.7m finish 21 room renovations (PHASE I)<br>-- EXIT: Finish renovations, stabilize and refinance in 3 yrs -- Project to be completed in 2 phases. PHASE I to complete the ground floor &amp; restaurant renovations within 90-120days, then the 21 room renovations to bring hotel online 10 -12 mos. PHASE II includes and additional 21 room construction on adjoining lot -- to be financed separately 18-20mos<br><br>-- COUNTRY MUSIC SONG: This is a textbook case that could be part of our learning here at DM...This is the wealthy father of the failed developer who sunk about $7m cash into this deal to try and save his son&#39;s ass prior to the bank calling the loan due. The NPN was sold to a distressed debt buyer who foreclosed. Sponsor filed BK as an 11th-hour, Hail Mary to save property. There are all kinds of mechanics liens and delinquent taxes wrapped up in the BK as well.<br><br>Oh....and The son also hired himself as the General Contractor on the project without daddy&#39;s knowledge. The father and his team (without the son) are the backup bid in a bankruptcy case. He has a Hotel turnaround specialist ready to manage and operate for the next three years, a new GC for the construction and his business partner will be managing the project.<br><br>The court ordered the auction of the property and a buyer was found at $8m, had financing and the sale was approved by the court on 6/15. The father was advised by his lawyer to try and get financing locked as the backup bid, because the new buyer was short $1m on the financing of the acquisition. They filed an emergency stay on the sale and contacted us. I have copies of the court docs and the term sheet for the approved buyer.<br><br>Like I said, I&#39;m not planning to submit this as a deal, but definitely look forward to your comments Sal..<br><br>Mark Rios form LA<br><br>PS: Is Dandrew or Dave still looking at that note pool I sent over on Fri? I haven&#39;t heard.<br>        </p>

          Yes, that pool is done thanks Sal appreciate it! <br><br>I&#39;m not very confident in this deal....something doesn&#39;t smell right and so far they haven&#39;t answered my question as to why they couldn&#39;t get a term sheet back in May during the auction.<br><br>So I&#39;m passing on it..        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I have another NPN note investor company that feels they are in a position to take advantage of either a JV Equity facility or to lever their existing re-performing notes with a credit facility. These are both in anticipation of them putting together their first small fund.<br><br>Currently, they JV partner through their network on a deal by deal basis, paying a 15% pref to their investors who are mom and pop retail investors. They have too many JV investors and want to start looking into institutional money to manage their investors more efficiently.<br><br>This company purchases small balance ($20,000 - $100,000 upb) pools of notes and has a specialty background in loss mitigation &amp; debt collections. They season their re-performing notes and sell to their network of retail note investors with 6-12 mos. They make $$ on loan mod pmts and profit from the sale.<br><br>-- Cumulative UPB of notes since 01/14 = $4,225,000<br>-- Cumulative Value of all assets purchased since 01/14 = $2,850,000<br>-- Total Aquisition price of all pools since 01/14 = $1,200,000<br><br>They are averaging an acquisition basis of 42% of BPO and 28% of UPB<br><br>Company has a pipeline of about $3,000,000 over the next 3-6 mos and needs an equity partner to take those down OR they have direct access to assets over $3,000,000+ for a single purchase if needed.<br><br>They also have a pool of 10 REO and NPN in Chicago under contract for $850k that they are looking for a JV equity partner on.<br><br>I am working on them for my pitch deck ala carte service as well..<br><br>I have a deal sheet, bios and exec summary ready for submission and review<br><br>Thanks!        </p>

          Hi Sal, Good afternoon.  <br>This question is pertaining to me.  I came across a strong deal source of on average $2million dollars a month in hard money loans.  These loans are being sold at par with 10 - 12% interest.  How can I monetize this, basically just working the phones and  flipping paper. <br>I had a change of heart in my first monetization model (raising money to buy and hold the loans at a spread).  Is there another way to make money since I&#39;m having difficulty raising capital?  The raising money part is really giving me problems.  Please advise -Hurol        </p>

          Hurol: <br><br>I would just flip the paper. 1% to you, so that means this would have to be sold not at par but 99%. <br><br>The value to the investor is that you know the paper and that its seasoned, etc. <br><br>But who’s going to pay you? Perhaps a *retail* investor would pay you “par-plus”.<br><br>We’re rolling out a database soon of hard money lenders who are retail and would buy this stuff all day long. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hurol<br><br>You are confusing yourself and me! Here are the steps for you to follow: <br><br>1.  Identify people who have made hard money private loans in the past. <br><br>2.  Pitch them your offerings. Tell them – in so many words – that you add value by making sure these notes are seasoned and the borrowers have strong finances. *Of course, make sure this is the case or you lose your credibility immediately*. <br><br>3.  Tell them the pricing. <br><br>4.  Sell to them in part of whole (Fractional mortgages or “whole loans”) <br><br>5.  Rinse, wash, &amp; repeat. <br><br>Note: *later* this summer, AJ will be releasing a database for you guys of real live humans who have made private loans. Don’t call me, we’ll call you when its ready. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>So my LinkedIn article about hypothecations was a hit.. I&#39;m getting some leads cross my desk, most are completely unqualified, but one scenario came across that I want to check with you on.<br><br>These are a very experienced commercial note acquisition company here in SoCal. They have a solid long time source of debt that provides 70% at about 4% on their note or REO purchases. They have been syndicating the equity portion of their deals from HNIs. They have a pipeline of commercial notes lined up and ready to take down with a very rough equity position of $22m.<br><br>I let them know that we fund on deals like these in the senior debt position of the stack because of the risk. That providing an equity facility or even as a one off note purchase may be a bit outside of our parameters for non-performing note funding. Is there a situation where we can provide equity on offs or a facility for their note pool purchases?<br><br>I have a conference call setup next week with all of the principals of the company as a meet and greet and to get started with their bios &amp; previous deal sheet        </p>

          Mr. Mark Rios, Ladies and Gentlemen!!!<br><br>Here’s what I want to see. And you have to pay attention here as these HNIs are people who are not sophisticated investors, so they give their money investing in the person, *thinking that they are investing in a deal*. So these may be seen as some hard questions. <br><br>Here’s what you want to get on an Excel Spreadsheet: <br><br>1.  Asset Address<br>2.  Type of Asset<br>3.  Basis at Buy<br>4.  Basis when Sold <br>5.  Date When Sold <br>6.  IRR<br><br>This will tell us if this guy knows what he is doing. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I have a project come across my desk from a broker contact in one of my LinkedIn groups. This is a Las Vegas developer.<br>1) Buyer to acquire .76 ac property zoned C-2 (#3-4 on infographic) on the Las Vegas Strip (at downtown gateway) for $4.5m. <br>2) Seller has secured about 60% of entitlements including approvals for 50 story condo project<br>2) Buyer to finish remaining 40% entitlements and rezone to H1 hospitality w/ special use permits for about $1.75m.<br>3) Sell approved raw land (#5 on infographic) to a condo developer for $10.8m.<br><br>Sponsor wants $4.5m in equity -- offering 70/30 split on net profits (no preferred return??) - 72% LTC<br><br>CURRENT NOI = Vacant and boarded shopping center, not currently throwing off income<br>PROFORMA NOI = Unknown - Comps avg price per acre $7,169,522 (with structures)<br>CURRENT DEBT STACK =  Unknown (current 1st trust deed $1.2m in 2008)<br>SOURCES:<br>$4,500,000 Preferred Equity partner<br>$1,745,000 Sponsor Contribution<br>$6,245,000 Total<br>USES:<br>$4,500,000 Acquisition cost<br>$1,125,000 Entitlements, rezoning and architectural fees<br>   $620,000 Marketing Costs<br>$6,245,000 Total<br>EXIT:<br>Sell raw land w/ entitlements in 20-24 mos. Target sale price $10,800,000 - weighted IRR at 28.6% (I know we can&#39;t eat IRR) <br><br>Thoughts:<br>Key event is to finish entitlements on time. What happens if they don&#39;t? They don&#39;t seem to have a backup plan and since the property is boarded up, there doesn&#39;t seem to be an interim use to provide cash flow on this.<br><br>Developer is very experienced in acquiring and developing land for this purpose in Las Vegas. Developer is also aligned with a very experienced gaming architect and government relations companies with track record of approved projects on the Vegas Strip.<br><br>This is my first land deal I&#39;ve come across so I wanted to run by you to make sure I&#39;m looking at the right things. I read somewhere that we are looking more for velocity and projects that get us paid quicker..but since this is in your neighborhood I wanted to see if it&#39;s something we&#39;d look into funding.<br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;m putting together a linkedin post/article on how to purchase note pools using a bridge/hard money lenders. If we were to fund a note pool purchase and use a collateral or absolute assignment, what sort of basis would the sponsor need to secure the notes and is there a possibility for them to buy at 100% LTC? <br><br>For example a $2,500,000 UPB in Florida<br>Total BPO value $5,000,000<br>Heat map shows 65%<br>Seller bidding at 62% of UPB or $1,550,000<br><br>I&#39;m thinking 62% isn&#39;t a low enough basis and that they&#39;d need to buy at around 40-50% of UPB or make up the LTC difference in cash?<br><br>And with the absolute assignment is the collateral held in under an escrow agreement until payoff or is it just like an auto loan where the pink slip is held by and in the lender&#39;s name?        </p>

          As long as the basis is low, the deal can work at 100%. <br><br>Also, we hold the collateral. Like an auto loan although I&#39;ve never had an auto loan. So I think I know what you mean. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, was going to ask you this in Las Vegas.  Isn&#39;t an absolute assignment or collateral assignment the same thing as getting a loan assignment...the loan assigned to the note buyer?        </p>

          I had a potential inquiry come across my desk regarding an office to condo conversion in downtown Dayton, Ohio. The property being acquired is an office building that was a bank REO. I am waiting on 5 data points, bios, deal sheet etc so it&#39;s not ready for submission yet.<br><br>Some thoughts came up though while I&#39;m waiting. From what I&#39;ve read, office to condo conversions are helping some developers move empty office buildings that have been stuck in the sluggish leasing market.<br><br>Question - Does the type of original structure type matter when analyzing the proforma NOI on condos? <br><br>I&#39;m guessing we analyze proforma NOI as if the finished condo project is an apartment building with rental income. But converting from industrial, office or MF has no effect on how we come up with the proforma NOI? And we still analyze the current NOI based on the original asset type.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I had a broker cross my desk with who has a few off-market hotel deals available. One set of which is a portfolio of six flagged hotels in a major US city that the developer is looking to divest its holdings and sell. I know were aren&#39;t buying anything, so I may look to play matchmaker here and reach out to REIT and institutional funds who have these types of hotels in their investment strategy. <br><br>Question: when approaching with a scenario, how to protect my position without getting stuck in scarcity mode and losing credibility in the process? I feel like getting NDA&#39;s signed and all that is putting the cart before the horse.. Is it simply a matter of making sure they protect brokers at the outset and doing my best to hook them up directly while adding as much value as I can?        </p>

          Ah, Mark. The age-old sucker move. <br><br>*Off-market* is a universal term for bullshit. Meaning, before you call a REIT and before you do anything to start a mess, you need to verify, verify &amp; verify. <br><br>Here is your punchlist of items you need to find out: <br><br>1.  Search the web to see if they are really “off-market”. That’s a sales ploy. I bet they’ve been shopped before as this sounds like it was something another I’mary asked me about not too long ago. *Don’t ever rely* what brokers tell you. <br><br>2.  You told me they’re “off market”. But what is the *value*? *Sal’s Rule: You need to prove value over price. Always.* <br><br>Let me give you an example: an ounce of gold is going for $1,200 right now. But have a piece in my pocket that’s off market I’m going to sell you for $1,195. Is that a deal? Where’s the value? <br><br>3.  Once you determine and promise to yourself that you’re not easily influenced by a broker using the age old “pocket-listing” BS, and you actually start asking the hard questions, then you can start thinking about reaching out to REITs and QIBs. <br><br>Let me be clear, these buyers expect you to do all of the brain damage first. Right now, you’re doing nothing more than asking for sex as the condition of a first date. Inappropriate at best, creepy at worst. <br><br>Don&#39;t be creepy, Mark. <br><br>*Where did you find this broker from?* <br><br>Sal        </p>

          haha yes.. Thanks..I am definitely doing all my normal work to vet these and will not spend any of my relational capital with potential buyers on these until I know what&#39;s up. <br><br>That said, here&#39;s what I&#39;m into on your punch list:<br><br>1) In the process of doing this and gathering any property data available through google, my nationwide MLS, and dataquick access. <br>2) I&#39;m waiting for the exec summaries and some financials on these to get started on valuating.<br>3) Haven&#39;t started dialing, but am pulling my list of REIT/QIB targets that have their criteria in this asset type and putting them in my spreadsheet database.<br><br>Thanks for the heads up, on them potentially being shopped. Broker found on a commercial RE connector website (sort of like Connected Investors) so these are definitely out there in that respect. Would it be wise to email you the list to verify if you&#39;ve seen before?<br><br>As a side note, this situation sounds like a perfect situation for the Institutional scripts but Vegas is where the money going right now...Lock Vegas down, then the scripts..<br>        </p>

          Ah! So that’s where all this crap comes from! Connected Investors. Nothing good will come from those residential sites. They are all wanna-be’s who are scared and desperate to make a big deal. <br><br>Don’t email me this. It’s a waste of time. Call banks and get direct. <br><br>I just put out a whole ‘Institutional Intelligence: Sales Desk Scripts” *for the specific reason that you wouldn’t get seduced by this crap*. <br><br>Get the scripts, Mark. <br><br>And when valuing a deal, you mentioned everything in #1 and #2 above that you *shouldn’t* be doing. Where are the 5 Data Points? <br><br>Still your pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          NO no, it&#39;s a site setup like CI but for commercial deals.  -- CI is wack! I DON&#39;T use them and this guy was NOT found there.. Realconnex.com -- Now this guy could still be BS but I don&#39;t use that CI site..found out very quick that it sucks.<br><br>Like I said, this one isn&#39;t ready for primetime yet, so 5 data points for me will come when I get the financials and deal details...<br><br>I wasn&#39;t planning on submitting this at all..I was looking into matchmaking with a REIT or QIB and my question was on making sure I get paid!        </p>

          Hi Sal, on the Bridge Lending parameter sheet we start at 6% - I&#39;ve been telling people &quot;we are a low teens player for our bridge loan product and I&#39;m able to broker some off-book bank programs for a fee in the 6-9% range.&quot;<br><br>My info may be from older videos though, and our rates may have come down since video production..What levels are we most competitive nowadays on the bridge product so I can start adjusting my quotes, or is what I&#39;m currently saying sound good?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I&#39;m in contact with a developer S. Florida in need of equity pieces on two development deals he&#39;s working on. <br><br>#1 is a 6-unit oceanfront luxury townhouse development in Boca Raton -  Total cost $28m, needs 25% ($7m) in equity - including an initial $500k for refundable deposit. Estimated returns 21% with an 18-24 mo. investment horizon on this one. More details on the Exec Summary.<br><br>#2 is a 7-unit condo development in Miami Beach near the busy Lincoln Railroad Mall area. - Total Cost $11.5m, needs $3m in equity -  Estimated returns of 47% with 18-24 mos investment horizon. See Exec summary.<br><br>Both deals look like he&#39;ll need to close on some presales as a key event to moving forward. I have exec summary and bio for the developer. Waiting on a deal sheet / track record spreadsheet.<br><br>Would these be something we&#39;d be interested in participating on the equity side?        </p>

          This is a general market question. Being new to commercial, I&#39;m trying to understand how these market cycles work and where investors may look to place their attention.<br><br>I&#39;m seeing the bleak outlook in the commercial space for Houston, San Antonio and in some asset classes, Louisiana because of the falling prices of petrochemical. I was always taught that there&#39;s opportunity in all cycles. I&#39;m wondering, if it&#39;s bad, where would be the opportunity there?<br><br>Employment looks to be down in Houston in particular. Some reports show 16,000 new apartment units built there (up to 21,000 in 2015) in anticipation of job explosion that doesn&#39;t seem to be happening.  <br><br>Some source think that the Office, Industrial and retail all are anticipated to underperform in the Houston area as well this coming year.<br><br>Is this a situation where an enterprising investor could look to attack the bottom trough of the market and buy low...or is it too volatile?<br><br>And if it&#39;s too volatile for us to lend on, what types of capital would be attracted to those distressed markets?        </p>

          Hi sal, I have a non-accrual commercial note come in from a small bank out here in Northern Calfornia, outside of Sacramento. This is a Shell flagged gas station with convenience store. <br>UPB = $561k<br>Coupon 7.75%<br>Sponsor recourse loan<br>50% Ltv<br>Appraised in 2012 at $1,090,000.00<br>26,000 sqft lot, 1600 sq ft store w/ 2 pumps<br>Next pmt 5/10/2015<br>Maturity 5/5/2016<br><br>This is a performing note, but non-accrual because the property was rehabbed and re-flagged to Shell in 2013. It was experiencing negative cash flow, but note is being paid on time.<br><br>Getting sold values on this is difficult as there is wide valuation mix:<br>Within 1 mi. - 30k sq ft 76 station w/ 1650 sq ft store, 8 pumps and car wash - sold 11/2014 at $8mm<br>Within 10 mi - 37k sq ft 76 station w/ kiosk and car wash - sold 02/2015 at $2.6mm<br><br>Listed stations:<br>Within 5mi - 23k sq ft Shell station w/ store at $1.5mm<br>Within 5mi - 23k sq ft Valero station w/ store at $1.3mm (min bid at foreclosure auction)<br><br>I am waiting on pricing expectations and some historical financial numbers to try and get a better valuation. Because of that it&#39;s not ready for primetime, and while I was waiting for that info, I wanted to see if Dandrew or Dave would be interested in this before submitting. I do have a couple of small balance commercial buyers in my book I can go to.<br><br>Other than that I&#39;d love to hear thoughts or ideas on this one..        </p>

          Hi there, While waiting for the FDIC reports to hit, I&#39;m putting together my 30k in 30 program to get some cash flowing. I am having my VA put together a contaxt list of publicly traded REITs and their acquisition criteria. I know there are some institutional  buyer qualifying questions in the commercial manual. Are there any specific buyer-book building scripts available that might help me speak cool as a cucumber to these REITs that I&#39;ll be calling?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>Can you help with an explanation on &quot;Roll-ups&quot; and how they might play into our financing DIP deals? As far as I can tell, roll-ups have to do with a prepetition lender offering further financing to the DIP, but on condition that their prepetition liens are paid off during the postpetition phase. <br><br>Have rolled up DIP deals been common in your experience and/or have you seen prepetition lenders trying to force the DIP using a capital infusion from Dandrew to also include a roll-up in order to pay off their prepetition liens?        </p>

          This is a great question Mark. Give me the context that you&#39;re talking about here. Is this real estate related? <br><br>Like most terms, &quot;roll-ups&quot; mean different things to different people. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Yes, real estate related. I&#39;m doing a little research for a credibility article on DIP financing and came across that term. I got to thinking how we, as a DIP creditor, would get super-priority status with the court&#39;s and creditor&#39;s approval. <br><br>But maybe a wrench could be thrown in that process, if one of those creditors (especially the senior debt holder) held that DIP financing approval hostage and insisted on getting their position &quot;rolled up&quot; as part of the DIP financing. Basically as I&#39;m understanding it, they&#39;d get paid off as part of the administrative fees and essentially in super-priority along with the DIP creditor. Am I looking at that correctly?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Through my sources I&#39;ve a broker who contacted me with a sponsor needing a bridge loan to finish renovations on a MF property in a major southeastern MSA. Because this is my 1st loan scenario I&#39;ll run it by you here to get your thoughts before I submit.<br><br>Project is being worked on in two phases. Phase I has been completed with 24 units finished. Planned Phase II is for an additional 47 units for a total of 71 units in the project.<br><br>-- Current NOI = $23,000 (based on Phase I occupancy of 41%)<br>-- Proforma NOI = $422,700 (based on project completion of 71 units)<br>-- Current cap stack = Senior acquisition debt of $145,000 and additional $895,000 in sponsor LP equity shares.<br>-- Sources and Uses <br>                        SRC: New loan for $2,281,849<br>                        USE: $2,136,849 Phase II renovations (47 unit completion) &amp; soft costs<br>                                 $145,000 Senior debt payoff<br>                                 $2,281,849 total<br>This is a 54% LTV loan against the stabilised proforma NOI above at a 10 cap.<br><br>--Narrative:<br>Sponsor and team are strong and very experienced renovating and operating multifamily apartments in the target city. The main sponsor has over 10yrs plus in the space and has been doing multifamily in the city since 2010. Other members of his team have 14 and 25 yrs in project management and RE accounting experience. They currently own 8 properties totalling 334 units in the city, all renovated and operated by them since 2010.<br><br>Property was purchased with a loan for $145,000 as an REO and sat vacant for a few years. Sponsor sold shares in the LLC to raise $895,000 and began Phase I, bootstrap renovating 24 units. Current vacancy is leased with 10 units of those 24 filled using rent concessions. Sponsor is negotiating with the city for property specific vouchers that pay up to 150% of market rent.<br><br>Exit is to renovate property up to 71 units, then rent up to stabilisation and refinance us out within 3-5yrs. <br><br>Sponsor is aware that we are a bridge funding source, our terms and expenses.<br><br>My Thoughts:<br>I am currently waiting on a unit mix and proforma NOI for the Phase I / 24 units portion only so I can get a better idea of what we are working with while Phase II is being completed.<br><br>With some due diligence, a background check and a look into the sponsor&#39;s past projects to see their results, it seems doable. On the face of it, if I had the money to do this one, I would seriously consider it.<br><br>Please let me know if this is something you&#39;d like me to submit for funding. Thanks!        </p>

          Its small, but lets see. what was the value he valued the project for when he sold share in the LLC to investors (ie raised equity)? <br><br>That&#39;s really what he did. He raised equity. <br><br>Also, he spent $37,291 and only &quot;bootstrapped&quot; the renovations? That seems very, very high. How do you know he&#39;s is experienced when he pisses money away like this? <br><br>Also, which city is this in? <br><br>Tell me more to chew on. <br><br>Tell me more.         </p>

          Had a chat with the broker yesterday and am waiting to get some additional color on some of your points above, including a rent roll and operating statements. <br><br>There may be a phone call directly with the sponsor, as I asked for info on the sponsors skin in the game and alignment of interests on this deal.<br><br>This sponsor purchases low income housing in Memphis at REO. He has a small online profile on Google and I saw a couple of newspaper write ups on other properties that he&#39;s renovated in the city. <br><br>The &quot;Bootstrapped&quot; term was used by the broker. I asked about why there was a $38k per door cost to renovate each 2/1 unit. They clarified and said that they rebuild these properties from the studs up to ensure they pass HUD housing quality standards and tenant move in inspection on the Memphis Housing Choice voucher program. I asked for a renovations cost schedule to see where the money is going.<br><br>Here is some updated info they  did give me on the Phase I - 24 unit portion:<br>SOURCES:<br>Senior Debt: $148,400<br>Equity: $917,600<br>Total: $1,066,000<br><br>USES:<br>Purchase Price and Costs: $66,000<br>Renovations: $1,000,000<br>Total: $1,066,000<br><br>Current NOI: $23,000<br>Proforma NOI: $79,034<br>Vacancy 41%. 10 out of the 24 units are rented<br>-- Market rents at $513 mo but current tenants in the 10 units with rent concessions at $399 mo. All 24 units are 2bd/1ba.<br><br>Broker told me that Memphis City has a voucher program for 150% of market rent. I can&#39;t find anything aside from the standard Section 8 voucher program offered by the Memphis PHA. Section 8 pays roughly up to 75-80% depending on income.<br><br>I&#39;ve asked for color on this as aside from the successful renovation of Phase II, relying on this 150% voucher program seems to be their key event to get to their 71 unit stabilized pro-forma NOI of $422,700. This all seems pie in the sky and may be the broker puffing some of the voucher numbers up to sell the deal to me. I am looking forward to getting answers on this or talking with the sponsor directly.<br><br>        </p>

          Hi Sal, is there a continuing ED or something in our materials on LP Secondaries and how to analyze them as potential deals? I read somewhere that trading data on Real Estate backed LP Secondaries is or might be available to help evaluate these?         </p>

          Can&#39;t wait. If the due diligence and sourcing on these could be locked down, I wonder if they could potentially be a good outside the box fund strategy. Like Patricia&#39;s tax lien fund. These are very interesting to me. But also like a shiny new toy. I&#39;m actually glad there&#39;s nothing for me to dive into as I have so much to study now.        </p>

          Good morning Sal, I have a line on an off market pre-foreclosure shopping center here in Southern California. They lost their major anchor grocery back in spring of 2014 and subsequently about half of their other tenants went dark. There is still a CVS hanging on (I don&#39;t know what&#39;s left on their lease or what type). <br><br>The property is within 1/2 mile of a Walmart, and other major retailers including a Food For Less and down the street from a very active Home Depot. There is a completely empty shopping center across the street that looks to be an old KMart. To be honest the economy in the community is a bit depressed and hard hit, but it&#39;s not a war zone by any stretch and is literally next to a major highway.<br><br>NOD has been filed and although it&#39;s not listed, rumors are they are getting ready to try and sell. From the property records they have a $13m mortgage and are in default of about $1.3m. I don&#39;t know where the default lies in the capital stack just yet.<br><br>I have two questions, before I get into it with the owners. What would be the play here? Try to see about helping with funding then maybe consider it for a possible distressed acquisition? <br><br>And, how does it work when you need an anchor tenant for something like this? I&#39;m thinking you have to find a qualified sponsor first then the rest might fall into place. So there would be two key events: Find Sponsor, get anchor?<br><br>Thanks for any help        </p>

          Mark, <br><br>You need a date to the prom. All you have is a tux. You need a qualified operator who can bring in the anchor tenant. That is a big value-added play but you need to see what is driving the distress in the community. <br>Where (generally) is this located? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Understood. This is in one of the high desert communities outside the Los Angeles basin. I don&#39;t know would be the answer on the community distress. Residential is flat with much of the community being working class and lower middle class people who commute into LA everyday. Home sales are flat and while trying to move some houses that I own via rent to own, many people I&#39;ve come across don&#39;t have much money saved or credit.<br><br>The Kmart looks to have closed a few years ago and according to my source the major grocery in this center got caught up in corporate closures.<br><br>So, as a beginner in the commercial space if anything were to get started on this one, in order to find a date, would one idea be to try and leverage some relationships with (pro) commercial brokers who can help find a sponsor?<br><br>What generally would the timing be on a potential acquisition. Find a sponsor first and then approach the owner, or try to get it under contract somehow with a 60-90 day escrow and find a QS before closing.        </p>

          1. Use the LinkedIn Leaders (you should have...) to speak a few Retail Developers in the ICSC groups. <br><br>If you don&#39;t have LinkedIn Leaders, why?<br><br>*https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=426*<br> <br>2. Get color from them. See if they are interested. LA is a great MSA but K-Mart is going under and so is Sears. The developers are good at what would be a good fit there.         </p>

          Hi Sal, This might be a helpdesk question. I was going through the 30k in 30 days Infographic and working on apartments on the MLS.  it mentions to enter prospective property info into the &quot;Private Banker Lite&quot; - Is that an excel model that&#39;s named something else now?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>Have another deal coming down the pipe..This one on the up and up, and totally legal!<br><br>This is a small bank REO resort property in a tier1 city under contract by an investor who contacted me for possible bridge financing. The bank is offering financing. I&#39;m thinking that the bank rates will be much better than we could get them on a bridge loan, so I&#39;m looking at structured equity deal and would want help from you guys to put it together for a raise or provide the equity capital.<br><br>It&#39;s a value play and I think the exit would be to repair it and try to get it flagged. <br><br>I have most of my numbers and info, but the property hasn&#39;t been in operation for about two years. So no Current NOI. I am waiting for the historical data to come in from them, but I need to be reminded of how to build NOI from scratch, if needed, so I can tee up some good numbers for you. Is it something like:<br>- Vacancy at 10-15% of gross<br>- Reserve at 15% of gross<br>- Property taxes from assessment<br>- Find market rates on maintenance etc..<br>- And finally, do I build the estimated rents from the unit rental rates like normal?<br><br>Thanks<br>Mark<br><br><br>        </p>

          Resorts are not very attractive. Please clarify if it is a &quot;resort&quot; or a flagged hotel? Does it have a flag? <br><br>Why did it go into trouble in the first place? <br><br>No NOI use the &quot;price per pound approach&quot;. which means, what it the what is the price that these things have traded at in that vicinity. <br><br>What is the sponsor&#39;s experience who is buying this?

          Great, I&#39;ll be talking directly with the sponsor tomorrow or Thursday and will qualify their experience.<br><br>Good to know that resorts aren&#39;t necessarily desirable. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s currently flagged or not. I&#39;m actually the one who thought that if the resort property was of the right type and quality, that we might be able to go after getting it flagged after the renovations are completed. I will get more info on the property and what type of resort it is later tonight. <br><br>Getting a flag takes a special kind of sponsor, am I right? So in most cases, we would have to go out and find the proper sponsor if the property were a candidate, am I correct?<br><br>Although I have some info gathered, I don&#39;t want to piecemeal stuff in forum posts. So I&#39;ll gather the additional information and get us a fuller picture within a couple days.<br><br>Thanks for your help        </p>

          I know this isn&#39;t something Dandrew would consider, but does anyone have any experience in raising equity to purchase property that will lease out to a legal medicinal cannibis grow and retailer in Colorado? Specifically issues regarding getting the LLC refinanced out institutionally with such a high risk (possible Fed civil forfeiture) tenant? Any advice appreciated        </p>

          Hi Sal or team, I watched in some of my older courses that you mentioned the possibility of a mailing list source for commercial loans that may be coming due. These videos were old so the info may be outdated. I&#39;m getting ready to ramp up some marketing. I have sources for residential but can&#39;t find any for commercial..Can you point me in a good direction? Thanks!        </p>

          The info isn’t out dated, just the initiative has changed. Before I wanted to release this to the Dandrew Nation, I wanted to test this data myself. <br><br>We spent $1200 and all we got was crap.  <br><br>Needless to say, we never went further with that. <br><br>However, that’s not to say there aren’t real sources for data out there. I’m just looking for the most cost effective for the Intermediaries. And it might be that it is expensive to get what you actually need. I have some convos going on in NYC now with a firm. I&#39;ll know more around Dec. <br><br>That’s what I have for you so far.<br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Hi Sal!,<br>Is it totally outside the norm for a sponsor to insist on pari-passu treatment of they equity placed by institutional investors? I have a couple of equity providers who are wanting senior equity positions, which is a deal breaker at this point for my sponsor.        </p>

[SHUT UP]. <br><br>Sound irritated. He will not walk.

          We did exactly this. I let him know that among my institutional capital partners, they all will want the senior position at this level of sponsor participation. That we could get a pari-passu deal done, but they&#39;d have to bring significantly more cash equity in and my investors will want more controls to manage their risk. <br><br>I passed on the deal and have put them on ice. Haven&#39;t heard from them yet will let you know if this one comes back around.<br><br>A bigger benefit was that I found another real equity player who is interested in seeing more of my deals because of the way I handled this one and tee&#39;d it up. Very happy..<br><br>Thanks Sal!<br><br>PS -- I&#39;ll see what I can do about Vegas        </p>

          Mark Rios, from Los Angeles. <br><br>I&#39;m going to tell you something that will make you very successful and happy going forward. <br><br>Sponsors are disposable. Its the capital providers you want to be nice to. You pledge your allegiance to them first and foremost. They will pay you well. Sponsors can be flakey. Capital providers, for the most part, aren&#39;t. <br><br>I&#39;m glad you were able to establish a relationship with a capital provider. You may not have closed a deal yet, but the fact that they respect you will pay far larger dividends later. (Ask me how I know that...)<br><br>*I look forward to hearing you tell all of us this case study in Las Vegas in January...*<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I have a pref equity deal come across my desk from a sponsor. In looking at the numbers on the Exec Summary, he is charging an acquisition fee, an asset management fee and a capital transaction fee at the sale. From the looks of this and the other numbers, it looks like he has oriented his offering materials and numbers towards a syndication with retail investors rather than receiving institutional capital.<br><br>Are those fees to the sponsor normal in institutional pref equity transactions? Negotiable? Or are retail syndications/institutional funding on a completely different fee structure?<br><br>Thanks!        </p>

          No institution will pay those fees. Those are called &quot;loads&quot; and are more commonly found in retail offferings .<br><br>Do not send to an institution. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi, <br><br>Just a comment and conversation starter..The paragraphs below are from Preqin&#39;s Sept RE Spotlight Newsletter -- Outlook section:<br><br>++<br><br>&quot;Positive sentiment is driving further investment in the asset class in the short term and further growth in the asset class is expected over the long term as more investors are planning to increase their allocations than reduce them.<br><br>Also contributing to investor satisfaction is the alignment of interests between investors and fund managers. However, a large proportion of investors have decided not to invest in a fund due to the proposed terms and conditions, indicating fund managers need to be sure they are aligned with market rates or can effectively justify the fees they charge if they want to ensure these issues are not an obstruction in gaining commitments from investors.<br><br>However, investors are still concerned about a range of interrelated issues including valuations, deal flow and performance. How fund managers address and mitigate these concerns could be the differentiator in a successful fundraise within the highly competitive fundraising environment.&quot;<br><br>++<br><br>The things that stick out to me are the Alignment of Interests regarding fees and the justification of them. I&#39;ve seen a few decks where the sponsors were charging fees that didn&#39;t seem in line with what I&#39;m hearing are investor&#39;s concerns nowadays. Then I&#39;ve seen another fund that states boldly and upfront that the only fees they receive are the management and a performance fee. The mgmt fee only paid AFTER investor capital has been deployed and the performance fee is only paid after investor returns and a IRR hurdle is reached.. Basically saying..&quot;we don&#39;t get paid until after you do...&quot; <br><br>I wonder would delaying the management fee put a burden on a new fund manager, who may see struggles to making it through until all the capital is deployed?<br><br>Also &quot;valuations, deal flow and performance&quot; being the biggest concerns by institutional investors surveyed -- all things that we are specifically trained to look out for and are working towards expertise on, no?        </p>

          Mr. Mark Rios from Los Angeles, <br><br>Yes, most fund managers don’t have a freakin clue as to what a waterfall is. Which is why they pay you and Dave Dejewski $25,000 a pop. <br><br>Here’s what comes first. You need a management fee that is in line with the industry/funds objectives. Pushing this off is not appropriate and I’ve seen newbie FMs say they will do this. Unfortunately, how are you going to pay overhead and staff if you’re going “dry’? It won’t happen. That is a failure. *But it should be only on deployed capital.*  <br><br>The incentives (or as you people in LA call it “performance fees”…) should always be aligned.  <br><br>All of which is detailed on the waterfall infographic here: <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=352<br><br>Unless the FM has a stellar track record or is putting in a lot of his or her own money, it’s the LPs that get their money and their returns back first. <br><br>Not pari-pasu or &quot;even Steven&quot;. <br>And yes, you all want to see valuations, deal flow and performance – like you have been highly-trained to do. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Reading a bit on club deals...so are they usually single-asset, transactional types of investments? Like syndication for institutional investors? or are they more like funds,  where multiple properties can be purchased under one company.<br><br>Or does the structure not really matter..and it&#39;s really about big investors coming together for a common investment strategy? A true Joint Venture between bug players looking to take down big properties?        </p>

          A Chicago development firm has approached me for funding ($40 MM for land purchase) to be put into a Schwab account for 90-180 days to return 30% (or equity) to show liquidity to committed funders (they have contracts) for a 100 story tower in the South Loop - multi use, offices and luxury condos. There are warranties from funders for the remaining construction cost - $400 MM total. Expected to appraise at $670 MM. Sponsor and funding partner have spent $20 MM in pre-development costs.  <br><br>A most interesting part of the project is the overall design was done by SPDM, with all architectural services to be performed by Loewenburg &amp; Fitch, Architects, one of the premier high-rise designers.  And the“preeminent structural engineer in the world”, Charles H. Thorton, Ph.D., P.E., Founding Principle of Thornton Tomasetti and TTG Systems, will implement their new construction technique that builds the tower from the top down, after the core has been formed (Go to www.ttgcorporation.com and click on the Dubai and Russian Mission projects).  <br><br>There is an end of Sept. deadline for the land purchase, but, some of the buildings are still inhabited so will require a 6 month period before residents are out and tear down has been completed.  This is the main reason funding has stalled on this.<br><br>I have all the docs.  <br><br>Thanks - I really don&#39;t know how you get through all these &quot;Ask Sal&quot; questions in such a timely manner.<br>Jacqueline        </p>

          Question on this..Isn&#39;t asking for funding of $40m to be held in a Schwab account for 3-6 months at 30% return a glaring red flag? They are basically asking for proof of funds aren&#39;t they?<br><br>On a side note I saw a skyscraper on sale by a &quot;broker&quot; on LinkedIn for $450m +3% buyers premium... I&#39;m like, hmm $13.5m commission just for posting on LinkedIn eh?        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>Question regarding a sponsor&#39;s existing investors and the General Partnership in a newly forming fund. I thought I heard somewhere in one of the videos that it&#39;s possible to offer one of your existing investors GP shares in exchange for fund startup money or even as the GPs capital commitment to align interests with the LP investors. I can see where this might be beneficial to a team with limited financial resources to contribute. It would help put them in a better negotiating position with their LP investors. Is bringing on an investor on the GP side something that happens a lot? <br><br>And if so, what are the incentives for an investor to join the GP side vs the LP side where the pref and split can be very lucrative? I&#39;m thinking, foremost would be having fund level decision-making abilities as well as being part of the asset level discretion conversation. I&#39;m also thinking that rewarding a loyal investor with an inside track that no one else has is a good incentive as well.        </p>

          Mark Rios from Los Angeles. Thank you for your question. <br><br>Yes, bringing on investors into the GP level is a good idea, however, it could quickly turn into the GPs not having and discretion and having their LPs in their business all day. You have to have the right LPs you want to work with who are a good fit. Usually these are an institution, such as a family office. Mom and Pop retail investors don’t understand this and they should really not be given anything other than B shares. <br><br>What are you trying to do? It sounds like these guys don’t have *any* money and they are desperate. If you give someone decision-making authority (“discretion”) then that could really make things messy.         </p>

          No deal on this one..just a hypothetical..<br><br>Yes, I see now that avoiding mom and pops on the GP side makes much better sense. Money sources are NOT always equal..Thank you for pointing that out.        </p>

          Good morning Sal. I&#39;ve been approached through my marketing for a possible fix and flip credit facility by a Luxury/Trophy Home rehab investor looking to expand his business out here in SoCal. He has cornered a niche market in a few of the high end, closed communities of Palm Springs, CA. where the end buyers are very wealthy and desire product of the type he is creating. <br><br>He&#39;s completed about $6mm in the past 12 mos, mostly raised by Dr. and Dentist equity, HNR&#39;s who love him but are tapped out. He has another $10m in product under contract with a total of $20m in available homes to work on over the next year. Most of these homes are off-market deals, and in some communities he is the only investor in the area. I&#39;m waiting on his deal spreadsheet, but it seems he has some deal flow.<br><br>I floated the following ideas past him in this order:<br><br>1) Look into a credit facility or line with our sources. I told him we aren&#39;t so hot on luxury homes because of the possible long days on market to try and find the right buyer. So this may not be an answer.<br>2) Put together a package for Raj at BOI - They have a Socal only Luxury Home program that might fit this very well. I&#39;ve found a few other funds that offer credit lines for this type of investor between 65-80% LTC.<br>3) Lastly, collect a 10k engagement fee and work on their pitch materials, go on the road and try to raise a fund on his business plan.<br><br>Let&#39;s start with this: Is this something we or any sources you know of would like to take a look at for a credit facility or any sort of equity participation? Knowing that he&#39;d need to come to the table with something, they specifically asked that if we were to take this to a place like BOI, would we be interested in providing some equity to help on the 20-35% portion?<br><br>        </p>

          Mark<br><br>$10,000? You’re a cheap whore. But OK. Next time $15,000. Here&#39;s why: <br><br>However, this is a *great question.* <br><br>This isn’t really a good candidate for a line of credit. That model is not really good here as this guy will have to make a monthly vig to the bank and if he is sitting on inventory that’s not selling, he’s going to run into a textbook cashflow problem. <br><br>Here’s what you need to do: you want to create a *targeted residential velocity fund* (aka a “flipper fund”). Here’s how this would work: <br><br>- Invested capital is pooled into a fund using a fund structure. <br><br>- Capital is invested into one or several houses, each with their own business plans for fixing and divesting in a *short, but defined period of time*. No open-ended deals. Each house has its own fuse, as secured by a non-accruing lien on the property in the name of the fund. Like an unpaid mechanics lien, but in first position. If he’s not out in a period of 8-12 months, the fund forecloses. The lien has nothing to do with the investors in the fund, it’s just security for the fund to ensure the collateral is secured. <br><br>- This is strictly an equity fund for your investors, and they get paid a promote and profit splits either semi-annually or annually. So I would offer them a 60 after an 8%. <br><br>- If structured correctly, this could be replicated across for many other rehabbers at these levels. This could become your “special sauce” to the community. <br><br>- *If you need handholding, its $15,000 for me to walk though this with you and model it out and do the deck, so if you’re charging $10,000 – which I think is faaar too cheap for this fund structure, you will have to sell a kidney to have me do the extracurricular work.* But this may be worth it to you as you’d be able to not only sell the model as a consultant, but actually do the model yourself. <br><br>Aren’t you glad I’m your pal? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Oooh this is great.. This capital raise stuff get me excited..<br><br>I haven&#39;t actually quoted them the $10k, so there&#39;s still a chance to put a little better lipstick on and get that $15k.<br><br>The cash flow issue makes complete sense, and that&#39;s his catch-22..His current investors are tapped and waiting to get cashed out and what would be the vig is accruing...I think he&#39;s reached out to hard money and at any coupon rate, he can&#39;t turn over these non-bread and butter homes quick enough to service the debt.<br><br>I&#39;ll take a look deeper into what you are saying. I doubt I&#39;ll need hand holding, but if we get into it I&#39;ll have questions!!<br><br>Thanks<br><br>PS - my first bid and LOI went to a bank on that gas station note..looks like they are close on pricing so we&#39;ll see if it hits!        </p>

          Small update: This client is looking to place one or two loans at BofI in their Luxury Home program. I&#39;ll be able to broker those. <br><br>Also, This client is also warming up to creating pitchbook, capital raise and creating his own fund around his business plan..I quoted the full $25k as retainer fee if we were to do it and it didn&#39;t seem to be a problem for him.<br><br>He did want to know if we had any numbers on how successful these types of capital raises are. What his chances might be. I told him I didn&#39;t know, but I&#39;d research his niche and get back to him.  Should I look into sources like Preqin for that sort of data?<br><br>So my next question would be, I need to sign a separate engagement letter for each phase, correct? An initial one for the brokering services to BofI (or wherever we place his loans) where I would ask for maybe a point on his loans... and then another if we come to something on his pitchbook/capital raise, and I need to get the retainer fee and some juice from the profits of his fund?        </p>

          Hey Sal can you help me perfect my quick over the phone pitch for that first time call to an ERISA plan coordinator when trying to raise money for a HM debt fund? How is this, <br><br>&quot;Hello Mr./Ms. XXXX, my name is Nique and I am raising capital for a commercial real estate debt fund that targets an 8-10% return to investors. We’re going to be in non-owner occupied residential, that’s the space we know best and don’t plan to deviate from that. The fund seeks to structure risk out of the transaction by using an unlevered capital structure that will allow investors to participate using their ERISA defined contribution retirement plans. The fund will only be making first trust deed or mortgage loans at a very low basis. Might that be of interest to you?&quot;<br><br>Hopefully that will spur on further conversation.<br>Look forward to 5/28! Thanks!        </p>

          Sal, for my first hard money velocity fund, in your opinion, would it be too much style drift to include the acquisition of distressed and performing notes along with originating quick turn fix and flip loans? I like both businesses, and I&#39;ve seen hard money decks that had both investment strategies, but I&#39;m thinking it might be worth it to concentrate on one for my first offering.         </p>

          Comment from a new customer: &quot;Do you have an example of a tear sheet and pitch book that we could pattern ours after?&quot; <br><br>I told them I would not even try to raise capital for them unless they had a tear sheet and pitch book. <br><br>He has a stabilized single asset in need of renovation with a $9MM loan from Arbor that needs $5MM in equity.

          Tell him you do after the check clears. <br><br>Use the consulting agreement and engagement letter and show him the model. The pitchbook shouldn&#39;t be given away for free. They will struggle with the model and then come to you for help out of frustration.         </p>

          FYI: I didn&#39;t need to send them the model. They just called and will be cutting me a check for a single asset pitch book ASAP. I explained that whether they are successful with this raise or not, they will have an evergreen fundraising tool for their tool box. <br><br>This project is to syndicate $5MM of equity for a $14MM stabilized (91% occupied) C+ multi-family project in a C+ neighborhood in North Charleston, SC (the good section West of 26). This could be played as a Core or a Core-Plus, but they are playing it as a value-add / opportunistic deal. Their concept needs more investigation. <br><br>As is:<br>- $14MM purchase price under contract at a 5 cap<br>- Current NOI: $738,000<br>- Proforma NOI: $940,000<br>- Arbor brought them the deal and will be in first position for $9.1MM (65% LTV). The sponsor has a few hundred K into the deal in the form of deposits, etc (minimal / weak). They want to use the money for acquisition and renovation. <br><br>Their strategy depends on three things: 1. organic rent increases (weak play, but they are 2% below the area in occupancy and $40-$175 below monthly rental rates for the area) 2. upgrading 50% of the units (increasing rent) and 3. recent local government commitment to opening a new entrance to the airport, the Panama Canal expansion (a source for ship traffic up the Ashley river), and a 2.3% employment growth in the city since 2011. Their strategy is to renovate 139 of the 280 (50%) of the units and increase the rent by $125 / month on these units. It remains to be seen if they can do this, but they claim there are two key members on their management team who have proven track records with this kind of repositioning. I am collecting their deal book and management bios &amp; intend to probe deeper. I have not heard them mention carrying costs for the downed units while under construction, for example. <br><br>My cynicism has me focused on their key events, their management team, and the wisdom of trying to reposition a C+ multi-family in a C+ neighborhood. It might be in an area along a newly defined path of progress - in which case, it might work, but we have some homework to do. I am told their team has a lengthy deal book that proves the concept has been executed by this team in other geographies in the past. <br><br>In any case, I will get a single asset pitch book fee and they get an evergreen fund raising tool for their tool box. <br>Good trade.         </p>

          Thank you...even this little bit will help bring me closer to closing these guys...&quot;Travel Agent&quot; deleted. Completely understood.<br><br>Here is a very rough draft of what I have on pg 1: http://j.mp/TrisourceCapitalAdvisors<br><br>I wanted to do a pg 2 &quot;About&quot; section - What is your feeling on us riding your coattails a bit on this, to build some credibility, if we keep your name out of it? <br><br>I was thinking something like:<br><br>Trisource Capital is an intermediary to a principal, institutional funding source and former Wall Street investment banker who acts as manager for two active commercial real estate funds. Fund manager spent five years with a major Wall Street investment bank before breaking off and founding his own boutique capital advisory firm. Among other services, one current area of focus is on the raising of capital through institutional sources; alternative-asset hedge funds, family offices, smaller pension funds and also some high net worth individuals, including SDIRA investors. <br><br>As intermediaries to the funds, Trisource Capital receives exclusive, in-depth training, as well as inclusion in mentoring programs for investment banking and commercial real estate. Along with direct access to originating commercial bridge loans and institutional funds for the purchase of non-performing mortgage assets, Trisource Capital is launching a pilot program as capital formation consultants for select clients, under the personal guidance of fund manager. This is in response to a very real need of real estate investors, operators and sponsors looking to expand their businesses and create funds aligned with their business plans.<br><br>Let me know if that won&#39;t work.<br><br>I have the book.<br><br>I&#39;ll be in Vegas.        </p>

          Yes, that&#39;s a great idea, will post to Elance today and get it cleaned up. And with the single sentence above we won&#39;t need a second page - I&#39;ll place it on the first. There&#39;s no rush on getting it out so we can tweak next week if it comes up.         </p>

          Hi Sal, <br><br>We didn&#39;t get a chance to work on this or the Luxury Home Velocity Fund I&#39;m working on, but there was such great info at the workshop, I&#39;m very glad I went so thanks. Looking forward to any tapes of the event being released, as I know we had to move through some material quickly at some points.<br><br>Inspired, I started work on the next iteration of this info-doc..I added a page 2 with some info on pitchbook creation:<br>http://j.mp/TriSourceCapitalAdvisors<br><br>This hasn&#39;t been proofed yet and I will outsource proofing before releasing it..        </p>

          Question on sponsor experience on CMBS assumable deals that have a NNN tenant. <br><br>I was poking around, spreading the word on Loopnet about my bridge lending and structured capital services, when I started thinking about the structure of some of the deals popping up. <br><br>So, say someone comes to us looking for the equity portion of a CMBS assumable loan, with over 7 years left, and that property is under an absolute NNN lease with a national credit tenant. <br><br>It seems maybe the benefits of buying a NNN property is to get as close to possible to being passive and clipping coupons. And the property is being maintained by the credit tenant, so in this instance are we still qualifying them on their specific operating experience in the asset class, or maybe management experience? <br><br>PS-This is in reference to an corporate backed absolute NNN w/ Best Buy out here in SoCal, where the bldg is for sale at $45mm. Assumable loan, 8 years out and down payment $17mm - Tenant takes care of everything except for roof and exterior HVAC unit.        </p>

          Mark:<br><br>Correction. It’s “structured financial products”. <br><br>There is experience in this asset class that is needed. There is a a reason why people buy apartments first as the gateway drug to commercial and retail as it take experience understanding the leases. But you are correct, it’s the asset itself is much more manageable.<br><br>Regarding BestBuy, now we’re talking a different issue. Will BestBuy continue to have stores in the next 7 years? What is the go dark clause in the leases? <br><br>See what I mean? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Yes, now I can see how one might stumble into a deal in an asset class over their head without experience in the lease structure..<br><br>It&#39;s funny, the first thing I think of every time I look at that Best Buy listing is Circuit City, so I can appreciate your pointed questions on that one. There&#39;s a vulnerability with the electronics stores...Good Guys, CompUSA, Circuit City, Radio Shack...there were even rumors Fry&#39;s was in trouble a couple of years ago..I actually would think that there&#39;s a 50/50 chance something might happen to Best Buy.<br><br>And thanks for the correction Sal! I&#39;m glad you caught that, as I&#39;m sure it&#39;s something I&#39;ve said in a phone call somewhere..        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>In analyzing assumable NNN deals, I came across one that has a great BBB- tenant in place, in a well known but smaller CA market w/ 350k+ population, 15+ years left on the loan at 5%, with 3x5 year options on the lease. <br><br>It&#39;s offered at a 7 CAP.  Question is, with these assumable NNN deals, do you try to negotiate off the asking price too much? Or are these deals, like seller financing in residential, that you are able to offer closer to their asking price? I&#39;m trying to think of what leverage a buyer has to try and get the deal at an 8 or 9 CAP. <br><br>And because I don&#39;t have much experience, would a 10% annual total return (3% cash return + equity buildup) seem desirable to retail investors? (seems low to me)        </p>

          How long is left on the lease? <br><br>And equity build up is not an incentive. I have no idea what you are talking about there. <br><br>The coupon is the coupon. And for this they will want a higher cash return.         </p>

          It looks like the loan is coterminous with the lease at 14 years left, not 15 like I wrote above. <br><br>Got it. The equity buildup not an incentive. I didn&#39;t explain that. I think they are counting the principal paydown for each year as part of the annualized ROI of 10%<br><br>So on this they are asking $4.6m at a 7 cap, and the existing loan is $2.9m with a down payment of $1.7m - Since it&#39;s NNN, the only way to get more cash on cash return would be to come in with less of a down payment?        </p>

          Mark<br><br>We’re going to release something closer to the fall of 2015 using our NNN fund as one big instructional case study. <br><br>Some other answers for you so you sound more “seasoned”:<br><br>“Equity buildup”. Never, ever say this. <br>Instead say *”Market Equity”*. Say that 3 times. <br><br>In the models we use, that is calculated, but it is not really a compelling factor in these deals. Saying you are paying down the debt is something that is expected not really an incentive. People who invest want monthly or quarterly coupons. <br><br>With these deals, its what you see is what you get. Remember, these are *stabilized* deals, not *value-added* deals.  <br><br>And equity (or down payment) is not a function of higher returns. <br><br>Be patient until I get through some training for you guys. OK? <br><br>For the time being, just speak to investors. That is the best experience you can get right now. <br><br>Then when its go time, you’re off to the races. <br>Sal        </p>
