          Excellent stuff! I intend to become one of your best intermediaries. I am very serious about the previous sentence. I already have a couple of people working for me identifying bank balance sheet items in Colorado and New Jersey.   I typed a question on one of your webinars, if you know Gerry Guterman of Guterman partners in New York. I have done a lot of finance brokering and came into contact with him through a deal source provider.  He lost all his money (muni-bonds) at Lehman. He has a multi million dollar trust for his kids which he does not want to pledge.  He is looking for a financial partner.  I told him Dandrew specializes in the SBC market. He says that he wants to access a LOC or suitable instrument of $30-$50 mill so he can swoop in and pick up deals in NY where  foreigners are financing with hard money, cannot profit, then sell at a discount. His expertise is of converting and rehabbing large multi-family commercial projects nation wide. I have another affiliation of investors from Asia who may want to create a pool for him on deals larger than $30 million, but that could take months to get committments.  I do not want to put the cart before the horse, but how would I determine if there may be a good fit between he and Dandrew. (Conference call possibly?)  Gerry wants to get back into the game as his attorneys told him he will be lucky to get one cent back from Lehman.  Sorry for the rant Sal. Looking forward to working with you for a long time. Your advice is appreciated.         </p>

          John, <br><br>This looks good. I don’t get the “lost millions in muni-bonds at Lehman” BS, but perhaps you can tell me what that means. <br><br>What is an SBC market? I don’t know what this means. <br><br>*Send over his bio and deal sheet.* Asia investors will take a lifetime to get the money. Just get his bio and deal sheet, and anything he has as far as real estate investments. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,  (SBC - Small Balance Commercial)  He insists that he parked his money at Lehman Brothers and had his funds invested in Municipal bonds. Lehman went belly up and and he lost everything. Here is his website:<br>http://gutermanpartners.com  I will make sure that he gets us a bio if needed. He has been giving me stuff ranging from Beekman Tower to the W in Atlanta. He says that with $9 million, He could secure the W.   Would you like a list of deals he has done in the past?         </p>

          I want a list of what he&#39;s done in the past. But these deals usually kick off by him finding a deal that is interesting, we work together on that first. This isn&#39;t structured like he gets a Line of Credit. If he wants that, then he&#39;ll have to go to a bank and they are not going to probably give it to him given his financial history. <br><br>Send his bio and deal sheet. <br><br>Lastly, ask him who was the *issuer* of these muni bonds. I&#39;m smelling bullshit. Hint: its not Lehman. Its usually a government municipality...         </p>

          Hi Sal, This Gerry Guterman has an ego problem. He was incredulous that you did not know who he was, and got all pissed about it.  I do not want to work with drama queens, and I am sure you do not either. So, No Go with him. <br><br>As a relatively new Private Equiteer student, could you tell me which program to start with. I assume bulk arbitrage live? <br><br>I just purchased the book of e-mails.  I spoke with Marc Boucher of Inet USA. He says that you are revising our web fronts with a new template. Would you recommend holding off on sending e-mails until our fronts are updated? <br><br>Have a great weekend!        </p>

          I know of him and I&#39;ve probably sat in a few BOMA meetings with him here in NYC. What I don’t know is what has he done lately (deal-related). How did you find him? <br><br>His ego is a bit large; I remember in 2010 he wanted to bid on Peter Cooper / Stuyvesant complex from Ackman. I think he lost that bid. <br><br>Keep him in your sights; but don’t wash the baby out with the bathwater. I still don’t understand the Lehman thing.  <br><br>Regarding the website. Proceed as if Marc never told you that. I’m working on that now and it will be ready in May. I am planning on releasing it at the May 28-30 event. Get it now so that you’re grandfathered at the same rate. <br><br>Those who buy after will have to pay a lot more for it… <br><br>And start with AskDandrew Triage program first. Then Arbitrage, then fund structures vs JV (Private Equiteer)        </p>

          Hi Sal, Thanks for the intel. I met Guterman through a deal source provider.   I source deals for another PEG who looks for unlisted commercial stuff at $45 million and above. He has sent me some potential deals. <br><br>I think in order to help him, I would need to set up a fund. He would need around $50 million to do what he wants.   I am starting to put together a pitch book. Not sure if I know what the hell I&#39;m doing. I&#39;ve raised money for M&amp;A, but not commercial real estate. Any suggestions will be helpful.<br><br>I also have an attorney friend contacting community banks  for me in NJ.  I showed her how to use the FDIC site. She is finding assets all over the place.  I may have put the cart before the horse as I have not gone through all the training, yet I have people looking for assets already. If she gets me the list of stuff from the banks, would you like to look at it?  <br><br>Thank you for your time.        </p>

          Yes. Come to the 3 Day Event and you&#39;ll get it. I think there is one slot left if you bring an intern. If you are doing a fund for him and he&#39;s not invested anything to cover your costs, you&#39;re playing the fool. Don&#39;t do it, John. Let him flounder a bit and then come back to him *after* you know what the heck you&#39;re doing. I think he&#39;s not done anything really meaningful since the late 70s, early 80s (&lt;&lt; cough &gt;&gt; just like Trump &lt;&lt; cough &gt;&gt;...)<br><br>And in the meatime, go over your JV vs Fund Structures in your Private Equiteer system...<br><br>Regarding the assets, send only if a) you are *direct* and b) if you have *pricing expectations*. <br><br>Lastly, why do you have an attorney making these calls and how much are you paying them for this? This boggles my mind. <br><br>Sal<br><br>        </p>

          Sal, I understand. Gerry somehow thinks that I should have had the money yesterday.  He may be able to perform, or not.  Not worried about it. Once I get fundraising down, maybe I can do something. <br><br>My attorney is a friend who wants to make more money. I&#39;m not paying her a red cent unless we can get some deals done. She is essentially a bird-dog.   I am direct with her and not the banks.  She has sent me some correspondence from the banks that I could share with you if you&#39;d like. Once again, I may have started out the gate before the horn sounded.<br><br>When is the three day event sir?<br><br>Thanks for your help Sal, I may be flinging some poo at the moment, but hopefully we&#39;ll get that corrected soon.        </p>

I know, can&#39;t you believe it? <br><br>It will be essential, fundamental, and you’ll have the ability to switch on another source of revenue *on demand*. <br><br>You will like this. <br><br>Sal        </p>
