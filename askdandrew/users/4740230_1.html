          Sal,<br>Since this event in Las Vegas is going to be your last, I think I speak for those that are not going when I say, we wish you were not stopping, but some times its better to leave while on top.<br><br>I can only imagine what this event is going to cost you. have you given any thought into doing a live streaming type of preview and charge about $195.00 per person to attend , sort of like pay per view.<br><br>At $195.00, they get to attend live but from their living room or office, etc., video of the sessions after they attend, etc.<br>If you got 2500 people @ 195.00 each, you would gross $487,500.00, probably enough to cover your costs.<br><br>I was thinking about this as a suggestion.        </p>

          Hi Sal...What&#39;s the sentiment that a seller of a note should have if they have a 12% note selling it at 8%.  I&#39;m concerned that the buyer would see the original 12% yield and feel like they are being robbed.  How should I handle this?  Thanks, Hurol        </p>

          Hurol.<br><br>You are correct.

          I asked this question because I know a source for 12% interest NOO loans and the idea I had was to sell it off to retail investors at 8% interest yield...Is this above board? I ran some quick numbers on it and the gains are substantial ( I will have to go back though and check the ltv&#39;s)        </p>

          Yes. You can do this. Of course. it hasppens all day long. Just the more savvy and sophisticated investor won&#39;t buy into these. <br><br>But the guy who desperately wants 8% *desperately* will buy these all day long. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hurol,<br>I started in this business brokering note trades. As long as your fee is not out of the ordinary, you should not meet with resistance. Case in point, on a $50,000.00 note your not going to be fair in charging more than 1 to 1.5 points.<br><br>Don&#39;t fall victim to what these note courses tell you to charge, they are not realistic.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I had to jump off the call today and get onto a call for the medical project but wanted to comment on the guys deal he went into with you and AJ. This is for those looking at their first deal.<br><br>Sal has taught me to look more at the inner workings of the deal outside of the players to get at the real story of the deal and not what the country music love song highlights.<br><br>I look at deals daily with assumable mortgages and to the untrained eye, these look like selling points in the opportunity and they aren&#39;t selling points as much as red flags. <br><br>First, just because the loan is assumable doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s assumable for you or your client. The holder of that loan is going to want a very strong entity coming in. They don&#39;t want to have a good loan turn bad. <br><br>Next, you have to look at how long the investor is going to be in the deal. If they are paying $15,000,000.00 for a property and the NOI is $500,000.00 or even $1,000,000.00, how long is the investor going to be in the deal at it&#39;s worse case scenario.<br><br>The next thing to look at is what are the avenues available to get out of the deal and retire the capital and debt stacks. Can they refinance? is the timing of the market optimum for selling the property, what is the viable exit strategy.<br><br>I just wanted to pass these thoughts on.        </p>

          Rick,<br>My brother used these guys. They are reasonable compared to others and I believe it was like $99.00 upfront and you pay in installments. They run your credit immediately so they have up to the minute data. If your client would have issues with another inquiry in their credit report, he probably won&#39;t use them.<br><br>Definitely worth it.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is the latest update on the medical project. We have come to an agreement in principle on the property. We agreed to do a master lease on the property. One payment of $50,000.00 per year. The owner gets a seat on the board and will provide consulting services on the medical management side of the business for a 10% equity stake in the entire project.<br><br>Were going to meet with the architect and contractor tomorrow and do a walk through and get the complete construction and design costs in line and from this I can move to the next phase of the financials.<br><br>We&#39;ve begun discussions with a finance company who will finance patients. What were going to do is receive 10% of the cost of the procedure up front, then setup a payment plan for remainder and then sell the contract to this company. This firm will run the credit, draft the docs and pay us immediately.<br><br>This financial arrangement will be a selling point in the capital raise presentation because we are showing the investors how income will be generated and protected, outside of the cash paying patients and were not accepting insurance so there is no claims to deal with.<br><br>This is where we are at right now.        </p>

          sal,<br>I just watched the MHP deal in one of the looking over your shoulder training. I live in mobile home parkville. In North Texas, this is huge business and some of these parks are 200 to 500 pads, just mammoth in scope.<br><br>I am willing to bet for the right price, these could be purchased at attractive prices. Are you still entertaining these types of deals? what is your exact criteria as far as # pads, desired NOI, crietria for owned vs. rented, if owned and park is collecting lot rent, what is the minimum lot rent that makes it attractive, is self managed more attractive or is professional management more attractive, yes/no on seller financing.<br><br>I am always looking for deals and there are certainly deals in this asset class, here and I agree, they are cash cows and really a wave of the future.        </p>

          Sal, <br>I am learning the importance of not only qualifying the deal but the players as well. I&#39;ve concluded you can have the best deal but if you have players in the deal that don&#39;t bring value, the whole deal loses value.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is where I&#39;m at on this deal, what I have uncovered. It&#39;s a 55 plus mobile park community. 5 star level property with room to expand. Property is at 137 acres. No rent control and well established. On lake, all double wides. Stable cash flow w/ no distress. Lot rents are $382, $390, $409, $437 and $483 depending on lot location in park. Park uses 37 acres of the 137 acres. 100 additional acres for expansion or development.<br><br>2013 year end P&amp;L was Gross Income from all sources of $1,291,422.56 Total net operating income was $723,210.83.<br><br>This has an assumable loan on it. They are asking $14,000,000.00, however I believe that with the economy still in its current condition, the fact that there are not too many buyers, I believe there is a play here.<br><br>The strategy I think to make a play is to acquire the property net of the assumable loan. You obtain an appraisal or BPO on the 100 acres and do a joint venture with a developer. Depending upon the permissible use of this 100 acres, you sell off the 100 acres to the developer or a buyer.<br><br>The value in this deal I think is if you take the value of the park and the value of the 100 acres and add it together, and you back out the cost to acquire, you can make a sizable profit. I believe there could be an opportunity to a DPO on the assumable loan and add that debt service costs back into the Income of the property.<br><br>Now for the risk. The risk is that the seller may be asking too many times EBITA to make this worthwhile even with the income, NOI, the additional acreage. They may have invested too much money into the property and are trying to get that back out.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting in the first qtr 2014 numbers to see if there have been any dramatic changes in the numbers, too see if there have been any rent increases and as a result, a potential vacancy increase.<br><br>I&#39;m also going to contact the zoning board to see what the 100 acres is zoned for and to get an idea of what is happening in the area to see if this becomes a big box retailing growth area.<br><br>If big boxes are coming and the zoning permits for it or can be changed for it, there is significant upside in selling the 100 acres to one of those guys.<br><br>I will keep you posted.        </p>

          What if we did this deal structured in the following way. $10,000,000.00 cash to close now, $3,000.000.00 deferred for 18 months and we bring in a big box retailer to buy the 100 acres. We sell each acre at $85,000.00 per acre or $8,500,000.00. $3,000,000.00 deducted from sale proceeds leaves $5,500,000.00. Deduct this figure from the $13,000,000.00 paid and your in at a basis of $7,500,000.00.<br><br>We JV on this, I come in and manage this project hands on earning my back end equity piece from sweat equity.        </p>

          How about structuring it as follows...<br><br>Purchase price: $13,000,000.00 with $10,000,000.00 cash paid at closing<br>Assumable Loan: We assume this debt<br>Land placed into a LLC and we setup a equity share arrangement. We sell the LLC for $8,700,000.00 and we give the seller of the park, $1,000,000.00 from these proceeds.<br><br>The seller receives $11,000,000.00 total from the sale, which is equivalent to have received all cash anyway. <br><br>Out of the $7,700,000.00 balance, we do a DPO on the assumable loan, offering $500,000.00 for the debt and retiring it.<br><br>Of course the deal is contingent upon the values of both the park and the land proving out. I would go to California on a weekly basis and manage the deal and carry out all the initiatives to make the deal go as planned.        </p>

          Yes. We ignore these. Why? <br><br>Because these folks are looking to merely list their assets to have unsophisticated and inexperienced investors jump in and do all the brain damage of pricing these assets – only to say, “thanks, but no thanks”. <br><br>So, don’t be a sucker. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I got an email request that falls somewhat in a gray area so I&#39;m asking if we can do this. Its sort of grocery anchored, with NOI in line with the loan amount requested. If it was a string of dog kennels I would know the answer. But its borderline, so should I pursue this or decline:  <br><br>I&#39;m looking for $5 mil loan to purchase a package deal of 3 superamerica gas stations c/stores w/liquor franchises chain in Minnesota. The acquisition includes businesses with real estate.<br>The yearly gross revenue is $25 mil.<br>The net is $1.2 mil a year. after all the operating expenses, fees, the mortgages, the taxes and the pay roll are paid.<br>The market value of the businesses and the real estate is $7.5 mil<br>The stations can sale easily for $2.5 mil each.<br>I have 25 years experience in this Industry. I worked for oil companies managing the retail divisions. I also owned and operated similar businesses.<br>Our objective is to expand ,acquire more gas stations ,become a jobber ,sale fuel to other gas stations and dealers.<br>The loan will go directly to the seller(Oil company) to purchase this chain of gas stations.<br>Because of my Extensive Experience in this Industry The Oil company will put 20% for the down payment.<br>The Deal can be done one Gas station c/store at the time or the entire chain at once.<br>If you think you have the capability or what it takes to get me the other 80% of the Loan Contact me.        </p>

          I have a capital provider for these. Email me at structuredcommcap@gmail.com, the following:<br><br>State they are located in, Gross revenues, Net income, these need to include all sources such as c-store, fuel, car wash, etc.<br><br>Are year to date financials available and have they been audited, if yes, when. What is the value of the real estate and what is the capital stack. What is the value of the business seperate from the real estate.<br><br>What is the lease arrangement with the franchise and what is the franchise agreement in terms of royalties, having to use one supplier, How many years is the lease for.<br><br>How many gallons of fuel is pumped on a daily basis. Has a environmental study been done, what is the age of the tanks. Has a traffic study been done by the borrower. Why is this important? because the gas station businesses success is predicated upon traffic flow. How many other gas stations in the area.<br><br>What is the story of the deal? Is seller financing available, what are the terms, assumable loan? Terms. What is your capacity in the deal and how are you compensated?<br><br>With this, we can get started.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal, <br>I recently had a visit to  my offices from a gentleman I once had a deal going with in Austin that Peter turned down. The deal was for a student housing project at University of Texas that turned into a development deal and it was not doable.<br><br>He asked me if we are still in the same boat of not funding student housing and I told him yes, we are not in the business of ground up development. He said look, we are ourselves now in a position of having to locate properties already built that are dated, acquiring these and out of our own resources, funding the rehab/conversion but we may be needing funding to acquire.<br><br>I informed him that we would enjoy working with him and his firm on this. he asked about fees and points and  I quoted him 65 to 70% first, remainder to be hard cash equity that is seasoned and verifiable. I told him that if he wanted to cross colllateralize with another asset that is free and clear, he can pledge that. I quoted him 12 to 14% interest, interest only, 1 to 3 year term, 1 to 3 points.<br><br>He asked if they can buy down the interest and I said we can discuss this once we have a live deal in front of us. I told him that I need a bio of all the principals including himself and a brief overview of the project, time frame for needing the funds, exact sources and uses, where their equity is coming from, and a deal sheet of previous student housing projects they have completed and who they have funded through in the past. I also provided a list of the five data points obviously without Dandrews identity listed.<br><br>He told me that they dislike their previous funders and are looking to establish a new source. I told him to get all this together and we will work the deal at that time.<br><br>Any additional information you need to see?        </p>

          On the previous go around, the deal was a ground up development deal. I wanted to be firm and let him know that if he wants to send deals where they want ground up monies, were not in that space. <br><br>If they have projects where they can acquire a property such as a multi family and convert it then send it. I find that  sometimes I just have to be firm. I have no interest in wasting Dandrew&#39;s time.        </p>

          Here is what they want to do. They want to acquire multi family properties that are available as a REO or in some level of near vacancy, acquire them, rehab them, using their own resources and then market them as student housing properties that are upscale.<br><br>They will charge a monthly rent on a per room basis. They are offering to possibly pay the first six months of debt service immediately after closing, so they get ahead of the game.         </p>

          Sal,<br>This just came over this morning. It&#39;s a tape I received an overview email on. It&#39;s a tape of loans. <br><br>Portfolio UPB: $3.4 M<br>Total # Assets: 89<br>Average Loan Size: $41,549.00<br>Interest Rate Weighed Average: 9.7%<br>Lien Position: First Position across entire pool<br>Collateral locations: Nationwide<br>Collateral Type: Residential 1-4 Family.<br><br>I took a page from your strategies on the Bulk Live Videos, which is to get a overview first, then if it&#39;s worth a looksie, then get the tape.<br><br>Here&#39;s where I think the play is at. It&#39;s all firsts, residential, small portfolio but still above the minimum $2M. The loan balances are not very high which signals a potential to be closed out fairly soon. There is the potential to get the loan refinanced to buy us out and there is a potential to offer a DPO to the payor. Are these viable impressions?<br><br>The one concern I have is the loan size of $41,549.00. The risk is that the property values will be low and that&#39;s why the average loan is what it is.<br><br>Once I get the tape, should I send it?        </p>

          Sal,<br>One of the opportunities you&#39;ve helped a lot of us get into is the consulting business. The intellectual capital you&#39;ve provided has been tremendous in getting us in the door.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen a few here mention this a few times. My business has evolved more into that of a consultancy, really just on its own. It&#39;s been exciting, it&#39;s been challenging and I&#39;ve been documenting everything I&#39;ve been doing.<br><br>My struggle has been in pricing my services where I&#39;m getting fairly compensated for my work. I&#39;ve come up with a formula. Please provide some insight.<br><br>First, I have my exploratory call and client analysis. I&#39;m charging $500.00 for this, paid up front. This is a 1 hour job. I&#39;m essentially getting to know my client, what they want to accomplish, what they have done, their strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Next I have what I call financial tooling and re-tooling. This starts at $1500.00 paid up front and once this three hour time is exhausted, it&#39;s $250.00 per hour after. This is where I look at the deals they are doing, look at revenues, costs, losses, etc. I have an accounting degree, so this is stuff I know.<br><br>Next I have my Next Level Session. This is where we look at how they take a project to the Next Level. This is business, marketing and day to day operational plans. Did they source out funds yet, what did they say, did they put their best foot forward. We look at their chosen capital provider, can that provider actually fund their project, etc. This fee will be be $5000.00 with $2500.00 paid upfront, remainder 15 days later.<br><br>Now we move to Operation Deal. This is where we put together the five data points, the pitch book, marketing materials, financials, strategy for structuring the deal, put together the team which consists of financial, legal, compliance, brokerage, and others and we move forward.<br><br>I&#39;m charging  $10K for the pitch book alone and $15,000.00 for the remainder and of course im looking to craft in a equity piece if the project can support it.<br><br>My question is, am I charging too much, am I missing something?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I think one of the things that could be confusing those here is just what kind of deals can they submit. Good case in point would be the banker level submitting loan pools.<br><br>I think that saying look at the products sheets could be too general in nature.Another case in point. On the Structured products sheet, it says Land, however in order to submit those deals, you have to have purchased the Land Financier product. <br><br>A cheat sheet of sorts would be helpful, so those who really cannot submit those deals, will not waste their time as well as Dandrews. Any thoughts?        </p>

          Sal,<br>Wouldn&#39;t it be beneficial for those in the banker program to obtain a bio of the borrower as a standard operational protocol? I see the questions here about potential deals and your replies asking about the sponsor-operators experience with the type of deal they want to undertake.<br><br>I want to add this in for those reading this and trying to find their first deal. You will get many opportunities, especially if you have the credibility website. Many will never even be in your wheelhouse or Dandrews.<br><br>If someone is asking for a loan to buy an apartment building, has zero money for a earnest money deposit and has to call everyone in their family for the due diligence fees and the biggest deal they have done to date is a rehab on a triplex, chances of you getting this funded is slim. Its not even the monies needed, that issue can be solved with a partner, a JV structure, etc.<br><br>What cannot be overcome is experience. Look at it this way. You own a truck repair place and you need to hire someone and you get one person who interviews with you. If all they have done is car brakes at some quick repair place, are you going to hire them to repair diesel truck engines? probably not.<br><br>You have to not only qualify your deal, you also need        </p>

          Sal,<br>Many have asked me where I find companies with which to contact for opportunities. I use many resources, however, I do use a publication named Scottsman Guide.<br><br>They have a residential edition as well as a commercial edition. I use the residential edition to source potential sellers of loans. I get to see through their ads what they are lending on and this then triggers what types of assets they would possibly want to sell.<br><br>In the commercial edition, I can see through their ads of what they are lending on and determine if they may have commercial notes they want to move off of balance sheets, if they have funds that they want to finance out of that we can leverage, as well as other opportunities.<br><br>I thought I would pass this along. You can access this through Google, they have a digital edition online.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I had a call today from a broker who actually put me onto a call with a seller. The first question I asked is are you the legal owner of the assets and do you house the files at your office or through a storage facility.<br><br>Most brokers don&#39;t even know what a storage facility is and what the significance of theses are. I was on the phone with the seller and I&#39;m getting the tape. The broker on this deal is his attorney who has a lot of expertise with note dispositions and trades.<br><br>Anyway, the broker said that he would like to partner with my firm on deals. He realizes just how funds dislike broker deals. His idea is he will locate the deals and screen the sellers and I bring the buyers to the deal and we split fees 50/50 after expenses.<br><br>I informed him that my capital provider and fund does not entertain broker deals and he said he meets with this resistance everywhere that he connects with real sellers.<br><br>My question I am guessing would be since deals would be coming from my firm technically and my partner and I are splitting the fees and points, would this in Dandrew&#39;s view still be a broker deal?        </p>

          James. <br><br>when we send you your incentives, anything you promised the other broker or 3rd party comes out of those proceeds. Not ours. <br><br>So if we send you a wire at close for 40K, its your responsibility to pay your referrals from that pool of 40K. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Dan, <br><br>This refers to Self Storage Facilities. These are really just cement slabs with steel doors that hoarders use to store their crap in for a monthly fee. <br><br>These were also over build duing the late 2000s when every doctor and accountant wanted to become a “developer”. So there is a supply and demand issue. Too much supply. Not enough demand. So the price goes down. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on the medical project I am doing the capital raise for, it is really getting exciting and it really has taught me a lot.<br><br>We met with the owner of the subject acquisition property and we presented our offer of seller financing, ten years, 10% simple interest with one payment per year of $50,000.00 plus the interest.<br><br>He asked what we are going to do with the property and my wife said we need you to sign a confidentiality agreement first and he signed it. He is a retired medical doctor, so we did not want to lift our skirt first.<br><br>He came back with the following. He said that he likes the project a lot. He said why don&#39;t I give the property to you, since I own it free and clear and I have no real use for it and to get a buyer outside of us would take awhile.<br><br>He proposed that in exchange for the property, he gets a 15% equity stake in the entire project. He said he will make more money over the long term than selling the property outright and from a tax standpoint, this makes sense.<br><br>I will keep you posted as we go on.        </p>

          I&#39;m boosting my marketing by offering a 100% financing product to &quot;professional&quot; commercial real estate clients of real estate attorneys.  The offering will consist of part debt (whether it&#39;s existing or fresh)  and part equity (whether it&#39;s through capital raise or Dandrew).  Basically get one or the other from Dandrew - debt or equity that is- and get the remainder through a raise...but I had to sweeten the deal this way so I&#39;ll have the &quot;he who hold the gold makes the rules&quot; type leverage....basically this offer is to make up for my light experience but heavy intellectual capital.<br><br>-Hurol        </p>

          Huron,<br>Why would you offer 100% financing? Where is their skin in the game? being experienced is never going to take the place of having skin in the game.<br><br>Also are you going to amortize the loan over a long term with a balloon payment due in a shorter period of time? also if your going to do a capital raise, how will you structure the deal? what&#39;s in it for the equity investors?<br><br>How long are you going to keep the investors money tied up and how are you going to get it back to them? what if the investors want preferred equity? what if you need to do a capital call and the investors say no. What if the deal goes South, how will everyone be protected. Is all this capital going to over leverage the deal?<br><br>The risk you take is that a funder that will be in first position will ask where is the sponsor-operators equity going to come from? a lender may say that if the sponsor-operator uses funds from a capital raise, that those monies are not equity from their own resources.<br><br>If I were structuring this, I would do a complete capital raise for the entire investment and create a joint venture structure where the equity investors get their money back plus a negotiated % of profits or ROI and the principal sponsor-operator gets the income plus tax benefits.<br><br>        </p>

          To the above intermediary.  I agree with what your saying.  If I&#39;m not mistaken having debt along with equity doesn&#39;t stop the equity holder from enacting remedies for non-performance as well as rewarding the sponsor for exceptional performance; there will be hurdles which have to be met.  Like Sal said this is knowledge of the lawyers, so they will be more versed in protecting the equity and the project.<br><br>For Sal, I guess at times I get stuck in analysis paralysis.  Ever since I heard you use the term &quot;Structure away the risk&quot;,  it is something that I have tattooed in the way I think.  And no, I&#39;m not putting together docs or papering deals; I&#39;m just hashing out talking point - sort of like and LOI.  Something like a verbal agreement before I bring it to you guys; basically setting expectations...(is this something you could help me with)?        </p>

          That is fine. You need to have these discussions *before* you speak to the attorneys. Otherwise they will charge you for “discovery”. Meaning, you’re paying to be the R&amp;D department on your own deal! <br><br>Structure the verbal agreement, place it here, and I’ll make changes as needed. <br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          Hurol,<br>I like the concept of offering 100% financing, not too many are doing this today. Let&#39;s look at the capital raise for a moment. Your asking investors to place funds in the deal and yes I agree, with the right docs drafted by the right attorneys, the investors can be protected and at the end of the day, that&#39;s where you need to place your concern.<br><br>Now if I&#39;m an investor and your pitching me on this deal, the first thing I&#39;m going to ask is how much skin in the game are the sponsor operators putting in. Why am I asking this? Two reasons.<br><br>1) Because I&#39;m looking to limit my exposure 2) I&#39;m looking for a reason (s) to say no. I&#39;m looking at the risks. Investors are always looking at the risks first, the rewards second because just one risk proving out can dilute my entire investment.<br><br>Next, I&#39;m going to ask, what happens if the sponsor operator causes the property to end up in foreclosure, am I going to have to get into a capital call just to save the property from foreclosure and protect my interest.<br><br>Next concern is how am I going to feel about sharing the stage with a lender? In a foreclosure action, most lenders will escalate the interest on the loan to the highest rate allowed by law, so if the loan starts out at 10% and the need to escalate comes about and the maximum in your state is 21%, were all in trouble. The lender isn&#39;t going to care about the investors.<br><br>Next I&#39;m going to focus upon you. Your setting up all of this. What experience do you have in this? do you understand what fiduciary duty really entails, how are you being compensated. You mentioned the concept of who has the gold calls the shots, well unfortunately, its the investors with the gold, so they will probably call the shots.<br><br>Like I said, I like it however, I would structure this as a joint venture, saying to the sponsor operator, you line up the funding first and my fund will invest the remainder. Your fund will be one you create and manage.<br><br>I know I sound like a james downer, I&#39;ve learned to think like this because this is how Sal has conditioned me to think.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have been working for about a month now with a very experienced buying entity out of Newport Beach, California that has been buying seconds from banks for about seven years now. I think I mentioned them in another post.<br><br>I was thinking about presenting the idea of a credit facility to them through Dandrew. Would this be of interest to Dandrew? they want to do business by selling to us the seconds they choose to sell each month. <br><br>I&#39;m thinking a credit facility would be of great interest to them.        </p>

          James<br><br>Not for seconds. No. Nobody wants to provide debt (or equity) in this space as they are too small (in aggregate volume size) and remedying these can be expensive. <br><br>The collateral is dubious too. These are more like buying credit card paper and if they have been worked over before, chances are the buyer isn&#39;t going to pay. So what you&#39;re getting essentially has been picked through before by larger players. <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br>This gives me a idea. This idea could be a profit center in itself. The wheels are turning. Let me put this out there, please give me your thoughts.<br><br>How about creating a credit facility program/product available to those loan pool and bulk asset/bulk REO traders who are experienced, where they have two options. Option 1) Buy and hold for their own portfolio and pay Dandrew a predetermined monthly payment on each note on the credit line,  but they have to buy in bulk, so in essence, if they used their line to buy 50 notes, even though they are buying in bulk, they are paying on a per note basis. Option 2) Dandrew makes a equity investment and  I&#39;m taking this idea from the 40K Flips webinar, they either pay a Dandrew 15% profit or 12% per month until they retire the notes.<br><br>The risk is that they won&#39;t repay Dandrew because a note or notes go bad, so Dandrew files a UCC-1 and has a interest in each note or pool of notes or property, this way if it goes bad, Dandrew can recover the assets and facilitate a sale, thus recovering their monies.<br><br>This is Equity Sharing on steroids.         </p>

          James<br><br>You&#39;ve come a long way since before you became a Private Equiteer. Now you&#39;re thinking about what can go wrong and how to *structure the risk* away from your investors. I like that. <br><br>I think an 70/30 split after a 12% pref (or IRR look back) is what the market is clocking in at. <br><br>That is what Gordon and I are around for similar JV facilities for NPNs. <br><br>Remember, equity is not debt. <br><br>Credit is debt. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I have a multifamily portfolio deal in Dallas -Houston, TX, that pass all our Pre-qualification questions (e.g. skin in the game, NOI can service the debt, 91%  occupancy, sponsor experience, etc.), but the loan amount required is $314,000,000. Since the loan amount is huge, I have advised the sponsor to try breaking down the portfolio in groups of buildings, so there would be several loans.  To further assist the sponsor, I need to know:<br>1.  What would be the max loan amount Dandrew would provide? This would help us grouping the assets, to fit Dandrew’s criteria).<br>2. Is Dandrew-Sal interested in a JV? <br>Thank you<br>        </p>

          Fulga:<br><br>We need to clarify a few things: <br><br>1.  That pass all *our* Pre-qualification.<br>Who is “our”? Fulga’s or Dandrew’s pre-qualifications? I’m only interested in the 5 Data Points for each asset at first. Nothing more. <br><br>2.  What is his experience managing this asset class? Did you ask for a Deal Sheet from him? <br><br>3.  Where are these assets coming from? Are you direct to the seller, who I imagine should be a lender or a large REIT? <br><br>4.  How long have they been looking for capital for this deal? <br><br>5.  Do you have – on an Excel spreadsheet – the assets that are included into this big trade? <br><br>If the numbers and experience add up, anything is possible. Right now these larger deals don’t usually flow downstream to the students as they are picked up by larger firms who have a lower cost of capital. Which makes me wonder about why they are coming to you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Wow, that is a hefty number, what I am wondering is after several firms co fund this thing, will there be any meat left on the bone and just how much the monthly debt service payments are going to be at that price.<br><br>Fulga I would pay real close attention to the sources and uses statements, do they align with the story of the deal? Also let me tell you about how multi family works in Dallas.<br><br>You have South Dallas, North Dallas, Dallas, Uptown Dallas, and Oak Lawn. Dallas is comprised of 22 independent cities within Dallas County and each is a market of their own, with market conditions that all differ.<br><br>The areas I mentioned above are where all the multi family properties are in The city of Dallas.<br><br>South Dallas is an area that is not highly desirable based upon the market. Rents are somewhere around section 8 levels and can drop to a low of $300.00. This area is a war zone on steroids and there is at this time, zero upside to owning there. No one is coming in and investing any new money into infrastructure.<br><br>The other areas are more desirable and some properties can command rents of $2000.00 plus per month. My guess is that the collateral for this loan is going to have to be somewhere between $800 and $1200 per month or better to make debt stack payments.<br><br>The thing that makes Dallas attractive for the non-wealthy is that Texas in itself as well as Dallas and Houston us that us what us called debtors heaven. This means that those who have screwed up financially can move here and literally start over.<br><br>You can buy a car with no credit to severely damaged credit, can lease purchase a home even if you&#39;ve never paid a bill a day in your life for about $750.00 up front.<br><br>No one cares about people&#39;s pasts it seems. Very bad business practices.        </p>

          Sal, I am happy to find out that we can go so high in loan value with you, so I will get the answers to your questions. Regarding why somebody would come to Fulga with such a huge project, my answer is: Maybe I am doing something right. <br><br>I have also a request for a $1.7 Billion loan, where a group of investors would purchase a chain of high rated restaurants across US; I did not believe it first, so I requested all kind of documents, and I’ve received all the proof needed that they were serious about it (hundreds of legal pages). I’ve spent hours over the phone with the main sponsor to find out details about the deal, and we even talked about structuring scenarios. <br> <br>…so YES Sal, we are getting loans requests for huge amount of money, but I did not take them seriously, until now. <br>I have also on my desk loans requests for more than $50 mill each: 9 JVs, 8 development projects, and 2 multifamily purchases in London. <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have been working with a young man who is getting his MBA from Souther Methodist University. He is starting in the business and I&#39;m teaching him about loan pools and bulk assets.<br><br>He echoed your thoughts but took it a bit further. He suggested doing a call with the whole loan trader at this Hedge Fund and ask for a tape of what they have available. Upon securing this, let him model it against Dandrew&#39;s spreadsheet to ensure we have all the key data needed.<br><br>He made a very good point when he just saw your talk us cheap comment. His point is that if this really is an active Hedge Fund trading in these assets, they will understand what a fund like Dandrew will want to see. They won&#39;t be playing games with us.<br><br>Once everything we need is secured, submit it to you for purchase. Once submitted, then work to setup a conduit type relationship where they will give us first right of refusal on all subsequent deals and push to create a flow basis.<br><br>He also suggested saying to them, if your turning product every 60 days because your creating a huge tape, why not just break it in half and trade every 30 days and keep your funds investors monies working every 30 instead if every 60.        </p>

          James<br><br>Exactly. This is called a “bulk flow basis”. He is absolutely right. Have him call the funds to see if they want to “clear balance sheet” or at least having us “hang a number” on what they have. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>He called and they are going to setup a exploratory call for tomorrow morning, with him and I. This could be very promising and I like it because it&#39;s a fund and we get to talk adult stuff with no hand holding. I will update you after the call, looking to secure a tape tomorrow immediately after the call.<br><br>We will impress upon them that we want to buy if they want to sell and we can make a play.        </p>

          Never at par and certainly not at par plus. That&#39;s like buying a slightly used Mercedes that you really want and paying new car prices. Anyone reading this, never, never, never pay retail, you can&#39;t make money that way and neither can your capital provider.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to pass this on for the benefit of those who are new and trying to navigate through the Bulk asset and Loan Pool segment of the business and may not be able to submit those types if deals to Dandrew.<br><br>I had a broker tell me today that he gets five points on every deal he does. I said that&#39;s fine, who&#39;s paying you that and where do I sign up at. He grew silent for a moment and said what does that mean.<br><br>I said let&#39;s rephrase that, five points that&#39;s fine, who&#39;s paying you. He said oh, well you are and I said nah, do to think so, he said isn&#39;t that customary?<br><br>Ok, look at his reply again? Clearly he bought some course written by some idiot. He didn&#39;t even know the game he is trying to play in. Don&#39;t let this happen to you.<br><br>When Sal says we will meet all types in this business, mainly those who are clueless, he is not kidding. So with that said, save yourself a lot of heart ache moving forward.<br><br>Someone says POF and LOI to see the deal, best reply is Proof of being a fool and Letter of intent? Not happening. Someone says  sign my NCND, run the other way.<br><br>Someone says sign my NDA, realize your probably dealing with a direct source and look to leverage your intellectual capital into a deal.<br><br>If someone says I&#39;m direct to the seller, ask this question...If I get on the phone with the seller are they going to tell me the same thing?<br><br>These are just a few things I&#39;ve come to learn a long time ago.        </p>

          Dexter, years ago when I started in the business I was brokering notes. Back then the in thing was trading individual notes. Pools were for the big boys, I.e selling entity to the bigger Wall Street type buyers with deep pockets who understood the matrix on pools.<br><br>I often worked with builders, mainly the smaller guys who did not always have the liquidity needed to secure development financing. Liquidity is a banking term that means having cash reserves on hand.<br><br>How I structured deals was as follows. I setup a relationship with note buyers ahead of time. This was easy because I was in their eyes a shop that would always have product available. I was going to bring about opportunities for them to make money, I wasn&#39;t a once in awhile deal source. <br><br>In the loan pool business and note business today, this is referred to as flow basis. This is what everyone wants. Once and dones are great but flow is where it is at.<br><br>Builders were easy to get on board because what I was doing was increasing their market because they would simply advertise, &quot;We offer Builder financing&quot;. This gave the builder a whole new market niche, because not many were offering this and it bought people in on Saturdays on a regular basis.<br><br>The deals were structured as follows. 65/20/15. This meant Builder would create a first lien mortgage for 65%, a second mortgage for 20% and buyer had to come to the table with 15% down. <br><br>The note buyer would run credit, qualify the deal and say yes or no. If it was a go, the title agent would create the docs and setup and administer the closing. The actual down was 10% but we added back in the anticipated 5% discount the builder would have had to take.<br><br>I generated a commission of $500.00 per closed deal. When your a twenty something kid and your making $500.00 a deal, it&#39;s huge. If I did 5 per month, that was $2500.00 and back then that&#39;s like making $10,000 per month today.<br><br>Now the note buyer would buy the first, the builder would hold the second for income. The note servicer would collect both payments and simply mail back to the builder his payment, minus fees.<br><br>Now why would a buyer do this deal? the reason is that they couldn&#39;t buy a new home any other way and the two payments were not much more than what they would pay a bank anyway.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a deal coming across this weekend and I&#39;ve already been informed already about what asset classes comprise this portfolio of bulk properties.<br><br>Here&#39;s the story. Wealthy Jewish businessman going back to Tel Aviv, buying into technology company. Wants to liquidate all his properties. <br><br>There is a mix of SFR, Commercial, Multi Family. He is looking for .38 cents on the dollar. We cannot carve out, it&#39;s an all in. This is a total divestiture of a portfolio. <br><br>Here&#39;s where my question comes out of. There is land mixed in, zoned for commercial. My question is, if it&#39;s a portfolio you&#39;d want to acquire, on a situation like this, would you take the land to get everything else that can be immediately used?        </p>

If they are in Detroit, don’t waste your time. <br><br>The bids on these are prepared as follows: <br><br>1. *“All In Bid*.<br>This is the total bid for the pool. IN your case, 38%. But 38% of what? Value? BPO? Are these loans? <br><br>2. *“Asset-Level Bid”*<br>This is an *“individual bid”* where we “hang a number” on *each asset*. So if we were to look at this, the land would probably be discounted to zero bid. Yes, I know it’s zoned, but as you have seen in Land Development Financier™ only 5% in the industry actually know what “zoned” means as a function of value and how prices are discovered. <br><br>So I would be interested to look at this and perhaps we *could* cross a trade with someone else. But if the assets are crap, then no dice. <br><br>Sal <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have two Ohio deals for portfolios of SFR&#39;s to submit tonight. My question is this. Since Canton Ohio is not a Tier 1 city, is this a market you&#39;d consider making a play in? The first portfolio is 68 SFR&#39;s, all tenanted and seller is flexible. I got this directly from the owners of the assets and they just sent me the second deal that I&#39;m going to review.<br><br>As always, I&#39;m working g through the night. I can sleep when my bank balance is at a very high 7 figures, until then it&#39;s chase the deal, chase the compensation but above all else, build a relationship.        </p>

          James<br><br>I don&#39;t sleep either. <br><br>Here is my question.

          Re:Re:Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>You stated that: “The main issue why this is a pass is because one of the main tenants leases expire in 2015”….so let me rephrase what it has been said about this tenant: “Siemens Electronics: Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement; Gross Income = $389,389”<br><br>So the lease will be renewed.  Would a new lease change your mind or there it will be something else? <br>Also, please explain why you don’t consider the cross-collateral as a very strong decision maker.  You can easily sell the shares and recover the capital if things go sour. The cross-collateral is practically yours.  I really need to better understand your reasoning. <br>I greatly appreciate your time and feedback on this deal, but as deals start flowing in my office, it’s important to understand the specifics on why deals won’t pass.

          Fulga<br><br>So we’re back to the question. Will Siemens Electronics renew after 2015? Are they “pregnant” or not? If so, have the renewed formally and how long is the lease term? What&#39;s changed in the past 24 hours since I believe you stated they weren&#39;t going to renew? This is something that doesn&#39;t happen overnight. It happens over a protracted period of negotiations. <br><br>(And any new &quot;news&quot; will spook investors like us and is a reason why we put these deals on ice for a period of time for the truth to come out...)<br><br>I think cross collateral is great, but if I’m promising an investor a coupon each month, it doesn’t make sense for any lender to make a loan against something – albeit cross collateralized – that will lose value in less than 9 months because a major tenant is moving out.<br><br>Cross collateralization is not a *reason* to make a loan itself, but rather an extra comfort that your over secured should anything go bad. Its also an excuse for a Federal Bankruptcy Judge to nullify the cross-collateralization clause as it can been seen as being &quot;predatory&quot; in some states because we made a loan that was cross collateralized knowing that a) the tenant was moving out and, b) as a result, they didn&#39;t have income to make the debt payments, and c) we foreclosed on the collateral. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Fulga, I am enjoying reading this, however, I am confused, do you want this to be funded or not??? As I told you on our call, you need to have additional capital providers. The number one reason capital providers got into trouble back a few years ago was by just simply writing checks for investments that were not worthy of funding.<br><br>Sal has said its a pass, he has stated that here and you acknowledged it as such. He gave you his reasons and right now at this point, I fail to see why you simply do not look elsewhere for funding.<br><br>At this point from my view and I&#39;m going to say the view of others here that your trying to call Sal to the mat and make him look bad. Sal has said in the past that 1) he is not obligated to fund any intermediaries deal just because they spend money with him and 2) he will not be strong armed into funding anyone&#39;s deal.        </p>

          I don&#39;t think Fulga or anyone wants to make Sal look bad.  We are all grateful for his expert training.  We simply want to understand our deals and what makes them a good or bad candidate for his  capital investment.  We all want and need deals to go through.  You bring up a good point ...is it Jim? Capital consulting team.  How can we make the deal work by getting other capital providers to spread the risk or is it just a bad deal?  That is all we want to know. Why it is a bad deal and or what we can do to make it better or to work?        </p>

          Thank you Sal.  Happily I do understand what you are saying.  It has taken some time but I think I am getting it.  Your capital providers are guaranteed a coupon, income check, on a monthly basis and you can&#39;t provide that if the value is depleted due to a vacancy.  We don&#39;t go by a promise of a renewal.  Only a signed agreement will do. (pregnant test positive)         </p>

          Molly, I appreciate your feed back. I understand members wanting to understand the why and why not. I also understand wanting to know why a deal gets passed on. Were all here to learn.<br><br>However, when someone turns a post into something personal and uses strong words like &quot; I don&#39;t get you Sal&quot;, that&#39;s when I feel like I do and why I came across the way I did.<br><br>I think AskDandrew is a great forum for learning not only from Sal but one another. I value everyone here as a professional.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I will not be on the call today. I&#39;ve got a call with the banker and his admin and the CFO for the bank to get things rolling, and it conflicts with today&#39;s call with Dandrew. I&#39;m investing a lot of time with these guys because were building a relationship.<br><br>I wanted to put out something on here and I was going to actually do a live *6 comment. Here goes.<br><br>Gals and guys<br><br>Sal is not going to fund every deal that any of us at any level submit, it&#39;s that simple. Sal and AJ have posted the new programs and that is what they are going to fund outside of bulk REO/asset deals and loan pools. <br><br>Sal has made it clear he will not fund a deal just because we spend money with him and Dandrew and he will not be strong armed into funding a deal.<br><br>Sal and Dandrew operate funds, this us what institutional based hedge funds do. Each fund has specific goals and initiatives and submitted deals must fit into that. If it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s a pass, very simple.<br><br>This is why you must, must, must have relationships with other capital providers. This is just simply prudent business. When Sal says pass, it&#39;s for reasons that he makes evident.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to comment on the value of what those here receive from their connection with you. I have said it before, I am not a spokesman paid or otherwise for Dandrew. I am a member here like others are.<br><br>I don&#39;t know about the contents of every program Sal has created however the one thing I do know is that the materials are not just for use with putting deals together to ship over to Sal and Dandrew. <br><br>I can tell you with certainty that if it were not for what I&#39;ve learned from Sal and Dandrew, I wouldn&#39;t have got my foot in the door at several very large capital providers outside of Dandrew.<br><br>Do I use other providers? I do and not because I want to be less than loyal to Sal, but the main reasons are 1) it&#39;s a prudent business practice 2) Sal and Dandrew don&#39;t fund every type of deal 3) I&#39;m in business to solve problems and make money.<br><br>Okay then how do you leverage yourself into other capital providers trade desks? By using your intellectual capital. If you have an understanding of the dynamics of a variety of transaction types, you will impress others and be invited to the party, because the person or entity inviting you, has confidence in the fact they are dealing with a worthy professional.<br><br>Sal once said to me that more people never submit deals than those that do and they pay for the right to do something but choose to do nothing. This is the you can walk a horse to water but can&#39;t make it drink syndrome.<br><br>My guess is people tried and failed and quit. What generally happens to those is that the very next deal would have closed. If you quit, what are you going to do then?<br><br>Most business opportunities that are advertised only make one person rich, the one selling you the opportunity that never worked for them. Most people who own small businesses remain small because they don&#39;t have the performance matrix for success that they want others to believe.<br><br>If someone has a successful business, do you really believe they are going to put it together in some Ebook and sell it to the public for $29.95?<br><br>You can choose to work or quit, it&#39;s that simple. There are billions of dollars in transactions available all over the US, do you believe that there are enough financial houses to close this business?        </p>

          Fulga, there are some very creative things that can be done here. The best strategy is to place the three free and clear properties into a LLC and refinance the properties with the new LLC assuming the debt, using income from all three to pay the debt.<br><br>Use the refinance proceeds to pay off the one property and sell it to the new LLC. The new LLC now has increased value and then sell off each space in the foreclosed property to the tenants. Owning is always more attractive than leasing.<br><br>Use the sale proceeds to retire all the debt and the LLC has increased it&#39;s value a lot.        </p>

          Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>As stated in my Comment Post, I did not post this deal with the purpose to be approved, but rather to better understand your position on situations where there is an asset that is purchased at 30% below market value, request for financing is 100% and there is cross-collateral owned free and clear that could be easily sold to recover the capital. There are great discussion points that we could all benefit from, so let’s start by answering your questions the best I can:<br><br>1.  Your sponsor is asking for 100% of the Purchase Price. They just merely increased or had the appraisal clock in at a level that would make it look like it would be financed at 70%. This is why we ask for the 5 Data Points as we can see through the deal clearly.<br>Answer: If I understand your response correctly, we should be skeptical of deals where the sponsor does not have “skin in the game”, even if there is an appraisal report showing more than 25% equity, and there is solid cross-collateral. So far 50% our sponsors request capital for assets purchased at a discount with equity higher than 25%, and present to us appraisal reports to confirm the equity. I know the answer to this is:  “it depends” on the deal…market tier, class asset, sponsor experience, etc… My take on this is that the Exit Strategy is a good decision factor on deals like this. If one can easily recover the capital with minimum risk, than the deal merits further consideration in my opinion. When I see “Refinancing” as an Exit Strategy, I am skeptical because we all know how expensive and painful the foreclosure process is. As an investor, I like deals where I can get the Deed of a cross- collateral asset that I could sell fast and recover my capital in case the sponsor defaults…but this is just me! This sponsor has 3 assets owned free and clear in NY and FL as a cross-collateral, and that’s the main reason I presented this deal for discussion.  <br><br>I know we should be skeptical about an appraisal value provided by sponsor, however, the validity of the value is always confirmed as part of the “due diligence” as the expense of the sponsor.  <br><br>To conclude this, please elaborate further so we could all learn: How should we approach deals where a sponsor requests 100% financing when they are buying back their property/note from the bank at a 25% and up discount? They provide an Appraisal report from a credible company proving the fair market value. Shall we say “No”, upfront even if there is cross-collateral? Shall we consider other factors as tier market, class asset, etc. in addition to cross-collateral? <br><br>2.  Regarding “Where are the 5 data points? It seems as though you broke a few rules here and did it the “Fulga Way”, <br>Answer: Sorry if you feel that I broke the rules, because the 5 data points were presented in the narrative as follows: <br><br>1.  Current NOI: $468,000<br>2.  Proforma NOI: No Idea (it was really stupid for me to say that: I should have stated in a different way; good point to beat on me! On my defense, this was a deal for discussion, not for approval. Anyway, the Infographic states that Pro forma is a “TYPICALLY a COMPLETE LIE”, but I really understand its merit. <br>3.  Debt stack: $7,800,000 (so there is no overleverage) <br>4.  Sources and Uses: Purchase<br>5.  Exit Strategy: Refinancing and contingency as Cross-collateralization <br><br>3.  As you know, REOs don’t have any loans, so when you mention 2 loans can be combined confuses me.<br>Answer: As stated in my Comment, the sponsor would like to get an additional loan, if possible. Since there are 3 assets as cross- collateral, we could “refinance” one of them, and the sponsor would use the money to add value to the subject property. This was very appealing to me that made the deal stronger.<br><br>4.  Regarding the tenant: “Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement.” This is the equivalent of asking a woman if she is pregnant or not: Has it been renewed or not? That is a very critical part of this. Only 2 answers will suffice. If they didn’t renew, that will break the deal.<br>Answer: Lessons learned: We should have just stated: Lease Expires in 2015, without including that there is an agreement for renewal…or present fact for the Lease Renewal. Good point!<br><br>We are at the beginning of this journey with you, and as you stated so often in your videos, one needs to date before marrying ...so we are in the dating period to better understand the deals that should NOT be submitted. We receive many deals where the 5 points look pretty good, but instead of submitting the deal immediately, we are digging further, and we see issues that surface.  Honestly, I understand why many deals submitted with the 5 data points get rejected. I think that additional points should be added to pre-qualify a deal…that would make the process more efficient….but again…I just started this business and have a lot to learn. <br><br>Thank you for your help.        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I understand what you are talking about here. Let’s remember a few things, and I have to continue to remind myself that I’m dealing with a highly-educated engineer here, so we can communicate correctly. You like the facts, or what someone tells you are “facts”. More on that in a moment.<br> <br>1. We created the 5 Data Points as a *pre-qualification only* to see if we should have a “second date”. More info from this is adding too many ingredients to the soup and can spoil (or fool) the Intermediary easily who is newer. <br><br>2. My answers are to train you and everyone to *think critically about deals*.<br><br>My old boss at GS once told me “always assume the guy on the other side of the trade is looking to [fool] you”. <br>The fact that they want 100% of purchase price is OK, *but it’s the basis we don’t know*. Appraisals are not taken seriously by anyone. <br><br>So what do we do? We look at the a) *UPB* (Unpaid Principal Balance) and, b) *price-per-pound*, or what similar assets have traded at. (The subscription website you showed me would give you this very important info, by the way!). That will tell us if we’re really getting in at a good basis or not. <br><br>Don’t get me wrong, we’ve funded 100% of DPOs before and we’re fine with that so long as, among other things, we’re in at a *good basis*. <br><br>Put another way, if I had a 1 oz Gold Coin, we know that these are currently going for ~$1,400 an ounce that I could buy, I’m almost certain you would fund me at a purchase price (“basis”) at $400, $500, maybe even $900 using that gold as collateral. <br><br>But if I were to tell you I was buying this for $1200, you may not be so excited with the basis I’m getting this deal at and want me to put some fresh equity in. <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Fulga, I enjoyed our conversation today. However, let me say this. Even know my firm is not in the business of acquiring properties, I have bought some in the past. Sometimes, if a property is sold at 30 cents on the dollar it&#39;s because that&#39;s all it really is worth in today&#39;s quick sale dollars.<br><br>This is a strategy hard money lenders will use to determine what a property is worth to them Some hard money lenders understand an appraisal isn&#39;t worth the paper it&#39;s written on, so they will use quick sale value.<br><br>To those reading this and wonder what that term means, it means the following. If a property has a future value or after repair value of $100,000.00 and it&#39;s purchased for $45,000.00 or 45% of future value! then what can a hard money lender sell it for right now if they had to foreclose. <br><br>If you said $45,000.00 your incorrect because this is what was paid for it, not what it&#39;s actually worth. If you bought correctly because you knew what you were doing, you&#39;d have a property worth more than you paid, if your lacking knowledge, you&#39;d pay too much.<br><br>I have an idea how to structure this so it could be funded. Give a few minutes to digest this.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to just send something general about my experiences with Dandrew and yes I&#39;m going to raise my skirt a little. This us my third go around with Dandrew. The first two times I came in through the $1.00 offer and the first time my credit card declined and the girl in the office shut me out.<br><br>The second time, I was recovering from a truck/car accident and my compensation checks stopped and I missed a payment and I was shut out because of previous experiences.<br><br>They say the third time is a charm and that is a real understatement, Sal flat out said, I&#39;m going to give you another shot however know that you screw this up, your done for good. If we don&#39;t have a wall of shame well just throw your pic up on a wall, well no he didn&#39;t go that far but I could see it.<br><br>The things I am doing, that I write about come from Sal&#39;s teachings, which is what it&#39;s designed to do. Let&#39;s all be honest, Sal doesn&#39;t need to do this.<br><br>He doesn&#39;t need to work on a Sunday, creating products, infographics, taking time away from family, flying coast to coast to get back to Vegas after doing regular business stuff, to wake up and do this all over again.<br><br>Sal has said, they aren&#39;t getting rich off Dandrew Media. The revenues cover costs. Dandrew drives revenues from deals they do in the NYC offices and what we send them that gets funded.<br><br>I think i am safe in saying Sal wants us all to do the larger deals because this is what everything he is teaching is geared towards. Why would you want to do small deals? when you focus on small deals, your limiting your income potential. Also realize that small deals are nit always deals at all, so why spin your wheels.<br><br>Let&#39;s look at it another way. You want to be known as a major player in the business and you make contact with someone such as a real estate broker. You talk about credibility, what you can do for them, your a mover and a shaker and then you answer their question of so tell me what deals you&#39;ve done and you tell that person, well I did a $500,000.00 loan two months ago, and I consulted on a loan pool of 6 loans for $375,000.00.<br><br>What do you think that contact is thinking about you? Well if they are trying to scale their business and get to the $5,000,000.00 deal flow level, your not going to get them there and they will look elsewhere.<br><br>Most realtors and real estate brokers have 1 or 2 funders they refer business to on a regular basis, you will never be invited to the party if you don&#39;t begin marketing to the class of deal makers you have the tools at your disposal to work with.<br><br>Please know you don&#39;t have to transact business on Loop Net, you don&#39;t have to work with some small real estate brokerage that may have deals once a year.<br><br>You can call Marcus and Milichap, Re/Max Commercial, the NAI brokerages and confidently talk and be the gal/guy who walks the walk. <br><br>If you get your foot in the door at one of these large commercial real estate entities, you will see your business explode overnight. How do I arrive at this conclusion. Well, Marcus and Milichap currently has in excess of 10,000 commercial real estate brokers nationwide. Do you think there&#39;s a good chance of getting some deal flow? do you think your clients will be experienced sponsor operators? Is it entirely possible that they need capital because banks aren&#39;t funding but your capital provider Dandrew is. Do you think you&#39;ll be dealing with entities that will be doing more than one deal this year and will come back to you again on the next one?<br><br>If your dealing with loan pools, there are three key phrases I&#39;ve discovered that get ears perked up and I got these from Sal. They are Were Principal Bids, Were looking at Performing, NPN, Re-Performing and scratch and Dent and We are Direct to Buyer. <br><br>Were principal bids tells the banker that you are not shopping deals. Were looking at performing, non-performing, re-performing and scratch and dent tells the banker that your a problem solver and a single source deal house, meaning they don&#39;t have to deal with multiple buyers. Were direct to buyer tells the banker that you have access to the capital to buy from them.<br><br>Bankers are interested in one thing, can you get the deal done and if you understand what Sal has made available to you, you will be able to.<br><br>Being aligned with Sal and Dandrew has given me the confidence to be able to look at every deal and be able to talk to anyone in the business. I am thinking your on the same page.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am sitting here on a Sunday morning working, getting ready for tomorrows calls with several banks in the DFW area. I received a very interesting email that a broker forwarded to me by accident, I am certain because he lifted his skirt big time.<br><br>It was a email from a seller to him. I am posting the main part of it.<br><br>Dear  Steven,<br>This opportunity is going out to three brokers I have hand picked from prior experiences, your one of them. You have seventy two hours to submit your brokerages Letter of Interest and Proof of funds, to be used only in event you locate buyer, a contract for acquisition is consumated and the buyer does the eleventh hour bail out.<br><br>Please send via Fed EX, using Transaction Code 7712PNPNWestEastSouthwest. Thank you in advance.<br><br>This is a eye opener because it validates the point that brokers need buyers POF&#39;s to get into the party. I remember doing a real estate deal in Brooklyn, NY years ago that was where my partner was able to get into the deal by using my pof/bank statement. My partner locked up the deal with a thirty day option and $3,000.00 option consideration fee and his plan was to say to the seller that he was not able to go through with the purchase but has a partner who has indicated his willingness to do the deal and as good faith provided his pof.<br><br>For those here that are not investors right now but want to be, the above strategy is a very easy one to implement. You find a property and get it under contract.<br><br>You then begin marketing the property and once you have a solid buyer willing to do the deal, you have the buyer provide his/her POF along with an offer.<br><br>You go back to the seller and you say, I have a buyer who is going to partner with me. Since he/she will be the one arranging or providing funding, here is our POF.<br><br>You then simply assign your interest over to your partner after closing and walk away with your check.. Very real and very easy to do.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Wow the wheels are turning in the old idea chamber this morning. I got to thinking after I faxed off the deal stuff earlier and wanted to throw this out there for others.<br><br>There are tremendous opportunities to do big things in this business with the intellectual capital Sal and Dandrew have provided, if you just look around you.<br><br>Ever drive by an Apartment Building and said to your wife or husband, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to own that building? ever pass by a business that has a line out the door and thought to yourself, wow, who ever owns that is making a killing?<br><br>Ever go to your regular gas station and saw the owner and wondered where that guy got the money? well you can own pieces of properties and projects and businesses without borrowing, without having two nickels to rub together.<br><br>Your ticket to entry is your intellectual capital. Money has a value that in the right circles, multiples fast. To the untrained eye, a dollar buys a dollar worth of goods and services. To the trained eye, a dollar buys a lot of alot.<br><br>Some here are at the Private Equity level of Dandrew Intermediaries. Sure, we&#39;ve paid for this right and the return with regard to tools and education and know how is part of it and all at an advanced level.<br><br>For our investment, we learn the very powerful concept of Joint ventures along with other concepts and strategies. You learn about what is called a pitch book. This is a very good tool and it begins your path to getting into deals without money.<br><br>The majority of investors who have an idea and need to raise money through vehicles other than a loan have zero clue about a pitch book and more people know less about how to raise money than those in the know.<br><br>If you value a pitch book at $10,000.00 and you set your fees at $250.00 an hour on the low side to consult and help raise capital, that $250.00 adds up fast. Before you know it, you&#39;ve invested $25,000.00 to $50,000.00 worth of intellectual capital. <br><br>Now why not exchange that for ownership in an apartment buildling, thriving business, etc. Many big business ventures have been started and have grown to massive proportions out of one partner had the capital and the idea and the other had the know how to take all that and make the deal come alive and thrive.<br><br>Microsoft started this way. Does anyone believe Bill Gates had deep pockets when they started? Bill Gates had an idea and an opportunity to leverage a technology no one thought would work or was more than some guys idea pushed off to the side for another day. Paul Allen was the guy with the money and the brains to leverage his money with Bill Gates idea.<br><br>Intellectual capital is your ticket to the big time if you know how to leverage it.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been working on a few ideas and banking models, such as using the strategy/concept of equity sharing and co-mingling the concept with notes and pools. I will send that when it is done for your opinion.<br><br>I got to thinking about something this morning and wanted to pass this on. As anyone who has been here awhile knows or should know by now, Dandrew is not going to buy up every pool or portfolio submitted. <br><br>Because of the fact that Dandrew is really an institutional capital provider, it is really impossible to buy every deal and it&#39;s based upon the one very real and very key concept of certain pools and portfolios just do not fit into Dandrews clients investment plans.<br><br>Now does this mean that a pool is not a good deal or is a marginal opportunity at best? absolutely not. For those in sales, you understand the concept of a No is not a No, it really is a person saying, right now, this doesn&#39;t work for us.<br><br>So what do you do when Dandrew says no? well if your like most, you&#39;ll just send a email and say its a pass and see you on the next deal. Well you just left money on the table.<br><br>In real estate wholesaling, there is the concept of build a buyers list first, find out your buyers wants and needs and go out into the marketplace and find it. There is zero reason anyone here cannot do the same thing!!!<br><br>Okay so now your thinking wow, this is not easy to do, okay if I do it, if I give this a shot what do I do once I have a buyer? that is the fun part.<br><br>1. You build a profile on each buyer<br><br>2. You send them a partnership agreement that says your part is to source deals, qualify the deal to make sure you are dealing with someone who is direct or the seller themselves. Your doing this for deals your submitting to Dandrew and you&#39;ve already at this point had Dandrew say pass, so your not cheating on Sal. The buyers part is to provide the capital and the POF to do the deal.<br><br>3. You and the buyer close the deal and you work together to either sell the assets, hold for income, etc. You can get paid a portion of the monthly income, a consulting fee on the front end plus a share of profits, you can charge a consulting fee and a piece of the sale proceeds for each individual note or property. The compensation avenues are endless. You could agree to a consulting fee plus one property of your choice from the portfolio, hold that property for rental income or flip it and generate some money to start a retirement fund.<br><br>Why leave money on the table? what doesn&#39;t meet one buyers needs, could very well fit into the plans of another.        </p>

          Sal, AJ and AskDandrew members,<br>The other day I posted about a broker to stay away from. here is the update. I had to end up having a family mermber, who is a actual former FBI Agent send him a email along with a read request receipt. This gentleman immediately shut down his email and his phone goes direct to voice mail.<br><br>The email was as follows:<br><br>Dear Mr. Crawford,<br>You have had some recent dealings with the Principal and Managing Director for Structured Commercial Capital, James Balter. I have been asked to make contact with you and reiterate our firms policy with regard to the types of transactions we undertake and to address some additional key issues with you.<br><br>We are a firm that is deeply engrained in the commercial lending landscape as well as trading bulk assets and loan portfolio opportunities, on a national level platform.<br><br>In addition, we provide consulting services related to raising capital for opportunistic transactions as well as Private Equity for Commercial real estate opportunities, on a national level platform.<br><br>We do not engage in the acquisition of income producing commercial real estate properties, in any asset class. We are not clear as to how you came to the conclusion that we do openly engage in this area of real estate, to the point where you would attempt to solicit our investment/acquisition in two recent projects, a student housing property in New York City, NY as well as a Hyatt Hotel in Jacksonville, Florida.<br><br>While I did say we do not engage in the acquisition of properties, we will refer select opportunities to select individuals and entities that we have a relationship with who are investors.<br><br>After reviewing the opportunities you solicited our involvement with, it was determined that both properties were not for sale at the time you submitted the deals and that in fact, all principals in the transactions have no knowledge of who you are and never entered into an agreement with you on any level or in any capacity. <br><br>As Legal Counsel for the firm and a former FBI Special Agent in The Dallas Texas Office of The Bureau, I have determined that your actions are at the least hinged upon financial fraud as well as criminal in nature. You attempted to sell real property that you had no legal right to and that you have no controlling interest in. In addition, you utilized the internet to transact this business. Both of these activities are felonies in most US Jurisdictions.<br><br>I have referred this matter to The FBI in Dallas, New York City, NY, Jacksonville, Florida as well as The US Attorneys office, requesting immediate and swift legal action be instituted. I have also referred this matter to your local FBI office in Atlanta, Georgia for their review.<br><br>A Cease and decist order is being prepared and will be sent to the address we have on file for you. You are not to make contact with our firm or its Principals and employees moving forward.<br><br>Thank you, regards<br><br><br>It was after he received this email, he can no longer be located. I wanted to share this with everyone.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is an update. I spoke with the Bank President again this afternoon. I indicated that we will look at any and all, and here were the fine points I covered.<br><br>1. We like loans, we will look at any and all, however we are not shy about carving out, and that if they are asking for a all-in bid, we are going to looking for loans secured by assets that justify buying the entire portfolio.<br><br>They asked about Fades and I said that is something that could happen, it&#39;s based upon the deal, each strategy is deal specific.<br><br>2. The more information they can provide on the front end results in a smoother bid process and that we are principle bids.<br><br>They asked what we traditionally pay for firsts, seconds, P, NPN, RP and I said every loan is looked at, analyzed, we need to know the story of the deal so everything is deal specific. I then threw this out Sal...<br><br>When you made these loans, every loan decision was made based upon the merits and story of the borrower, the property, the financials, credit standing. You didn&#39;t simply just write a check, so we must be able to make determinations as well.<br><br>I then asked the question of, well how flexible are you going to be on a all-in deal where we may need to kick back some of the loans, are you willing to stand firm on a all-in strategy if allowing some carve outs to make a deal go and they said, we would have to look at the situation if we get there.<br><br>They asked for 7 days to look at what they have closely and see where they stand. I was very encouraged. I am posting this really as an update and to show that if you can become a problem solver while remaining firm, you can get things done.<br><br>Now is there a chance they will choose not to do business? Of course however, I have 57 more banks to call this week and next. I only need one to get some deal flow that can close and make money.<br><br>This was a real confidence builder today.        </p>

          James! Great job. Really appreciate your detail on the deals you are working on- or relationships- actually. I am calling banks as well and making some progress. Have not gotten the replies you have gotten but still have had presidents of banks asking for me to send over an e-mail to let them know what we do and to keep the lines of communication open. Again- thanks for sharing- we can call you- a &quot; mini Sal&quot; lol!        </p>

          Rich,<br>One of the constants I have heard from Sal and learned from is be concise but thorough. I follow the who, what, when, why and how formula when I either speak with someone or email them.. I try to always use the key phrases of does this make sense and I shut up and wait for a reply and that is deal speciific.<br><br>I try not to talk terms because another thing I learned from Sal as well as the time Ive been in the business, once you begin talking terms, the person your speaking with begins to hear what they want to hear, then it&#39;s well you said you pay this or you charge this and if Sal is the capital provider, then your putting him at a pricing disadvantage.<br><br>I have found that bankers talk the talk and walk the I control the deal walk. Its our job to explain to them and show them how in reality, we control the deal.<br><br>As Sal said on The Bulk REO Live program on Day 1, either they want it or they don&#39;t. Its alot easier to approach these bankers when you think in these terms and convey it.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have seen several different tapes in the past week, all different deals, all different assets where some of the assets state FDIC Asset in the comments section.<br><br>Are these treated like any other asset on the tape or are they carved out because they were possibly acquired at an auction where the seller of the pool may not have had the benefit of proper due diligence, modeling of the pool to make the best bid for the pool and priced themselves out of there being any remaining value for that particular asset?        </p>

          Sal,<br>What becomes your strategy and/or  pricing strategy if you receive a pool and two days later a loan needs to be pulled back from the pool by the seller for any number of reasons and you have already provided a bid?        </p>

          James. <br><br>This is something there is no answer for regarding pricing. Every asset is unique and most is contingent upon market prices and time and expense to foreclose on these assets. Those are the drivers for pricing. <br><br>People that want access to the bi-monthly heatmap and pricing model can go here:    <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniett     <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal, AJ and The Dandrew Intermediaries... <br>Good morning everyone. Last night I was given the blessing from both Sal and AJ to post this. I apologize in advance, if this is long winded.<br><br>I do not as a standard policy to bad mouth anyone in our business, whether it&#39;s a broker, intermediary, capital provider, etc. I do not like it or those that engage in it, however, there comes a point in time when someone&#39;s business practices are so wrong that they affect others and can continue to.<br><br>For the past month or so, I&#39;ve been approached by a broker who goes by the name of Marco Crawford. While I cannot speak to others experience with this broker, I can speak to my own.<br><br>He begun by attempting to make trades in Bulk REO and Loan Portfolio deals. I replied to one of his posts because he had what seemed like a good deal. He wasn&#39;t doing the usual send LOI and POF so I responded and asked for the tape and his reply was send LOI and POF. I politely explained we just do not engage in that practice.<br><br>Fast forward a few weeks and I begun receiving deal after deal or I should restate that, opportunity after opportunity. This is now when I began being concerned.<br><br>He attempted to sell a Student Housing property. I have a banker from Dubai that likes these so I emailed a brief overview and two days later received the following by email,<br><br>&quot;Mr. James, I am suspect on this transaction. I spoke with the University in NYC US who says they do not own this property and know nothing about sale. Please advise further my trusted Texan friend.&quot;<br><br>I called Pace University who informed me that they were in a long term master lease and gave me the owners contact information. I called the contact who said the building had been for sale prior to getting Pace University to commit to a very long term guaranteed lease and the property has not been for sale for a long time. I asked the price and they would not disclose it as I knew they would not.<br><br>Marco Crawford was asking $103,000,000.00 and stated my commission is 3%. I contacted him and asked if he is licensed to sell real estate in New York and he replied, he doesn&#39;t sell real estate. <br><br>Recently he sent me a opportunity to acquire a flagged hotel in Jacksonville, Florida for $20,000,000.00. I called the Relevant parties and no one knows this guy. I emailed back this broker, said were interested and asked what his commission would be and he said don&#39;t know. <br><br>It was last night that I saw a email from him, demanding to know where the offer on the Jacksonville Hotel is. I wrote back with this reply... &quot;We are looking at this, we will make an offer if and when we are ready, if it sells it sells&quot; his reply back was Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.<br><br>It is my understanding that Crepig has banned this broker from posting deals because they felt his business practices were a violation of their policies.<br><br>At that point, I decided to formally ask he not send me anymore deals and his reply was &quot;good you didn&#39;t do s--- anyway.<br><br>At the urging of my wife, she said email Sal and let him know what&#39;s going on because at some point in time, and it&#39;s enevitable, this broker will cross paths with other Dandrew Intermediaries and everyone in the field needs to know what they could face.<br><br>Sal and AJ gave me the blessing to post this. Please know once more, it is not my practice to discuss other brokers or judge them for trying to make money through every opportunity to do so, however, this goes above and beyond legitimate business practices.<br><br>Thank you for your time today.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I won&#39;t post the entire email reply I received today from a bank president post phone call from last week. I found this bank using the FDIC infographic.<br><br>James,<br>I enjoyed our discussion and you made some very good points. Your knowledge of our current position was spot on. When I started the bank I never could have envisioned we would be where we are at today.<br><br>Most phone calls I receive are from entities that have zero business calling in the first place. Your knowledge level is refreshing. Our board has a meeting this week, I believe on Wednesday. I will make it a point to determine what we want to dispose of .<br><br>Will you look at all or do you prefer all non-performing? Please advise on Tuesday. I will look for your call. One remaining question, are you looking to buy on a flow basis? we can turn inventory every thirty (30) until we clear our sheets.<br><br>I posted this to show that what you lay out on the infographic really does work. I received this reply by picking up a telephone and calling. Part if the reason he even spoke with me is because I am direct to the Buyer.        </p>

          Simple. <br><br>Private sellers aren’t as liquid and thus we have to provide what is called a *holdback* (as discussed in your training module) that will allow most of the proceeds to be released to the private seller, *but a portion that will be held back post-closing* for a pre-determined amount of time or until all agreed upon actions have been satisfactorily completed. <br><br>This could mean anything from getting rid of squatters to making sure that the first month’s payments have *all* arrived to the buyer’s offices or servicing company of the buyer’s choosing. <br><br>Or that all *Transfers and Assignments* have been recorded properly, so the buyer is now firmly in place on the chain of title. <br><br>It’s a “carrot and stick” incentive structure for Bulk REO and NPL trades. <br> <br>Sal        </p>

          Fulga, I would sell one of the parcels of land and use those funds to pay down the note. One big question that comes to mind is what are they doing to increase occupancy above 52%. What is their competitive advantage in the market above 52% of the market. <br><br>The project seems to be heading to overleverageville. Sometimes the answer to the problem is not in adding new capital to the capital stack in existence.<br><br>If they own the land outright, I would place both parcels into a separate LLC and syndicate the deal to two developers, and lend the proceeds to the other entity with a long term note with low interest payments that would be lower than taking on new capital.<br><br>Make the money that&#39;s readily available work for them.        </p>

          Sal,<br> I have been working on several deals over night. I wanted to post my email reply to a broker who just insists that I need to deal with them because they are the door to the seller. I think some of the new people could learn how to be firm from this.<br><br>&quot;I will sign a Confidentiality Agreement that is provided directly to my firm from the seller, however I will not sign a NCND/ NDA/Fee Agreement or any other document. The fact that you are asking me to sign your NCND indicates to me that you are not direct to the seller. Is that correct? I don&#39;t discuss deals with anyone other than the seller, period. I don&#39;t deal with sellers reps or brokers. I don&#39;t deal with anyone who is not in the ownership of the assets because there is simply nothing I need to discuss with you or anyone other than the decision maker.<br><br>It is our policy that we speak to the entity that has the legal authority to speak about the assets. During conversations, there is going to be sensitive information provided between buyer and seller entities and legally speaking, if you have not signed a confidentiality agreement with the seller as well as my firm, we are not able to enter into discussions.<br><br>If you are not the seller, I simply will not and can not entertain any business from you. Thank you.&quot;<br><br>This was provided to a broker who thought because they knew who the seller is and I don&#39;t that they were the person who was going to direct the deal.<br><br>There is the saying that the one who has the money leads the deal. I am the one direct to the capital provider and I am the one who controls the deal.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>As I sit here working late into the night or actually the morning, I started to read everything here and started to think how it is possible for new people to be viewing videos, thinking about questions and seeking answers and this is a good thing.<br><br>However, I personally feel that anyone who is new to Dandrew needs to be doing some additional things in addition. First thing is to figure out what you want to do with what you are learning. I know that sounds like a really stupid question but pragmatically speaking, it&#39;s a necessity, its a starting point.<br><br>Next, look at what you have in front of you, look at what this opportunity Sal has made available really encompasses. I don&#39;t care if your a banker level person or a private equity person, your opportunities are huge. How huge? lets take a look.<br><br>Banker level-This is the starting level but not the ending level. You could remain a Banker Level Intermediary for the rest of your life and became financially independent very fast. If you close one deal a month and make 2 points up front and those two points equal out to $50,000.00 or even $30,000.00, that is anywhere from $360,000.00 to $600,000.00 per year and that&#39;s just on points, this is not factoring in interest spreads or back end equity pieces.<br><br>Now I stated financially independent, I did not say wealthy or stinking filthy rich. Financially independent simply means writing your own paycheck, never having to punch a time clock, never having to worry about how you will support your family, unless of course you over leverage your lifestyle and that is possible to do, look at the personal bankruptcy court cases filed everyday in this country.<br><br>I won&#39;t delve into all the different levels of opportunities there are here, because this would be so long winded, and that&#39;s not my intention.<br><br>If you look at the big league players in the financial industry and really look closely at what they do and compare it to what you are able to do, provided you take action and go to work, you will see that there is a very close alignment of interests. This is in every opportunity and program Sal makes available.<br><br>The difference between them and you is absolutely zero. Many have MBA&#39;s however, you do to. Maybe it&#39;s not hanging on the wall, however, in terms of Intellectual Capital, you share the same knowledge base. If you look at commercial lenders websites who loan on the same property types as you can, they get their money from institutional investors and funds and simply lend it out. Where do you get your money from? Dandrew and who is Dandrew? a institutional investor/fund. See the alignment  of interests.<br><br>In closing, let me point out a distinction that will give you some motivation. Your competitors went to college and got a high profile degree and it cost them anywhere from $50,000.00 to $200,000.00 and from that educational journey, these very same financial professionals working on the street and within the industry, doing the very same things Sal and Dandrew have provided for $100.00 to $1500.00, are employees of a firm. You own the firm. They may have the title of Vice-President or President or Director of this or that, however at the end of the day, they are punching a time clock so to speak, and at the end of this year, the year after and the year after, they will still be employees. <br><br>This is how huge this is for you, for me, for everyone.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was on the entire call today and even sat through the Q and A until I had a client call coming in that I had to take. Great call, very informative as always.<br><br>I wanted to pass on something you said to me when we did a call a few months back about a fund idea. I took note of everything you told me, but this stood out.<br><br>I think those who are new need to understand something. You must know your deal and you must be passionate because you believe in the deal.<br><br>There are deals located that you just know will never fly and you don&#39;t get passionate about and then there are deals that will surface that you just know are worth doing.<br><br>A guy on the call today was not prepared to talk about a deal. I think we all saw how that went down. Sal and AJ were very nice when others would not have been.<br><br>All the spreadsheet templates, the five data points and other tools you have at your disposal are for the purpose of crafting the presentation to investors and funders for your deal. It all starts with the five data points and evolves from there.<br><br>The five data points gives you a birds eye view of the deal. What is the significance of the current NOI? well the debt service payments come out of this and it shows where the properties financials are. What  is the stabilized or Pro Forma? This is going to show where the project can be financially over time.<br><br>What&#39;s the debt stack? Will adding new capital cause the property to be over leveraged? In other words, will new capital put the property in danger of not making debt service. Sources and uses, the story behind the deal, exit strategy.<br><br>You must know this, it&#39;s a huge part of knowing the deal. One thing you also have to understand is what is the best deal structure? meaning, does the project lend itself to a refi? will bringing in a JV partner be more appropriate?<br><br>The guy on the call was talking about a multi family in Fort Worth, Texas, 186 units, 80% occupancy and he mentioned Loop Net, also known as hospice for deals. Just because it&#39;s 186 units and 80% occupied does not mean anyone will jump at this deal.<br><br>Most investors will compare a deal like this to others in the market. They will look at what&#39;s available for sale, what is the class of the asset, meaning is it A, B or C. The biggest question will always be, do I spend $2,000,000.00 for 186 units at 80% occupancy and a class C property that needs rehab, new management, new signage, extensive advertising and marketing to get occupancy raised or do I invest $2,850,000.00 for 240 units in a class A property where it&#39;s pretty much turn key.<br><br>You must ask yourself, if I had the capital available whether it&#39;s through a combination of my own or a partners equity and a new first or whatever the capital stack is, would I buy this deal? you have to look past dollars and cents because pragmatically, the deal just may not be worth doing.<br><br>Just my two cents Sal.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I noticed in the structured products and equity product posting today that there is Land listed as a asset type we can deal in.<br><br>Three questions. 1) do you have to be in a certain program to submit these deals. 2) are there any special details about land loans we need to be conscious of. 3) Does it matter whether the sponsor-operator wants to develop residential versus commercial or does it matter what the final asset class developed will be.        </p>

          Sal, <br>I just sent in an idea for a script when speaking with Hedge Funds. I wanted to re-phrase the idea. There will become a time when Dandrew Intermediaries come across a opportunity that is being made through a Hedge Fund.<br><br>A script that is specific to speaking with a Hedge Fund would be beneficial because Hedge Funds talk a language that is different than most.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on a call I had today. I spoke with a company that buys seconds from banks directly. They have been doing this full time since 2007.<br><br>They buy anywhere from 1000 to 10000 per month. Anything that does not fit into their portfolio, they will sell which is generally about 20 to 30% of the new inventory monthly. They work the files and hold in their own portfolio. They don&#39;t set junk aside and keep the best stuff, they simply liquidate what doesn&#39;t work for them.<br><br>They own the notes and they use a company in Virginia to house all the files and it&#39;s a fee for service situation with the holding house.<br><br>What I said to the CEO of the firm on the call is as follows:<br><br>We are backed by a large and successful fund that likes these types of opportunities and I am certain they would enjoy doing business over the long term. The pricing will be on a deal by deal basis. I have a follow up call on Monday of next week to fine tune the relationship.<br><br>They stated that they get opportunities to acquire first liens but since their entire business model focuses on seconds, they pass. I said we would have a interest in dealing with them on the firsts.<br><br>See you on the call.        </p>

          Sal, in reading some of the posts here, I&#39;ve come to see that a lot if the members are new and trying bulk deals. I applaud everyone for being here and working to make it big.<br><br>I wanted to pass this on as a few tricks I use to determine if I&#39;m dealing with a untrained Intermediary and determining if they are as direct as they want me to believe.<br><br>First question I ask is, so your direct to the seller? Usual answer is yes.<br><br>Next question is, who is the seller? Usual answer is can&#39;t provide that right now and my question us, why not<br><br>My statement than becomes, okay, well are they an individual, family office looking to divest, bank, usual answer is cannot provide that right now.<br><br>Next question is, when can you? Usual answer is always something like, when you submit a LOI and POF.<br><br>Next question is? Letter of interest or Letter of Intent. There is a difference. Letter of Interest just says you are interested and under what terms you usually buy at, it&#39;s very vanilla in nature. Letter of intent spells out what terms you&#39;ll buy at and what price you would buy at if everything meets your needs.<br><br>Next statement is, if your direct to the seller than you have a agreement for compensation in place and usually they say yes.<br><br>My next statement than becomes, well if this is the case than even if I went around you direct, you would be protected anyway no matter what, because if your direct and your the only one who has this deal, than the seller, who you have an agreement with knows I got the deal direct from you.<br><br>At this point, I usually have outed them and their only thing to cling to is a POF and I say well since we have already concluded you are not direct than I&#39;m not sending you a POF, I will send it to the seller at the proper stage, where do I send it to and usually this is when they confirm they are not direct because they can&#39;t tell you who the seller is, they only know who they got the deal from.<br><br>My next question is how many points are you getting in the deal and usually they say something like its 50 or 40 plus 3. I then call them out again by saying ok, what are you doing that&#39;s worth three points? Usually I get any myriad of replies.<br><br>I lead the call, I ask pointed questions, I listen to the replies, I listen to the tones in the other persons voice, I listen for tells, which is what professional poker players do when they are sizing up their co-players.<br><br>From the call I can tell if I am dealing with a novice or a seasoned player, a Intermediary or even a direct seller. Yes, sometimes you will get a seller who is great as a buyer but terrible as a seller.<br><br>You have to qualify the deal and you have to begin by qualifying the parties in the deal. You must know who your working with. Sorry this is long winded.        </p>

          Sal is my pal. Listen. Talking to this one guy-( not bank) swears he is the seller of these notes but wants POF and LOI ahead of time. Hate to keep bringing it up but this guy found my site and all. I told him we absolutely do not do LOI or POF before we even know what we are buying. He stated that they need this because they do not want all this information sent out like before when buyers who were not really buyers- shopped it around and all this non sense.<br><br>I said we will will sign  CA and that should suffice and we handle the info with respect and all. Left it at that. He swears he is the seller.<br>Standing my ground though. Not biting on this. The man with the money makes the rules. lol!!!<br><br>Banks will be calling me soon and I am following up with them as well as starting to call HML&#39;S. Love this stuff.<br><br>Thanks for all you and staff do! <br><br>        </p>

          Richard, I&#39;m dealing with this too just yesterday and I called this guy out. Here is what I did. I asked Letter of Interest or Letter of Intent, he said LOI, I said letter that I&#39;m interested or that I plan to buy. He said plan to buy.<br><br>I said sorry, don&#39;t issue that until I see what were looking at. I said ok so if I give this to you, then I can have the tape in less than 5 minutes right, he said, no we have to vet you. I said hmmm interesting. I&#39;m showing you I want to buy and I have the money and you want to vet me. I said if your direct or your the seller, you should have the tape right in front of you or in your files.<br><br>I played dumb and said well what&#39;s vetting, he said qualifying you. I said, I thought LOI and POF did that. I said look pal, I can call any bank in this country, ask if they have any loans they want to move off their balance sheet and have the tape in 24 to 48 hours or even in 5 minutes from the end of the call and I won&#39;t have to provide a POF up front and maybe just have to sign a NDA.<br><br>I told him your not dealing with an amateur here but I am. I wished him luck and said next call.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was going to email you about this deal, but I decided to post it here, because I really think this would be a good deal for others to learn from.<br><br>This is the Orlando, Florida deal I mentioned last week here. It is not a Bulk REO deal but rather a bulk property deal. Here is the breakdown of the numbers and specifics.<br><br>1) Portfolio consists of 43 Sfr&#39;s in Orlando, Sanford, Apopka, Daytona, Deland and Mount Dora. Property prices/values range between the $40k&#39;s and $166K. All professionally rehabbed.<br><br>2)  This is a all-deal no carve outs permitted. Seller ask is $3,100,000.00 but property prices are showing to be cumulative at $ 2, 673,000.00. Has received an offer at $2.7 M but I believe that to be a pricing tactic trick to generate an offer closer to ask. However, seller is flexible on offer.<br><br>3)  NOI is at $332,000.00 annually with the cap rate close to 11%. Monthly rents are below market at $27, 140.00.<br><br>4) Market rent is at $459,660.00 annually or $38,305.00 with a cap rate at market of 15% and allowing for a 5% vacancy.<br><br>The upside on this deal is that the rents are below market and once raised to market, will generate a monthly income increase of about $11,100.00. Orlando is a good market to be in and can be considered a Tier-1 City.<br><br>The properties have already been rehabbed professionally within last 12 to 36 months.<br><br>The downside to this deal is that the properties are not all at the $60K mini asset value. They are sfr&#39;s and produce 1 income stream as opposed to a multi family which has multiple income streams and if one tenant vacates, there is remaining income in place. The properties have already been rehabbed so from that perspective, there is no value add component so the value add would be in the immediate or near immediate increase of rents. <br><br>Is this a deal that Dandrew or Dave Gordon would have or share an interest in? Should I submit it? Any thoughts?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Great question. We&#39;re not (and no one I know of) is going to be a bid on this as there is a lot of *&quot;rougher product&quot;*, or *&quot;smaller balance&quot;* stuff on here that isn&#39;t desirable for institutions. <br><br>However, all is not lost though. At the event Dave Gordon will be talking about how to cross these with *individual retail investors*.<br><br>Individual rehab investors will buy these all day long. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          During the last Ask Dandrew call I briefly mentioned my idea of a new group which would be for those of us who have found someone who wants a specific type of property or if we have found something to sell.<br><br>I think that this could be another group just like the others in The Dandrew Community.  This way the information is located in one spot and not lost in all of the conversations and replies.<br><br>In the last AskDandrew Silver call Dave said David has a buyer for preforming loans and that if anyone had some that David should be contacted. Dave could not offer product at the yield the purchaser wanted.<br><br>I have found a private equity fund that buys sale-leaseback for single tenant office and warehouse.  They are also interested in larger medical groups in their own building.<br><br>Since we are all big boys and girls, it would be up to us to have a ND-NC and fee splitting agreement before moving forward to match people up. Also since nothing is free, I think that our sending Dandrew 1% or so of any fees generated to cover the cost of maintaining this group would be appropriate.<br><br>Let me know if there is any interest in this.  I was contacted by another Dandrew member to discuss this and he suggested that this might be able to be done as a private group on Linkedin.<br><br>Please let me know if there is any interest in this.        </p>

          Sal and Jack, while I am always open to doing business with professionals and I view everyone here as professionals because of the training they have been and are receiving, I am reluctant to give this a green light.<br><br>The main reason is because most here don&#39;t have funding sources outside of Dandrew. There are a few here with funding sources outside of Dandrew I sense but not many. I am against the fence on this.<br><br>I however am not opposed to having members email addresses listed, so if someone has a deal that is outside Dandrew&#39;s wheelhouse, a member can reach out to others.        </p>

          Rich here - We would welcome the opportunity to leverage the Intellectual Capital and the alternate funding sources that we have acquired in the years that Sal has been Mentoring in order to us to work with other members on deals that fall outside of the Dandrew wheelhouse.<br><br>Four or five years ago when we had our &quot;Day With Sal&quot; I had no knowledge of any of this world; and thanks to Sal&#39;s teachings (and patience) and Brenda&#39;s MBA, background and intelligence we now have associations with a number of other fund managers and private lenders; Term Sheets out, have started our own fund, and are actively marketing for more funding opportunities.<br><br>That said, we have also learned how to ask &quot;What Does A Bag Of Groceries Weigh?&quot; when we receive requests like &quot;Here is the Loopnet sheet - will you loan on this property?&quot;; so please follow Sal&#39;s Mentoring, start with the Five Data Points, etc. and keep acquiring more and more Intellectual Capital from Sal about all aspects of this fascinating world.<br><br>Please feel free to contact me at Rich@DusekNetwork.com - a.k.a. &quot;The Motor City Big-Mouth&quot; - (248) 705-1022        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to make a comment about being direct because I think some may not understand what direct means with regard to the buyer.<br><br>There is a term in the business which is Direct to the buyer entity. This also goes hand in hand with direct to the funder. While the words in the two terms above have a very firm meaning, what&#39;s important to understand is where this puts a Intermediary in the business which is far ahead of many and it allows us to play in the big leagues.<br><br>In bulk asset deals for example, sellers will say no Intermediaries or Brokers, only direct to buyer parties. Now who do you think this invites to the game? Us. We are direct to the buyer and on funding deals, direct to the funder. In both scenarios, Dandrew is the capital provider.<br><br>Now whoever Dandrew resells to after they buy or fund never factors into the picture because once Dandrew completes the deal, no one will ever question what play they make with another entity.<br><br>Sal had mentioned atleast twice as I can recall that in some transactions, Sal and another entity partner in a deal and have their own deal setup.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Wanted to update you on todays call I had regarding the bulk reo package in Orlando, Florida. The call went very well. As I preach to others about controlling the call. I went right to the brass tacks. <br><br>I told him we are not interested in land pieces or junker properties where it will cost us more to acquire than the value dictates. I told him the asset value had to be $60K minimum and we would need to see the tape, preferably in excel format and it will take about 5 to 7 days for a LOI to be issued, so if they are of the mindset of I need a bid now not after you look at the tape, we are not going to share a synergistic deal space.<br><br>I told him we are well funded because we are backed by a large and successful fund. I asked who the owner of the assets are and he said his firm. I asked if they have all the files and he said they are here onsite.<br><br>I asked when they need to close by and he said they can be flexible. Here is a summary of the deal, spreadsheet to be submitted tomorrow.<br><br>43 assets, all tenanted. Orlando, Florida area. All properties have been professionally rehabbed in the last 12 to 36 months. Reason for selling, to take funds and reinvest into multi family projects.<br><br>Pricing expectations a bit high but willing to adjust to make a deal happen. Asset value minimums are $65,000.00. This is a direct from seller entity and they are willing to speak direct with buyer.<br><br>LOI in our time frame, POF at later stage. You will have this deal in the deals box tomorrow or later this evening.         </p>

          Please help me better understand your response to Glenn Saffary’s request for Proof of Funds: “With that said, we would never deliver a $25mm POF. No one would believe a student would have $25mm”<br>My interpretation of your response is that we present ourselves as “students” while calling banks, brokers, etc. I would imagine nobody would spend time dealing with students, and the whole purpose of the Credibility Kit is to prove the world that we are serious players. <br>Please help me understand if there is any update in the program that I am not aware of.<br>Thank you<br>        </p>

          I am going to because I have Sal&#39;s blessing post something later today about my experiences in being in a live deal with Sal. I will say that the last time I looked, Sal has made it very clear that the POF when issued were only for $2M and was only available to Private Equiteer and Arbitragers.<br><br>One thing I have learned about Sal is like it or hate it, he is brutally honest and tells it like it is. I don&#39;t sense that Sal refers to anyone as just a student and feels that  no one would believe any Intermediaries wouldn&#39;t have that kind of money, but lets face reality here. Not one Intermediary here has $25,000,000.00 in their bank account.<br><br>This is my two cents<br><br>I        </p>

          Sal,<br>I need some guidance on a deal I&#39;m going to look at Thursday. This is direct from the sellers. 45 properties that are off market, all tenanted, all properties have been professionally rehabbed over course of past 36 months, located in Orlando, Florida.<br><br>Where I need the guidance is in what the minimum asset value you need to see in that market for bidding and what would be the mindset of Dandrew if the properties were priced below market but had a value where you needed each asset to be.<br><br>They have several deals they want to get done, however this particular deal is a priority for them, reason unknown until the call.        </p>

          Sal-<br>I wanted to give you a update on some other things going on. I have a call with a bank President of a west coast bank who has several portfolios they want to move off their balance sheets. They have both NPN and performing notes. Obviously they are going to have different pricing expectations for the performing package(s). <br><br>The President of the bank asked for a Saturday call because they want to move on these.

          Sal,<br>New update on what I posted last night. The deal for the Philadelphia Reo&#39;s is 61 properties in the Philadelphia suburbs with some Philadelphia City properties mixed in. The bank asset manager informed me that we can do a carve out because a few of the properties are land but if we wanted to go all-in, they are ready to get creative. They&#39;re looking to get $6.3 million for the entire portfolio.<br><br>The portfolio is from a small regional bank. They can be flexible on time to close. They are motivated to sell and their expectations on what the properties will actually net them off of gross dollars generated from the sell has been bought to a level of complete understanding across the board. In other words, they know they may not get as high a bid as they would like to have had but they are ok.<br><br>The NPN portfolio of firsts, the updated spreadsheet is okay, nothing to get excited about. They are flexible, we will just have to look at the spreadsheet. I think we could get by initially with a handle. On properties $40K and below, they are at 30%, $40K to 60K at 45% and above $60K at 50%. These are their expected target offers.<br><br>I will keep you updated.        </p>

          Sal,<br>For whatever reason I seem to be getting deals from this company that builds Assisted Living Facilities that wants to do mezz deals. They are experienced, 29 years and 30 developments later they are finding they need to go this route.<br><br>They do things this way. They line up bank funding for the first lien, and they bring real cash equity to the deal and they plan to go get a mezz piece bought in to round out the capital and debt stack. They use the 1 to 3 term model to refi out or straight sell asset to get the mezz team out. The funds from the mezz piece is used to finish out construction and lease up hard costs.<br><br>Can we make a play here. They meet the hard criteria of being experienced, being involved with their asset class and successful with it, they are experienced sponsor operators who know how the financing game is played, bring real cash equity from their own seasoned resources and are bankable.<br><br>My feeling us that we could do the mezz piece, turn around and buy out the first lien holder, and controlling the entire deal and capture all the profits.        </p>

I am told the President of the bank and their Director of asset sales is willing to do a conference call to answer any if the hard questions, we may have.<br><br>I inquired why they haven&#39;t moved the portfolio yet and I am told they have had interest from broke brokers, his words, with no financial backing.<br><br>I assured him we are not a broke broker and we are well capitalized, and we are ready to do business, if we decide to move forward, once we take a look at what they have.<br><br>Anyway, I wanted to update you on where we are at. I have several additional deals coming next week.        </p>

          Can someone answer a simple question.  The services I&#39;m offering regarding providing money for the DIP or the Commercial lending through your program, would I need to get a Money Broker License?  Here in North Dakota in the ND Financial Institutions states that the Money Broker has to be licensed through the  National Mortgage Licensing System and the license is $900.00 AND to be Bonded?  OR is there a way I dont Need a license.  How is everyone else dealing with this??????<br><br>The state statue states:<br>&quot;Money broker&quot; means a person or entity who, in the ordinary course of business,<br>engages in money brokering.<br><br>&quot;Money brokering&quot; means the act of arranging or providing loans or leases as a form<br>of financing, or advertising or soliciting either in print, by letter, in person, or otherwise,<br>the right to find lenders or provide loans or leases for persons or businesses desirous<br>of obtaining funds for any purposes.<br><br>13-04.1-02. Money broker license required.<br>Except as otherwise provided, a person other than a money broker licensed and authorized<br>under this chapter may not engage in money brokering in the state of North Dakota without a<br>money broker license issued by the commissioner. A person engages in money brokering in<br>North Dakota if the borrower resides in North Dakota.<br><br><br>How is everyone else dealing with this??????  <br><br>Thanks        </p>

          Major<br><br>I believe I answered this already. And its not simple, as I&#39;m not an attorney nor am I qualified to render legal advice. I would contact a competent *local* counsel if you have any more questions.  <br><br>To repeat myself here is what I placed on here almost a month ago:<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>Major:<br><br>We&#39;re going to have something this next weekend that will speak to the legal side. I just have finished recording something with our counsel. <br><br>This should clarify this. <br><br>Now, we&#39;re doing this as I am not an attorney, nor am I qualified to render any legal advice. However, in the video I do speak about in the Q&amp;A how we&#39;ve paid intermediaries for deals in the past without having a license. So the content was there, you just chose not to see this or acknowledge this, in my opinion. <br><br>No one else has had an issue with this, if this is not a good enough of an answer, you are free to retain your own legal counsel as this is as far as I am allowed to discuss this, understood? <br><br>I&#39;m here to answer member&#39;s questions about deal sourcing and transactional structuring, generally speaking. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal, <br>I too am obviously not an attorney, however in most states from what I&#39;ve read, unless your arranging residential mortgages, you do not need to be licensed or bonded.<br><br>As Intermediaries, we are not acting in the capacity of a broker. A mortgage Broker in the traditional sense of the title is someone who takes in a loan request, packages the loan for underwriting purposes and submits that package through a internal network of funding sources and waits for a quote and a good faith estimate of costs.<br><br>We are dealing with private institutional monies from one resource, meaning Dandrew, so there is a big difference between what we do and what those who act in the traditional capacity of a Mortgage Broker does.<br><br>I have never had a real estate broker, a commercial client or anyone else in a transaction ask for a brokers license.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a potential client who wants to do a $4.6 million mezz or pref equity deal behind a bank that has committed $16.6 mill into an assisted living facility as a new first. Borrower is bringing $2 mill of their own equity to deal. They have 20 plus years experience as sponsor operators.<br><br>I emailed you but am guessing my email is mixed in amongst a lot of emails and you haven&#39;t seen it. They want to use use the mezz piece to finish out construction and do the lease up.<br><br>Is this something Dandrew can do? I am thinking no however since there have been changes to the programs and that this isn&#39;t a straight development deal.<br><br>As always, thank you.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was sitting at my desk in my office and was looking at my Linkedin connections list and it made me think of something you have said over and over. I wanted to just touch on it.<br><br>I setup this Linkedin page I&#39;m guessing about a month ago and really started plugging into it about two weeks ago on a regular bases. I am at 379 connections. Just in the last three days I&#39;ve been approached by maybe twenty who want to talk next week, seeing this is weeks end.<br><br>One connection has a portfolio of 879 SfR&#39;s that they are holding the paper on, 800 first liens and 79 seconds that they want to  move off their balance sheet. They are the owners of record for all of these. I asked what their pricing expectations are and I made it clear were not going to be or ever be at par and his reply is that the buyers exposure will be at probably less than 50. He said it&#39;s his paper and he can be flexible in his pricing expectations. I also asked is he in bankruptcy or heading for a divorce from a business partner or spouse and he said no, we are moving into development, this would be a better choice for them than taking on new debt, then having to refi out of that debt and put permanent financing in place. <br><br>This is just one deal that&#39;s coming. My point in bringing this up is this. For new IM&#39;s, when Sal says this is a relationship business, he really is being candid and truthful as always.<br><br>In this business, if your going to really dig in and really make plays, you have to establish relationships. Banking used to be referred to as the old boys network and in some ways it still is. The best deals go to those who others share relationships with and if you do not believe you can get yourself engrained in this and be part of the culture of  building those type of deal making relationships, than your success is going to be limited.<br><br>You will read about the Blackstone Group, Leon D. Blacks Apollo Management Group, JP Morgan and others if you are reading the Bloomberg, Wall Street Journal, etc. You will read about all the big deals they do but not the smaller deals in the $5 million to $30 million dollar range. There is not one IM here in this membership that cannot pickup a phone, call those offices and talk to someone about becoming their outsourcing firm for these smaller deals that they are not transacting because it&#39;s not in their investing model.<br><br>Some will say I can&#39;t do that, what do I say, what happens if they ask me this, what do I say to those questions. The answer is use your intellectual capital Sal is providing and go for it. The worst thing that can happen is they will say no, they will say no, not interested, and the best thing  they can say is wow, no one has ever approached us, yes we want to do that.<br><br>It all starts with taking action and putting into action what we are learning here. Sal, sorry to be long winded, it&#39;s my passion for this business running out of my fingers as I type this.        </p>

          Sal, this is fir AJ, let me walk the walk, this may be long. <br><br>AJ,<br><br>Thank you for Everything you are doing for us all, whether were  at the Banker level or at the top in the Private Equity  side of the business.<br><br>I for one, have noticed all the tremendous amount of endeavors you&#39;ve taken in and made happen. As I stated earlier today, No one in this business offered this level of training and /or support. <br><br>Let me take that further. The return on investment/ROI for every dollar a IM spends with Dandrew is infinite. Please keep up the great work your doing and please know that while I don&#39;t speak for the remainder of the members, I wanted to take a few moments today to reach out to you and let you know my thoughts.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Your Friend,<br><br>James Balter        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a few comments about today&#39;s call. I think if anyone on the call is not immediately going through their rolodex or thinking about how they can get the word out about their business should stroll down the walk of shame.<br><br>I think what AJ is doing for everyone working in conjunction with Sal is really for everyone&#39;s benefit and that the things they are doing for the team is important and that it needs to be said that NO one other than these two guys will ever do what Sal and AJ do, this is unheard of in the business.<br><br>When I started at JP Morgan years ago, I was shown where my desk was at and how to use the phone system and I was given a book of policies. No one offered this much training and support. It was either sink or swim. I think everyone should be sending a thank you note to AJ, so he knows we all appreciate what he does. <br><br>For those that are new here, when you receive a email from Sal that says Infographic enclosed or words similar to that, you need to open that email. Sal gives everyone 48 hours to download it or it will cost you money to buy. The information in these infographics is priceless.<br><br>Now, if anyone does not think that emails sent are not tagged with a receipt to show AJ and Sal who opens the emails and who doesn&#39;t, I would think that through.<br><br>Anyway, I wanted to give some thoughts on the call.<br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal asked me to post a little something about how far I&#39;ve come, but it wanted to go a bit further. I am a guy who went to college and majored in accounting. My goal was to do forensic accounting for the FBI. After college, I remember reading the Wall Street Journal and really fell in love with the idea of working on the street and that took me to JP Morgan and later to First Chicago Trust Company of NY.<br><br>I got involved with brokering mortgage notes. I didn&#39;t buy a late night tv or internet course. I studied the buyers and their parameters and begun marketing for clients. I built a book of business simply by telling a story built around who, what, when, where, why and how. I learned no one cares about your story, just what you can do for them. It&#39;s not about you it&#39;s about the client.<br><br>I made money and moved in and out of various business ventures and learned a lot. Fast forward to this year and a chance sighting of a Facebook ad for the banker program with Dandrew. I went through the video&#39;s, printed off the attachments and I mean them all, printed these out along with the infographics, read the concepts and everything and put them all in binders. The very first section of the binder is the owners manual, which I refer to and after it is The Storm and everything else after.<br><br>I asked questions on Ask Dandrew and along the way, got my knuckles slapped by Sal all along the way, learning. I&#39;ve read every question on Ask Dandrew and all  the forums. I&#39;ve emailed Sal about ideas and learned from Sal that you need to spent time reading the Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, etc.<br><br>I just upgraded to Private Equiteer because I want to partner with a winner and that winner is Sal and Dandrew. I learned a lot from the banker program but want to take my business to the highest level and you must become a Private Equiteer. This is where the grow ups play. If you look at the titans of Wall Street and you hear how they made $15,000,000.00 last year, chances are they made it in private equity.<br><br>What is the outcome of just taking the time to learn, ask questions, talking with key people in the markets you want to become involved with, your phone will ring and your emails will go bing.<br><br>I have a call in two weeks with a firm that buys Pools of notes every ninety days on average. They can&#39;t get enough capital from their bank, essentially their bank has said were done, we&#39;ve reached your limit, not the banks limit. This is potentially $10 million dollars every quarter. <br><br>I&#39;ve got calls just today from commercial brokers who have clients who are experienced sponsor operators who cannot get money as easy as they could in 2007. They need money and they don&#39;t care what it costs. A property manager called and said they want to buy one if the multi families they manage that is for sale but off market and they have a minority partner who will put up the 25% equity needed.<br><br>How easy is this. All I did was pickup the phone and simply ask them if either themselves or someone they know needs capital for a commercial real estate opportunity. I mention that my firm has funds available to deploy.<br><br>I never mention Sal or Dandrew. I am the originator  of the deal. If you raise your skirt and start talking about Sal and Dandrew, then your divulging where your capital comes from.<br><br>My point in this is that if you don&#39;t get the word out and how great your product is, meaning the money that you and Dandrew bring, then any and all potential clients will go to your competition.<br><br>If it was not for Sal Buscemi, his love of helping others get into this business and doing it the right way, I wouldn&#39;t be where I&#39;m at right now but even with all Sal makes available, all the tools, the infographics, the programs which are not courses but rather business opportunities and profit centers, if it wasn&#39;t for getting off my rear end and actually working, I wouldn&#39;t be going anywhere except where someone else told me I needed to be.        </p>

          To Everybody<br>Many deals posted in Dandrew Comunity require buyers aligned (e.g. Performing-Non Performing Notes/REOs). So far I rejected all these deals because my buyer list is not completed yet. Please advise what is the scope of your Comment?  Are you asking Sal to qualify your deal before sending it to your investor? As far as I know, Sal does not buy anything (the best case scenario, he may be an equity partner).<br>Thank you for your time to respond, it will bring light to a lot of confusion; greatly appreciated! <br>Fulga<br>        </p>

          Fulga, I always reference the fact that you have to listen and hear what Sal says on the calls. I&#39;ve heard atleast twice out of the previous three Friday calls where Sal has said &quot; We don&#39;t buy things we lend on them&quot;. Your comment will hit home for many I would think.        </p>

          Hi Fulga, for the most part, we are financiers seeking commercial real estate projects to fund either as debt and/or equity. Therefore, we need to prospect for buyers and borrowers. If you are an experienced operator, and you have the equity, you might be able to bring a deal of your own account to Dandrew. However, I would confirm this with Sal in order to avoid wasting any time. <br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>If I may comment on the recent questions regarding what Intermediaries should name their business. I think it&#39;s important to mention that Sal and Dandrew have covered this in the first part of your owners manual.<br><br>When I was going to college and I was taking a class on Advertising it was always mentioned that you need to create a name for your business that accomplishes two objectives which are A) Tells people what you do and B) is simple to remember.<br><br>So for example, my company is called JJB Capital Advisors. Since I am in Dandrews Private Equiteer Opportunity, I am a Capital Advisor. Also this is a easy name to remember for most anyone.<br><br>Don&#39;t use fancy slogans, fancy graphics, etc. Keep it easy and simple but professional.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I found this article on The Bloomberg. I thought the members here would like to read it. Its about CLO&#39;s. The link is <br> http://bloom.bg/1cS87sc.<br><br>Many Intermediaries are focused on Equity, however, I am sensing that there are lots of opportunities on the debt side to make plays as well. I am not a debt expert however I am going to become more knowledgeable on it.        </p>

          Student Housing Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.<br><br> I am not quite sure if you are interested in equity deals, but here it goes: <br><br>Description: 316 unit Class A student housing project adjacent to Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.  The University is growing rapidly, with enrollment of 35,000 students in 2013 expected to grow to 40,000 students by 2018.  Project is under construction and now pre-leasing, with approximately half of the buildings scheduled for completion before August 2014.  <br>Developer is seeking equity partner to take out bridge loan and complete capital stack, which is currently contemplated as:<br> <br>Senior loan (committed)                               $21,500,000       <br>Mezzanine loan (committed)                          6,000,000<br>Investor equity                                                       5,189,000<br>Developer equity                                                  1,000,000<br>Total cost                                                             $33,689,000<br> <br>Alternatively, if partner is not comfortable with mezz structure, investor equity would need to be increased to replace it.<br> <br>Under mezz structure, stabilized NOI = $2,513,860 for yield on cost of 7.46 %.  Sale at 36 months at 6.25% cap rate results in a levered project IRR of 27.56%.<br><br>Fulga<br>        </p>

          He needs a local bank. Here&#39;s why. We don&#39;t do take-out loans. No one will pay bridge rates for a take-out. Or is there more to the story that I&#39;m not seeing?         </p>

          I think the issue with this deal is that it is not income producing yet and even though it is student housing does not guarantee a smooth ride in leasing circles.<br><br>One of the big issues I see is that there is already a construction loan possibly in place. They would need a take out loan and I agree with Sal, the best place to get that is with a local bank. If it were me I would source who the local lender or lenders have been on other student housing deals at that University and approach them to do a take out loan and get the construction lender out of the deal.        </p>

          Sal, Fulga mentioned it that it is Class A Student Housing at a Texas University. My comment about it may not be a smooth ride in leasing circles is based up the following. North Texas University in Denton, Tx has several student housing projects that are not 100% leased and have had to use strategies where they are almost giving away the farm to gain interest.<br><br>At University of Texas Arlington, which is two miles from my home has a lot of student units that are not all leased out because the buildings are not part of the University and the University has no incentive to do anything more than add the buildings to a list of other properties and because they own properties of their own that they obviously have more incentive to market.        </p>

          Yes. That is good local, &#39;insider knowledge&quot; that we we get to during desktop due diligence. <br><br>The moral of this story applies is this: just because a strategy is successful in most or some markets, doesn&#39;t mean that it will be successful in *all* markets.         </p>

          Sal,<br>In your opinion, is it viable to contact smaller banks and credit unions and offer to take off their hands any loans where the payor has missed 1 or 2 payments but have yet failed to actually go delinquent enough for the bank to pull the trigger on filing a formal default notice and begin the foreclosure process?<br><br>I got to thinking that we really could become their problem solver at the front end instead of the back end, after the bank has spent money on the legal and taking even a bigger hit.<br><br>The caveat could be that they package up the loans in a loan pool scenario and we buy the loans in bulk as opposed to single transactions.        </p>

          Sal-<br>Are lending parameters for DIP loans the same as the general parameters given to us, specifically the minimum loan amount?  I have a potential DIP requirement from an initial cold call to a BK attorney, but loan amount will likely be in the low to mid $1M&#39;s.  Thanks!<br>- Chris        </p>

          Sal,<br>Some who are new may be struggling because they don&#39;t really understand what Dandrew is about and what the basis of the system is, so I wanted to give my take.<br><br>Sal and the guys are not a group of wealthy guys playing the game of commercial real estate for their own wallets. They are a real firm with two offices. They have overhead, employees, and they are a true Wall Street Investment Firm.<br><br>They invest other people&#39;s discretionary funds. The clients of the firm come to Dandrew because they know that their funds will be professionally invested and managed. They invest their monies into the various funds that Dandrew manages in house.<br><br>Why do these firms go this route? Because what they do is no different than what your own employer does with your 401K. Monies are invested into various funds with these funds chosen because each fund fits the clients investment philosophies. Some funds invest for the short term cash or they invest for the long term wealth, very much like being a real estate investor. You need quick cash, you buy a flip property or if you want long term wealth accumulation, you buy and hold.<br><br>The advantage you have in joining the firm as a Intermediary is that your capital provider is Dandrew and you don&#39;t have to strike broker deals with multiple firms like many intermediaries have to.<br><br>Dandrew makes their money from management fees, equity spreads, joint ventures with other firms, so my point is these guys work very hard. They are serious financiers and they expect each intermediary to be serious as well, this is why they have a credibility kit, serious profit center programs, a trading desk for each intermediary to add to their business.<br><br>This is real life, real Wall Street Business and those guys eat, sleep and breath this business and if you listen really well to what Sal says on the Friday calls, he vocalizes this, you just have to listen and hear.<br><br>You need to understand that once you enter the Dandrew World, you are expected to operate your intermediary practice as if you are a Wall Street firm. Your expected to work. Your expected to be serious.<br><br>Right now you need to ask yourself why your here. What do you want from this? If you are here to become super wealthy and become a jet setter, well than you probably won&#39;t see that happen, just because you want it to be. Those who go into a venture with that intention or goal rarely see it happen.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick observation on the distressed asset marketplace. I read an article at 5 am this morning where it is looking like overall market conditions for assets that are pooled are getting better, however, due to the amount  of commercial debt to the tune of I believe it was quoted at ten trillion dollars and counting is increasing, mostly because of those commercial property owners not being able to readily refi through convention banking channels, we are going to see a new wave of distressed assets entering the secondary markets.<br><br>It is like one drug dealer gets busted and off the streets and a new one takes over that guys market. This got me to really thinking, well not about the drug dealer occupation, but from a marketing standpoint, that every Intermediary here has a great opportunity to make a play in almost every asset class because instead of dealing with the financial institutions who hold the paper, we can now reach out to and appeal to those asset owners themselves who really have no chance of being kept from being any more upside down than they are or soon to be.<br><br>Any thoughts on this?        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just some observations about the call today. First, as always, great information and great  call by you and AJ. I think people are missing one important caveat of Dandrew&#39;s business model, which is we lend on assets not buy them. I think if this can be wrapped around, there will less time spent pursuing deals that will not be looked at.<br><br>Another important thing to mention is that the more complex a deal the longer it will take to close. Naturally some deals take longer to close, and this is where deal management and heavy lifting come into play.<br><br>I think the question should always be asked when a Intermediary first looks at a deal is If I, meaning the Intermediary were going to invest their own money into a deal, would this be that deal.<br><br>Just a few thoughts.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a observation about being direct. I think some are not understanding what it means to be direct. This us for the new people. The only way you will get to be direct is to speak to and get your deal docs and answers to the five data points from the decision maker.<br><br>When someone is dealing with intermediaries and gate keepers, you will never get to be direct and please know that you can sign every NCND and NDA there is and you will never get close, unless your dealing with the real estate broker, attorney, CPA, etc.<br><br>You never want to deal with anyone who is not the decision maker, because what generally happens is you get someone else&#39;s interpretation of the deal details and no one can agree to terms except the decision maker.        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Good to see you back at the helm. I wanted to pass on a strategy I have used for years to build a book of contacts in the commercial real estate space.<br><br>I go to the website www.cityfeet.com and I type in the city and state as well as select the asset class I want to search. I then look at each property advertised for sale. I then wrote down the brokers agency name, brokers name, phone number and email address if listed.<br><br>I then call that broker during day time business hours, which is very important to know, because you look much more professional when you call during business hours.<br><br>I introduce myself as follow. My name is James Balter, I am the CEO and Director of Capital Markets for JJB Capital Advisors. I am calling you today because I was once referred to you as someone who has clients who needc funding for commercial real estate opportunities.<br><br>When can we meet at your office to discuss doing some business. That is it, From there, the response is usually either, when are you available James, right now I do not have any clients who need funding but do you have a media package for your firm you can email me or I have a client or clients who really need funding and then its either lets meet today or tomorrow or I get to hear a country music song.<br><br>Either way, this is a system I have used for years and years, from my days of brokering notes in the early 1990&#39;s to today. Try it, it works.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick observation that was a result if a consulting meeting I did today. Your thoughts would be a welcomed help. I make additional revenues on real estate consulting assignments in the commercial sector.<br><br>A local limousine company hired me to source commercial locations for their expansion. I located several locations with each location having a different real estate company attached. In discussing what I do especially with my ability to bring capital to deals thanks to my relationship with Dandrew, one realtor said to me, gee do you realize you could make a fortune specializing in funding for warehouse and flex space deals.<br><br>My reply was I can arrange funding for these types of deals. My question is as follows. Should we look at specializing in a particular area?<br><br>I think there is a better chance to get more opportunities to make plays in lucrative deals if we specialize because we get to make markets as opposed to joining the party late.<br><br>What are your thoughts?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Yes.  Flex and warehouse - *in certain markets* - can make you a fortune. <br><br>That is true. <br><br>The limo companies: usually are good fronts for money laundering, so you know they are flush with some cash to pay you…<br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal, <br>I received your email about being out of the office. Thank you for that. I wanted to pass on something that I experienced today and it was a bad call. I wanted to pass this on as a glimpse of what a bad call is.<br><br>I received a call from a commercial real estate broker and they have a client who wants to buy in Detroit. I asked why and they said its a place with a lot of opportunity, and I said well I just don&#39;t see it.<br><br>They became very defensive and told me they grew up there. I asked what is the difference in population between now and this time last year. I mentioned the city has no available money to capitalize on any opportunity and that they were willing to mortgage their own baseball team just to afford to bills that are 180 days past due.<br><br>I clarified what I meant by not seeing opportunity which was that I do not see my capital provider willing to fund in Detroit.<br><br>They said that they are hearing this a lot and my question was well if you were lending your own funds, would you fund in Detroit? I then went into education mode. I explained that no private lender is going to want to place funds into properties with a NOI that was mediocre and with the city in the situation it is in, finding strong NOI&#39;s in properties was not going to be possible, right now.<br><br>I asked them if they had approached lenders in Detroit and they said no one would fund there. My question than was this. A local funder won&#39;t fund in their own city. I asked if this struck a chord with them?<br><br>They said I know nothing. I said well your incorrect on that because I understand true market conditions which in this case are not strong and not incentivized. I said as a commercial broker it&#39;s your job to sell the opposit of true market conditions.<br><br>My point in posting this is as follows. Know the markets your working in. Know what&#39;s going on, know the deals that are coming to town. Don&#39;t raise capital for deals in areas that are like Detroit. Logically, there is the argument that the city is depressed so there are opportunities, however, in reality, when a city or area is as depressed as a Detroit, even the prime opportunities are not prime.<br><br><br>        </p>

          James: <br><br>Let me bottom line this for you: <br><br>*If this was your entire life savings, would you invest with this guy in Detroit because he brow-beat you and was from there?*<br><br>*Sal&#39;s Rule: Always look at the numbers dispassionately. When emotion gets into an investment, that is how you get fleeced.*<br><br>Good dialogue and thanks for posting here. It seems like you - and hopefully the community here - will learn from this. <br><br>And, brokers will never have an alignment of interest with you ever. Never take advice from someone who doesn&#39;t have some skin in the game. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Its 0335 am in Arlington, Texas. I&#39;ve already did my morning run, walked the dogs and I am about to sit and read the Bloomberg from yesterday as well as The Wall Street Journey and its on to business, yes business on a Saturday.<br><br>I wanted to reflect on yesterdays call a bit and usually my comments are really for the new people. It wasn&#39;t long ago that I was new here and I know how it is to struggle with something.<br><br>Someone asked about motels and my mother owned a motel in Edison, NJ from the time I was three until I was 17. Motels are generally not high income generating by single facility. When you have a chain such as a Motel 6 or a Super 8, where your a corporate entity operating a volume business, meaning you have 30 doors plus per single operating facility and over 100 total facilities, than your earning revenues that can be significant.<br><br>Here is the link to a publication about how hotels and motels are valued. The link is: http//www.hvs.com/content/971.pdf.<br><br>Someone also asked where do I get started, what do I do. This is normal. First thing you do is locate a client and obtain answers to the five date points.<br><br>You go to www.DandrewDeals.com and you complete the submission form and submit it. Now instead of waiting for Sal or one of The Dandrew team to get back to you, be pro active and make contact with the client and simply say, &quot;Mr/Mrs/Ms, my funding team is reviewing the initial information you provided to determine if we can fund your deal where it is a win-win for everyone. I expect to have a preliminary answer for you in the next 24 to 48 hours, however, I have some additional questions for you, do you have some time to further discuss your deal?&quot;. <br><br>Now this is where you are going to move onto the Phase 2 questions that are in the banker program and after you obtain the answers to the questions, you than thank them for their time and you simply end the call by saying, &quot;If we are ready to move forward, what would be the turn around time for you to get together the documents we would need? if they ask which documents, just simply say, At this point, we have all we need, I will know what particular documents we would require, once I have been informed that we wish to move forward.<br><br>Now, most will begin asking about points and fees and your answer better be, Sir/mam, until I know we are going to want to move forward, I am not in a position to discuss that. Now here is something very important to say. &quot;If I were to quote you fees and the such right now, I may be incorrect, however, most deals are 75% of the appraised value, 2 to 3 points, 1 to 3 year term, 10 to 14% interest, with interest only payments monthly, with principle and remaining interest payable at the end of term.<br><br>You want to get to know these terms and be able to say them where it does not sound like your reading off a rate sheet. It has to come from you in an authoritive tone of voice.<br><br>One more tip. Always control your deal. Have a deal sheet setup for each deal. This is important as it begins a paper trail for each deal. Keep deal specific notes to include dates, times, who you discussed something with. If your clients admin, Shirley tells you the boss is out of town only to receive a terse email from your client, you can reply back with, Sir, Shirley informed me on Friday of last week, that you were out of town and out of pocket on receiving emails.<br><br>Anyway, these are just my observations and some things I wanted to pass on to the new people who have all the great tools at their disposal and wonder what next.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>The call today is still ongoing in the Q and A right now, and I wanted to say great call and the updates to what&#39;s coming is exciting.<br><br>I was looking at the Ofree Website and a thought came to mind. Couldn&#39;t Dandrew IM&#39;s make a market niche for themselves by working with Joint Ventures in commercial real property ownership where one partner wants to get out for any number of reasons, but none the less wants out .<br><br>On a deal like this, would the biggest obstacle to getting a deal done be the remaining partner not wanting to sign off on the deal or would it be the percentage of ownership the selling partner has and how do you price a deal like this?        </p>
