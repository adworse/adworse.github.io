          Hi,<br>During the call this morning, AJ suggested I contact &quot;Ask Andrew&quot; with my question.<br>So...I&#39;m a commercial mortgage broker in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have provided several loans for a developer client during the past 6 months.  They buy small commercial properties - ranging from $1 million to $5 million (industrial, mobile home parks, residential development and flex office in Northern California) that need some improvements, entitlements, or other value add.  At the completion of the work they flip the properties and make a nice profit.  <br>They don&#39;t have deep pockets and have been bringing in outside investors with whom they have a professional acquaintance for equity on their deals - they typically property at 50%, with 50% equity.  Those investors are starting to get a little &quot;bitchy&quot; by throwing their weight around in an unproductive (and unprofessional) way.  The result is clients want to bring in new investors to fund their deals, and they asked me to lead that effort for them.<br>On the call this morning I asked AJ for some guidance on how to price my services to these developers, in terms of points and equity interest I should receive as compensation for bringing them new equity investors.  AJ drew a blank on the question and suggested I might need to buy another product, and that you could better advise me.<br>Can you suggest how to price the deals I&#39;m asking about or (more likely), do you have suggestions about a product that could help me with my pricing dilemma?<br>Also, I was out of town (in Iowa) from last Friday until Tuesday night (with no regular internet access) and didn&#39;t see the scripts offered in Sal&#39;s email on Sunday.  I saw Sal&#39;s email Wednesday morning, but it was too late to download the scripts.  I also saw they would be offered later for $97.00, so can I buy those scripts?<br>Thank you.<br>Dennis<br>        </p>

          Dennis: <br><br>Retail investors are – as a rule – a huge pain in the ass. They don’t understand markets, deals and like to pretend they are the big man/woman on campus. <br><br>If they have a business plan, which during this preliminary point all I would need to see is their: <br><br>1.  *Bios.*<br>Who they are and what they do. Resumes, etc. <br><br>2.  *Deal Sheet.*<br>A list of deals they’ve done. Includes: deal name, asset type, basis they bought at, basis they exited out, return to investors; <br><br>Then that would be enough to see if they qualify for a JV Equity Facility. Meaning they have a checkbook that requires 2 signatures (ours and their’s…)<br><br>Review your Private Equiteer training (JV vs Fund Structures) for more info on this. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;ve invested in a few Dandrew products - DIP Financing, Hooked on Overages, Capital Syndicator, Mezz Financing &amp; Pref. Equity, Arbitrageur, and recently bought your Briefcase.  But I&#39;m not a Private Equiteer (unless it&#39;s known by a different name), and don&#39;t see anything in what I have that&#39;s called &quot;JV Equity vs. Fund Structures&quot;.  I&#39;ll be the first to say I may well be missing something.  Where can I find the info on Private Equiteer or &quot;JV Equity vs. Fund Structures&quot;?<br>As I wrote the various products (above), it occurred to me that you could probably suggest the order in which I study them.  I would appreciate your help with that also.<br>Thanks.<br>Dennis        </p>

          Hi Dennis: <br><br>This is great. If you are a Private Equiteer, you’re going to go here http://funding.kajabi.com and login. If you have problems with your password, go to DandrewHelpDesk.com and they can reset your password for you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;m a commercial mortgage broker in the SF Bay Area.  I&#39;ve been bringing in debt financing for a small commercial developer (2 partners) buying small distressed or undervalued properties for a quick turnaround (in less than 12 months).  Average purchase price is about $3 million, and average debt of $1.7 million per deal.  They bring their own equity investors  to the deals (primarily local commercial brokers) and have had problems with those investors.  Nothing major - but enough that the developers want to eliminate that stress from their lives.<br>Now they want me to find investors for them - the general equity required will range from $1 million to $1.7 million per deal.<br>I meet with them on Thursday morning to discuss it.  I&#39;m willing to take it on, but I don&#39;t know the standard compensation for an equity raise like this.  What is a reasonable amount to charge the developers in terms of points (percent of equity raised) and as a percentage ownership in each deal?  Or maybe there&#39;s another way to structure compensation - I&#39;m in the dark and need help with this.<br>Thank your for your thoughts.<br>Dennis        </p>

          Dennis<br><br>I apologize that I’m getting to this now as I have been traveling lots lately, expecially late in April. <br><br>I would tell them that this is a *very specialized structured product* and this is expensive, both for your fees and the cost of capital. <br><br>Start there. People who want equity facilities (“lines of equity”) will pay on a typical profit split promote and an IRR look back of around 10-12% depending on how much new and fresh equity they are bringing to the table. <br><br>If you don’t know what this means, this is what JV Equity vs Fund Structures is about in your Private Equiteer program. <br><br>Sal <br>        </p>

          Hi,<br>The Pyramid of Priority Infographic looks to be pretty valuable, with details on approaching various entities shown on the pyramid.  But the type is so small it might as well be invisible.  Is there another version of the info shown on this PDF that is more usable, or at least easier to read?<br>Thanks.<br>Dennis        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I’m writing about Eastmont Town Center – a recent request from a sponsor for equity capital to buy a mixed use community center in Oakland, CA.  As you recall, you passed on this deal.  <br><br>I’m unclear on something in your email declining the deal.<br><br>I want to make sure I understand your comment about “term”.  You previously mentioned the maximum term for a deal like this was three years.  As a result the term was reduced to three years.  Now you’re saying this is too long.<br>Can you help me understand what caused the change on this?  And also what term you think is appropriate?<br><br>Also, since this isn’t a good fit for your equity sources I thought I would try family office type investors in the Bay Area.   Any thoughts on that?<br>Thanks.<br>Dennis<br><br>        </p>

          Dennis<br><br>Before you blow yourself out of the water, ask me this on a call tomorrow. <br><br>The problem is anyone can say &quot;Sure, I can get out in 36 months&quot;. <br><br>*That does not mean however they start trying to get takeout financing or try to sell at month 36. This means they need to be working toward that goal every single day in the project*. <br><br>In short, I have no conviction they know how to do this. And before you send it to a Family Office in the Bay Area who will ask you - you got it - the same question. <br><br>Sal        </p>
