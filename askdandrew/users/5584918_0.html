          Hi Sal &amp; AJ,<br><br>     I just wanted to thank you for a recent video recording explaining what a Coterminous Wrap is and how it&#39;s structured.  It was fortuitous as I was right at that stage in my $10M deal where it was timely for me to suggest that as an add to my commission.  See my email below to my Private Money Lender..........<br><br>Hi Sid,<br> <br> <br>      First, I want to thank you for your diligence in working tirelessly the past couple weeks in our efforts to close this loan.  I had a feeling you were going to respond to my email offering but I had no idea you were going to run with it at the speed of light.  It&#39;s very much appreciated.<br>  <br>     I spent some time preparing Innocent to be receptive to the idea that his loan did not conform to normal bridge financing as he cannot contribute any additional funds to closing and pre-closing costs.  He threw his life savings ($1MM) into the formation of Cleobrother&#39;s Intellectual Capital which resulted in physical products including pharmaceuticals, skin care, OTC medications &amp; University of Buffalo) licensed &quot;first in class&quot; medical devices.  I knew that it would be an up hill battle to find an Investor that would think opportunistically and willing to bend the &#39;status quo&quot;.  I encouraged Innocent to be cognizant of the fact that he will have to pay a premium on luring an Investor in by offering them an interest rate spread incentive.<br> <br>     I have postponed this email, intentionally, until I was relatively certain that a Term Sheet and funding were imminent.  Considering the work that Innocent and I have engaged in since February, I believe it&#39;s reasonable to consider asking you to include of a coterminous wrap of .5% (point five percent) to my Broker Compensation.  Conceivably, your cost of funds will be 8-10% and you&#39;ll be getting a spread of 5-7% for the term of your loan.  We will soon have the details determined and in writing.  I ask you to consider this request because I was instrumental in seeing the vision of this project through to completion (with your help, of course).  Cleobrothers has been seeking funding for 6-7 years and it took This Team to make it happen.  I welcome your response and look forward to working with you and Cleobrothers through funding, fulfillment and engineered growth far into the future.<br> <br> <br>Sincerely,<br> <br>Joel Ellowtiz<br>Independent Private Money Broker<br>Uintah Funding, LLC<br>w:  (801) 545-7276<br>c:  (801) 949-4872<br>Joel@UintahFunding.com<br><br><br>Broker Commissions being paid to me at closing (Tuesday, October, 27, 2015)  Loan Amount of $9,850,000.  Loan Term of 12 months and a second $10,000,000 round at end of year 1<br><br>2 Points-  $197,000<br>2% Equity Kicker-  Current Value $2M<br>                               -  in 6 months, after funding and delivery of $32M in Product-  Stock Value $5M<br>                               -  in 5-7 years- estim.

Thanks Again!<br><br><br>        </p>

          I have a Letter of Commitment from a hedge fund for a $20M for my client for the purpose of purchasing 2 industrial bldgs and working capital to fund expansion plans.  I&#39;ve been looking for a Hard Money loan for $400K to fund due dil &amp; some closing costs.  We will have a Financial Guarantee Bond in place to protect &amp; fund $416K should we fail to close ($16K = 4 pts to guarantee rate of return to Investor).  Why am I having a hard time finding a hard money lender to take this deal?  My Client will pay Investor back $560K (on $400K investment).  My Client will also issue 1,000,000 company shares ($1/share value = $1M in permanent shares).  Our Hedge Fund is ready to roll and I need to generate the $400K asap.  Any suggestions?  Can you suggest any VC or HM Lenders?  Fund Mgr. says we will fund in 15-30 days once we have $400K in place.  Thanks<br><br>Joel Ellowitz<br>joel@uintahfunding.com        </p>

          Hi Sal &amp; AJ,<br><br>     Please take a moment to look at the deal below.  Please offer suggestions on re-structuring, if necessary for funding or suggest to send it into dandrewdeals.com for consideration.  If it&#39;s out of our wheelhouse, please consider helping me place it with a lender that may be congruent with this, or a modified structure.  Thanks<br><br><br><br>Cleobrothers &amp; Company, LLC has invested, internally, through its Principles $1,000,000 into this start-up company.  This capital influx represents the life savings of Innocent Nweze (63% owner).  They have completed the development of their Intellectual Capital, including, but not limited to sourcing, testing and perfecting formulations for their proprietary lines of Cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices.  The current value of the company is estimated at $56,000,000.  There are 100M shares currently outstanding carrying a value of $1/share.  It’s estimated that by year end, the share price will be $2.50/share.  Mr. Nweze is offering 8% of the Company’s outstanding shares to the Lender that shares his vision and funds his project. The Company is planning to aggressively break out internationally and domestically, providing emerging market economies, the USA and Canada, the ability to enjoy their proprietary lines of Skin Care Products, Pharmaceuticals and Medical devices.<br><br>Cleobrothers began with a vision from its CEO, Mr. Nweze.  He has occupied top tier positions at exclusive businesses such as: Merck, Prometheus, King Pharmaceuticals, Abbott Labs and Cleobrothers for 30 years.  Mr. Nweze has excelled in sales, marketing and management positions and was instrumental in doubling and tripling sales and developing new products at the companies he’s represented.  He currently has 28 highly skilled employees waiting on the side to join him in his endeavors, as they know him and have worked with him over the years.  Mr. Nweze is keen in his vision and has invested his life savings into this project.<br>Cleobrothers is currently under contract to purchase a 70,000 sq.ft. warehouse at 77 Cyprus St. in Reynoldsburg, OH 43068.  The building’s grounds accommodate an expansion of 30,000 sq. ft. when the need arises.  We are seeking $5,000,000 for the purchase of the property ($2,45M) and the initial build-out of his manufacturing infrastructure ($2.55M), such as clean rooms, labs, tile over concrete and improved lighting (all building capital improvements).<br><br>The Company has contracted out the manufacturing of its first Purchase Order (P.O.) with a Nigerian Company that Mr. Nweze is very familiar with.  This P.O. is set to create $7.6M in revenue within the next 90 days.  Two other P.O.’s are contingent on the successful delivery of the first P.O.  P.O.’s 2 &amp; 3 are scheduled to deliver a collective revenue of $25M by year end, 2015.<br><br>This loan represents a good opportunity for the Lender who’s interested in a dynamic Company, well positioned in their market, and looking for great upside in an Opportunistic and Value Add addition to their portfolio.<br><br><br>NOI-   N/A (start-up Operation)<br>Proforma NOI-   Consolidated among Cosmetics, Pharmaceuticals &amp; Medical Devices<br>          Y 1                              Y 2                              Y3                              Y4                              Y5<br>  $74,224,192            $110,778,960          $156,351,564          $200,048,386          $248,930,851<br>Current Debt-    Porter Wright Morris &amp; Arthur LLP ($18,000)  Previous Law Firm.

Borrower is currently seeking an extension on REPC related to said purchase.  $2.55M to cover the build-out of clean rooms, labs, tile over concrete and improved lighting.  This $5M placement represents only one half of the funds necessary to complete the project for full production capability.  The balance will be coming from revenues generated from P.O. #1, due to fund in 60-90 days ($7.6M).  P.O.’s 2 &amp; 3 are due to fund within 120 days ($25M).  Lender will own 8% of Cleobrothers &amp; CO., LLC- current value, $8M.  Projected value Dec., 31, 2015 $20M.

          Hi Sal or AJ,<br><br>      I have a 276 unit Class B Multi-Family in Huntsville, AL.  They already have Debt placed at 80% LTV.

          Sal, why is this of interest?  First thing I see is NOI doubles in 5 years.  With 93% current occupancy how can that happen?  Next I see a 4 cap going in.   What am I missing?        </p>

          Hey Sal,  I am not aware of an escrow account that is Not at risk of loss through failure to perform. It sounds more like an Earnest Money deposit to me.   I&#39;m asking how would I structure the risk out of this deal?  I&#39;m inclined to say that my points be paid at funding through the loan proceeds.  My borrower contributes $36000 initially to Escrow for payment of I.O. payments.   Escrow instructions from my Lender should have a guarantee that the escrow pays out $3000 per month (12% I.O.) to the Lender and after 12 months, all escrowed funds, minus my points that were paid at funding, be returned to Lender forthwith.<br><br>My Client Says....<br>I have 30 years experience in the industry. I have obtained an LOI for $15M to buy commercial Real Estate in a JV partnership with ICON financial. They are waiving some of their normal requirements because the companies President really likes my experience and summary. They are only requiring a $300,000 escrow account be set up that will not be removed, these funds will stay in this account no longer than twelve months and released back to the investor. I will have to pay due diligence and some closing cost. So, I am asking for the $300,000 be funded on a twelve month loan which will be guaranteed in the documents to be released from escrow.         </p>

          Hi Sal<br>      I have been getting interest in land development loans lately.  I have one starting in a few months 35 miles North of downtown Salt Lake City.  I spent quite some time on the phone with the individual responsible for acquiring the loan.  He asked me to secure financing on Phase 1 totaling $1.2BB on a 3 year buildout.  You are the man......Read: God.........who can direct me to the firm capable of getting this done, if it&#39;s out of your wheelhouse.  Phase 1, 2, &amp;3 is estimated at 10 years construction time.<br>     I also have a development of $1.37MM and they&#39;re ready to go.  I also have an acquisition loan on (2) apartment complexes in Las Vegas with  a loan amount of $35MM at 65% LTV.  Please let me know if I should submit this last loan and give guidance as to where I should inquire on the other 2.  Thanks!<br>        </p>

          Joel<br><br>I’ve seen this already. For some reason, this wasn’t seen as being that desirable. I forget. But do this, always ask them how long they’ve been looking for capital. What has been the challenges? I think 10 years is too long for private capital and they should be going to local life companies. <br><br>Of course, you would know how to structure these and wouldn’t risk your credibility without having purchased *and read and watched* Land Development Financier first, right? I mean, that would be ridiculous… Go to DandrewMedia.com and click on Products. <br><br>$1.37mm development is too small. Do a Pitchbook, get family and friends to do that deal. <br><br>Send me in this string the 5 data points for the $35mm Las Vegas apartment complexes. Add them all together. Make it easy for me. Don’t fling poo. <br><br>Sal        </p>
