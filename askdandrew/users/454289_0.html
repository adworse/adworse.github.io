          I have a question about metrics.  Has anyone tracked their activity to results?  In setting activity goals, it would help to know how many contacts will typically result in a potential deal, and how many potential deals will result in an actual deal.        </p>

          Jim,<br> Not sure what happened to the rest of my post. To quickly summarize what I had written, there is no easy answer. Maybe 1 call, maybe 100, depends on the strength of the relationship. Focus on a few different approaches and market segments and then assess the results. The strategies that are yielding the best results, continue to work on, while determining ways to improve results from the others.        </p>

          Thanks for your response!  Are you saying if you are making cold calls it takes you 100 to get a prospect?  Or is that just a number you used for illustration, not from experience?  I know it is a difficult question to answer, how many calls I need to make.  My question was if anyone who is submitting deals now can give me an indication what it has taken them, so I can get a general idea where I need to be.  I&#39;m starting to think this is going to take some larger activity numbers than I thought at first.         </p>

          We email to a growing list of Commercial RE Professionals - currently about 2,000 addresses.  We send between 1,000 and 1,200 a month, on a rolling basis; changing the messages regularly.  We also talk with several brokers, etc. a day.  We have several submissions and an &#39;almost term sheet&#39;.  Each submission, Mastermind, weekend, etc makes us better at pre-qualifying and communicating with all involved.  We are also getting better at selecting who to market to; as well as how to market - all based on Sal&#39;s &#39;tough-love teaching&#39;.<br>All that said; you may get a term sheet and score a deal with your first submission; but with what we are doing we still do not have sufficient deal flow by our metrics.        </p>

          Refi to pay out a $2M judgment lien.  I have an antique shop owner who owns 7000 SF shop bldg in CA.  She says she has a $2M judgment lien on her property.  This lien is generated by a law suit from 1 business to another.  She lost her case so the lien is attached to her business bldg, which she owns out right free and clear.  She got an offer from Coldwell Banker for $3.8M but turned down b/c she wants to keep the bldg.  I didn&#39;t pursue further, but I think we can possibly treat the written offer an appraisal, can&#39;t we?  About 3 years ago, her gross income (need to check with her CPA to find out her NOI) is about $3-$4M/yr but b/c of illness her business went down.  Her current gross income is about $100k to $200/yr.  She owns the bldg outright free and clear so no mortgage.  Our bridge loan interest is 10%-12%.  So, I did a quick mortgage calc for a $2M loan with 12% interest.  The monthly is about $21k.  It&#39;s a matter of whether she can make her monthly payment or not from her business.  And her income is strictly generated by her business.  She could also rent the bldg out but she choose to run her business instead of renting it.  This is an unusual request.  I know we have 5 data points to pursue, but this is unusual since she only use her loan (once she refi) to pay her judgment lien.  She wants to keep the bldg and her business that&#39;s why she want to get a loan instead of accepting the Coldwell Bankers offer.  Should I pursue this deal (if it&#39;s a deal)?  Her data point is strange. Obviously her &quot;sources and use&quot; is to pay off the lien, and one of her Exit Strategy is to sue (or counter-sue) the people who sued her and gave her the judgment lien, b/c they not only still owed her money but also falsify some legal documents.  She could also rent her bldg out while suing in case her business didn&#39;t pick up b/c she&#39;s still sick and still recuperating.<br><br>Any suggestions will be appreciated.  Thanks.<br><br>Luan        </p>

          just a quick update.  The owner can rent the bldg out for $35k/mo to $40k/mo from the going rate in the neighborhood.  Also, she is in the process to sell an antique painting for $1.5M which can be repaid to principal, but it&#39;ll be in 30 days till she get that money.  Her deadline for the lien (she is foreclosure right now) is late Feb/early Mar.  And she needs to pay it in full not partial.  I begin to think it&#39;s a deal and it&#39;s doable.  It&#39;s just how fast we can quickly turn this around.  Just need your input.  Thanks.        </p>

          Luan,<br>Different people have different appetites so someone out there may find interest in your deal but when reviewing your information I have the following concerns and comments that will hopefully provide you with some value.<br>1) Provide the meat to the deal upfront. Save the narrative or country music song after you&#39;ve given your prospective funding sources something to analyze in a few minutes otherwise there not going to even bother.  Dandrew tends to be a bit more gentle when it comes to this, but the rest of the capital markets will just delete your message and move on, eventually flagging you all together.<br>2) Without getting into too much I&#39;ll stick to the main issue...cash flow.<br>In the current market place those with capital are only concerned with one thing, income producing assets. So if you are going to put weight on any one data point more than anything else it should be income and more importantly net operating income. For example, you provided gross income 3 years ago which to be honest doesn’t mean much, especially when you consider the uncertainty of the actual business she is running (antiques) and the ongoing health concerns.  You then provided the recent gross income of $100k, so at a 10 cap (which is generous) this deal, to a funding source, is only worth $1mm, but that’s gross, the net is obviously less and is the number that matters most, keeping in mind that debt service isn’t calculated in NOI so free and clear or not doesn’t matter, there is still some type of operating expenses, utilities, etc, debt service comes after, which would also kill this deal.  It might be worth more to a prospective buyer who sees a more lucrative use for the property, however an offer doesn’t dictate value and is not the same as an appraisal, which by the way is also, in many cases, meaningless to a funding source.  I could “write” you an offer tomorrow for $10mm, but that doesn’t constitute real market value, unless I actually close, but if there aren’t similar sales at that price level in the area it would likely be considered a one-off sale and not seen as a useable comp.  <br>So without getting into my additional concerns such as small square footage, mom&amp; pop standalone retail, and so on, I don’t think this is a deal for the significant fact that it doesn’t have the cash flow or financials to merit funding.  The only thing that comes to mind is cross-collateral. If the sponsor has other real estate owned or assets that would help hedge the risk of a $2mm loan then maybe you can keep this one alive, but I wouldn’t fall in love with this deal, or any deal for that matter, especially not those short on cash flow. Stick to the numbers in the beginning and make a quick subjective analysis and proceed as necessary from there.<br>However, like I said, that’s just my opinion and how I look at it and in no way means that you couldn’t find a loan based on some other criteria, but I don’t think this is something that is worth a considerable amount of time. Good luck!        </p>

          Thanks Jon for the input.  I wasn&#39;t going to put country music on commercial deals but I thought this case is bit unusual for Dandrew community. So country music may paint a better picture than cold and dry data which you guys will have questions for them later.  Anyway, will try to put more meat and less music next time.<br>But in your opinion, would antique items like paintings be considered as asset for cross collateral?<br>Also, if cash flow from her business is no good, would renting her bldg out at $40k/month be something to think about?  Right now current NOI is shot for most people anyway, but we don&#39;t just look for that in our data point right? If her Exit Strategy is to rent the bldg out and achieve a monthly NOI at $25k or $300k/yr.  Her bldg is in LA and according Marcus and Millichaps it&#39;s about $250/sf right now.  Her bldg is 7000 SF or about $1.75M.  So at 65% LTV it would be about $1.14M.  The question is would anybody be willing to lend $1M+ for a retail single tenant bldg?        </p>

          Luan, this is not the type of deal that Dandrew funds, it would not be worth your time and how would you get paid and would she be able to make her payments? I think you should go to the next deal.         </p>

          Thanks for your input, nursedeb.  Are you a Dandrew employee?  I thought the course says I could make money from origination points (front end) and early termination/pay-off (back end) and interest rate spread.  The owner is making her payment through her current business of selling antique merchandise and interior design contract work.  The backup plan is to rent out the entire bldg which is $35k-$40k/month. She may only need $1M+.        </p>

          Luan, I am a Dandrew student, I would say it sounds ver risky. All you have to do is submit the 5 data points to Sal and he will give you an answer. Good luck. Deb        </p>

          Luan. Thank you for your questions. Dandrew would not look to fund this deal.<br>1) We only consider retail deals that are grocery or pharmacy anchored (the thinking being that we all need to eat and get prescriptions/vitamins etc).<br>2) As Jon points out the estimated value of the asset is well below the loan request.<br>3) Current NOI would not be sufficient to support the debt. <br>4) The lawsuit is against the company and she is looking to leverage her asset to pay the company&#39;s debts. In essence, a cashout refi, whereby the money is going somewhere else and not to the asset (which is what we would look for).  <br>5) We do not like the scenario whereby the owner is the sole tenant of the building. The income of the business is directly proportional to the health of the owner. Would you/your company look to lend this person money knowing that her ability to make repayments depends on her health and ability to sell antiques/interior design work? With the lawsuit and pending foreclosure, this can only add to the stress...<br>6) Cross-collateral - our business is Real Estate and would recommend sticking to this for cross-collateral as we can value it. <br>7) Being able to rent out the remainder of the building seems to be a useful and welcome boost to overall cashflow no? Of course, this depends on the liklihood of her losing the property and how much time she has to complete this (not everyone wishes to work at boosting occupancy if likely to lose the property). If she has been focusing on the business and not had time to do this then she should certainly consider using a professional. <br>I hope that this helps to outline the thinking behind our standpoint.         </p>

          Sal, if you were still funding resi hard money, perhaps you still are on the side, but if the residential hard money was still a primary business for you what markets besides Texas would you have an appetite for funding? Also, what popular investor markets like Indiana or Florida would you stay away from? Thanks for the input. ~ Jon        </p>

          Interesting you&#39;re asking this - now. We&#39;re going to expand our lending to do resi in CA as a buddy of mine just opened a shop (fund) who does nothing but Resi in CA. Once we get this rolled out, we&#39;ll let you know. <br><br>Expect this to happen in mid to late feb.         </p>
