          Sal, I am sure I getting ahead of myself and this is probably addressed in a future model that I don&#39;t yet have access to. Is there way to work with other AskDandrew Intermediaries?  For example let&#39;s say I found interesting properties in a commercial tape and another intermediary is working with a small pension fund or office group and these properties fall into their target buying &quot;wheelhouse&quot;. Would we be able to put the deal, sponsors, and capital together and split the fees? Is there a way work with other intermediaries within the site?  Thanks<br>        </p>

          Sal just so that I understand and can communicate effectively the competitive advantage that Dandrew Partner provides could you clarify with a specific example the difference between providing debt vs providing equity as a capital provider? I am referencing your answer to harkinschan2765 &#39;s comment. Thanks. Love the information and opportunity        </p>

          This is a fantastic question. I am not sure where you are in your modules yet, however, I will tell you that our special sauce is the ability to structure financing products around any deal. We do not believe that every deal has a “one-size-fits-all” solution to it and sponsors have different needs. <br>I’ll offer a few examples here of some projects we’ve funded or are far into talks with: <br><br>1.	*Someone who buys a lot of MF or Warehouses.* They can source deals well through relationships. Dandrew can provide them a “Line of Equity” to take down these assets fast so they can improve them and later take us out with conventional financing.<br><br>2.	*Someone who needs to take down a retail asset*. They already have the debt lined up elsewhere, but they need equity (“down payment money, but *don’t ever use that term*) to make the improvements so a Walgreens can move in. This is where Dandrew can come in. <br><br>3.	*Someone has been offered to buy their note back at a discount.* They need debt. This is a glorified short sale - *but don’t ever use that term either, you know what I mean*. Dandrew can provide bridge debt to execute this sale quickly. <br><br>4.	People who have found something interesting to buy but don’t have all of the info they need, Dandrew can structure a solution around their deal. <br>        </p>

          So in essence Dandrew is a G to the O to the D  shizniz in this bidniz.  I&#39;m paraphrasing of course.  Can&#39;t wait to start getting deals over to you and I&#39;ll bring my glasses so I have them.        </p>

          Sal, I am probably getting ahead and this is probably answered in detail in a future module. Is there a way to work with other Dandrew intermediaries to do more deals for example. I find some interesting Valued Added Commercial Tape and another Dandrew intermediary has a relationship with a small pension group or office group and this property is in their buying &quot;wheelhouse&quot;. Would be able to work together putting the deal, buyers, and capital together and split the fees?  Is there a network board on way to do that within the site?        </p>

          I am not sure it is a good . You have an office in LV so I am sure you  and your team have a better idea of stabilized values and cap rates. I could not tell if  Dandrew is funding these deals with an assumed CMBS loan and new equity needed or not? Would you consider deals if not what terms would make it attractive for funding? What is the best way to structure it? Thanks        </p>

          Timothy,<br><br>Then why did you submit it? Just because we have an office in Las Vegas?<br><br>Here&#39;s an idea for you: <br><br>*Why don&#39;t you read some of the materials you purchased - instead of trying to chargeback your purchases from 6 months ago that you bought from us.

Why I would want to trust you as an intermediary at this point after doing this?  If I can&#39;t trust you to hold to your obligations, how can I trust you to tell your borrowers what we want on a deal? *And your LinkedIn profile you&#39;re disputing the charge of sure looks like you DIDN&#39;T write it either...*<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal my credit cards were hacked and stolen. One of the accounts has several cards so there were thousands of charges of several card holders that had to be reviewed over a  6 month span. There were numerous charges that the bank reversed that were legitimate as well as many that were not and I have had to  try to prove painstakingly what were authorized charges and bills over a  4-6 month period. It has reeked havoc on my personal finances as I have had to repay legitimate vendors and then argue and submit to the bank and CC company to  try to get reimbursed or credited for the charge that was incorrectly reversed. I would prefer that you email me  or have a staff contact me about the specifics rather than lashing out at me through this forum. I have gone through the materials and put them into action more than 90% of your intermediaries and I am a pull yourself by your boot straps  person but  I don&#39;t appreciate the swipe feels like you kicking someone when they are down. You offer great and material and lots of help I will chalk this up to maybe a bad day at the office. Again I apologize but this has created more of hardship on me and my family than you and there was no intent to . Thanks again for the support . I have had the same linked profile way before I signed up for the program I did write it  and joined Linlkedin because Jason Lucchessi of  Asset Manager Millionaires who you know well recommended to do so as a part of his program in 2012 that I purchased at that time.        </p>

          Timothy<br><br>I’m not saying I believe you, but I’m not saying I don’t believe you. Having been in that position before, you don’t just do wholesale chargebacks. You blatantly lied about charges which were fraudulent to begin with and that put us in harm with our merchant. Your story doesn’t make sense. And yes, we all have had hardships. Everyone on this forum and their brother-in-law have had hardships. <br><br>But I guess everyone today in America is a victim of some hardship which gives them permission to do unethical things. <br><br>If you write a letter to the help desk (admin@dandrewpartners.com) telling them why you did this before Thursday,  I may be willing to extend the olive branch, as it stands now I have no idea how you got access to AskDandrew if you’ve been on the no fly list for doing this. I’ll retract my post. <br><br>I am not afraid to slash and burn those who do harm to the organization, our Intermediaries and employees.

          Sal I sent a deal through the deal site a few days ago  I have not heard anything. It is a value add income producing complex. At 65% occupancy is at a 9 cap rate. There is no existing deb stack. It needs renovation to reach max value potential and I assumed total renovation of all 256 units at 12K  per unit and doubled the expenses. The current rents are on average $300 per unit per month below the market rents.  The icing on the cake is that the complex is a condominium property so an exit could be after raising the occupancy, rents, and value and holding the property for 2 to 3 years to separate the units  and sell all or part of the units individually. Let me know your feedback on the deal hopefully you can find it the system. Thanks        </p>

          Friday. Here is the 5 data points. 1. NOI:  At 65% occupancy there is gross NOI of 1240800. I have all the fees except for  I getting info on if there is management fee being paid. I assumed a high rate of 10% when generating a NOI while I wait for confirmation from the ownership parties. With these conservative assumptions I have a current NOI of 836,720<br>   Projected NOI: This is based on assumption of achieving 90% occupancy and increasing the rents to market area levels which are about $300 per month per unit below the current area. I doubled the expenses that calculated for the current net NOI but did not include debt service. The projected NOI is 1,503,040<br>2 NO Debt presently on property<br>3. Sources and Uses Purchase and Rehab at  8.8MM I assumed a purchase price of 5.3.MM and assumed 3,5MM in renovations and that every unit  needed  I have been told that most of the units that are occupied 165 units of the 256 only need about 4-5k and 91 units which are not occupied needed 12k in rehab. I just assumed that every unit needs 13,671.88 in repairs. <br>4. 65% occupancy<br>5. Exit refinance and hold. Sell to investor once re positioned at 90% occupancy. Hold for cash flow and sell part or all on the units as individualized condo units which they can be divided back into under the provisions. The property is located near a local college and a building burnt down several years ago containing 10 units. This building could be re-built and units could be place back into service at  $600-$800 or an additional 70k in gross income. <br>        </p>

          Timothy<br><br>Let’s slow down here. <br><br>*1.  I have all the fees except for I getting info on if there is management fee being paid.*<br>What are “fees” that you’re talking about? Who is calculating this Current NOI? You? No. That should come from the sponsor. <br><br>*2. Where is this property located?* <br>$300/month is like trailer park rents. Is this Class C? They better have a management company. <br><br>*3. Who is buying and operating this? Do you have a copy of their bios?* <br><br>Not worried about the burnt down building yet. That is just gravy if it comes into fruition. <br><br>Bottom line: too many assumptions. So this is not close to being buttoned down. Answer my 3 questions and lets see where we are with this. <br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          The average rent is 600 per unit because of unit mix. There are only twenty one bedroom unit at 350 per month. The three bedroom units are renting for 650 a month and the two bedroom 450. I doing whatever it takes to find deals and line them up with multifamily operators to make this work. I can&#39;t and don&#39;t have the luxury to wait for sponsors  I don&#39;t have a specific one lined up I am talking to a few looking for deals and funding that this deal fits in their wheelhouse and connecting the dots. I will have some executive summaries of interested sponsors by the end of the week. These sponsors have their own rehab crews and management. Additionally I gave the resources to facfacilitate the rehab work and subs I was a GC in Georgia for several years and have established relationships wi quality vendors and subs I have known for 15 years. The project is in Clarkston ga just outside Atl. I got the numbers on the deal from the seller and their representative I just inflated the rehab budget and expenses to  make sure it would still be a good deal and sellers understate things to make deal more appealing we all know that.        </p>

          how are you funding deals at starting at 5% and 6%? What deals are being funded at that rate? Is there any allowance for seller carry back on multi family? and lastly how much would discount the value of property that has occupancy but the tenants are month to month rather than on a lease?        </p>

          The DIP Scripts talk about setting a meeting up with a manager with the Chapter 11 financing decision maker. I have the info and list to call but want to confirm how and when we set these meeting ups I presume with you or AJ with the Law firms. Right now I feel like I am all dressed up but with no where to party. Let me know if there is a calender or how we know good times to set up these meeting. Thanks        </p>

          Sal<br>I just finished the mezzanine and preferred equity program. It was very useful. I felt a critical elemeny was missing. I would like to see a case study that shows how a multi family property with ref lock out can be structured with preferred equity to enable an investor to get equity out the property to invest in another deal. I think this is a huge opportunity but I need to know how it would work or could be done. Thanks Timothy        </p>

          Timothy. <br><br>We will do a Pref or Mezz (or both) Case Study during the next Continuing Ed. The program you purchased was designed to give you a *fundamental overview* of the structured finance product. <br>Specifically, how it works, what the remedies are, and rights. <br><br>This will be up for a month and then it will be moved over to the pref system contents. As we do with all video content, we will place these in their respective buckets after the fact so users can reference them later. <br><br>The uses can be manifold, hence, I&#39;ve reached out to one of my competitor friends to get a copy of an actual case study as we&#39;ve not issued a t/s on this year but just gotten this approval for this type of product and the boundaries are still being defined. <br><br>(Although AJ had one last year that would have been great on the Sales Desk Espionage program, the sponsor went back to the middle east and dropped off the face of the earth.)<br><br>In the worst case scenario, I can do a case study using the term sheet for our OFREEFund.com fund that we&#39;re winding down. That was preferred equity. <br><br>We will make sure this is discussed for everyone&#39;s benefit. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Sal<br><br>I didn&#39;t know there was a land  development program. An old contact of mine referred  me to a huge 400+ acre development  track  in the  Bullhead City/Lake Mohave/Laughlin MSA.  I have docs easements, HOA docs, right ways, land use, land use , the previous contract offer that fellow through etc . I know there is reservation on land deals or development deals but the basis is so low per acre ($800 an acre on 9000 square foot home site!!! )  the opportunities appear be unreal with plenty of  room to structure and JV with Bull Head/Laughlin developer. I know you are Vegas connected and very versatile and upfront.  Can talk to you to see what can be structured?  I have access to other really great land opportunities through reaching out to some old contacts. They have fallen into my lap and  they are hard money fall outs from the Boom period. I have plenty of docs from the deal when it was supposed to close for your review. I am not from the area and do not have the resources to work this out but you a knowledge trustworthy source and I want to learn and need your help. Please let me know the best way to get in touch with you and send the info. Thanks        </p>

          Timothy: <br><br>This is not what Land Developement Financier was designed for. This is not in our wheelhouse, and not in anyone&#39;s wheelhouse that I know of in my industry circles. Developing lizard and snake territory isn&#39;t going to excite anyone. I&#39;ve seen too many of these deals blow up and that was the point behind the OFREEFund.com. <br><br>There is nothing special about this area. We&#39;re not interested. <br><br>Sal        </p>
