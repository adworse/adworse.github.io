          Sal,<br>I shared this in my email a few minutes ago, wanted to include it here. Recently, I&#39;ve put the word out that I raise capital for commercial projects to commercial real estate brokers, commercial property managers and others and my emails go crazy and my phone rings all the time.<br><br>People need what we have and the fact they don&#39;t have to go through a lengthy application and need only provide answers to the five data points is very enticing.<br><br>We make it very easy for them to save time by not having to waste time with traditional funders.

          Sal,<br>I have a call this week with a firm that buys pools of NPN, PN and Re-Performing notes. Quick questions, on the Re-performing notes, the fact that they added the delinquent balance onto the back end of the note, does that make more valuable or less valuable. More valuable in terms of the over all yield increasing and less valuable because it was already delinquent. In reality all they have to go by is someone&#39;s promise they will straighten up and fly right.<br><br>My next question is that isn&#39;t it required so as to not violate SEC rules that the very first meeting or call cannot discuss specific business as there must be a previous business relationship created before discussing money?        </p>

          Sal, as requested and promised, here is the link to the Bloomberg article I sent over to you. I will give you my insight into where I think the play is going to be. <br><br>*The link is http://bloom.bg/1b3UpSh .*<br><br>The play for this is going to be in the smaller markets outside of the Tier-1 Cities such as Tier-2 Cities and those areas with a MSA of 500,000 or more.<br>These big white elephant firms are looking to position themselves into Tier-1 cities even if they say they consider plays in smaller cities because if they have an opportunity to buy a class B asset in a class A area, for them it&#39;s a major score and they look brighter in the eyes of those institutional investors that capitalize their funds.<br>The play is also going to be those smaller size assets/deals in the investment range of Dandrew. The bigger firms are not looking at the smaller deals as they are geared towards the larger properties that were trading in the hundred million dollar sector when market conditions were in its hey day.<br>There is going to be a demand for properties that are in the lower price points that over time will go up in value faster than the higher priced properties. Because these firms are buying where they are at price ponies wise, they are leaving no room for the value add component to come into play.<br><br>If I&#39;m paying $50,000,000.00 for a property even though it&#39;s still a great deal versus what it was trading for historically and it&#39;s in a Tier-1 and your paying $18 million for a similar property in a Tier-2, your in a much better value add position because you have a market location that may go up in value faster and your investment has greater potential to grow significantly.        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>I have a question for you. Have bank balance sheets healed and recovered from the financial crisis? I found this recent news article on National Real Estate Investor that is of the opinion that it has &quot;largely healed&quot; (Anderson, 2014):<br><br>&quot;You might not think of commercial banks as a prime source for longer-term loans—but seven-year terms have become common for commercial mortgages provided from the balance sheets of banks eager to lend, especially on multifamily properties. “Banks are very aggressively out there and bidding on loans,” says Michael Riccio, senior managing director for CBRE Capital Markets. Bank balance sheets have now largely healed from the financial crisis. Also, new banks regulations go ...&quot; (Anderson, 2014)<br><br>If this is true, how will this affect the market for balance sheet solutions; and would this require intermediaries to adjust business development strategies to the new market reality?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Suzette<br><br>References:<br><br>Anderson, B. (2014, February 2). Commercial Banks Push to Place Permanent Loans on Multifamily Properties.

          Great article, Suzette. <br><br>However, this is in a trade magazine, which is like reading articles on the best mutual funds in Forbes, turning the page and seeing that the advertisers are Fidelity and Vanguard. <br><br>Or like Miami real estate brokers telling you Miami is a hot market right now because the uber-luxury condos are being bid up. But they&#39;re not telling you that it&#39;s foreign oligarchs buying these to park their money because the NAR doesn&#39;t have a &quot;know your client rule&quot; so Saddam Hussein could buy one if he was alive today. <br><br>Not indicative of what is really going on. <br><br>My issue with this today is as follows: yes banks are lending. The problem is that few commercial banks will make commercial real estate loans in excess of 58% to 63% loan-to-value today.  Even if you could convince a bank to make you a loan of $1,575,000 (63% of $2.5 million), the proceeds of the loan won&#39;t be enough to pay off your $1,950,000 existing first mortgage. <br><br>So rest assured, private capital (preferred equity and mezzanine) will still be as useful as water is to a fish. <br><br>Always read between the lines. Stay cynical. Be paranoid at worst. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I live in the Dallas area and there are banks here that will make you a commercial loan as long as you have 30 to 40 % of your own equity to pledge to the deal. They also want to tie up the deal for 45 to 60 days.<br><br>Our USP or Unique Selling Proposition is that we are deal makers who don&#39;t make a borrower wait months to maybe get a deal done, probably not. There is the argument from borrowers that our interest rate is not low, the reply is this is not 2007 anymore. The next argument is going to be that they can get a lower interest, lower points and a higher LTV elsewhere. The reply is is that a true LTV or is it LTC? How much lower interest rate and points and they will often tell you and the reply is that if they could have done that, they wouldn&#39;t be entertaining doing business with us and they would have already signed off on the term sheet.<br><br>The best argument for our interest rate is high is well if you can get 10% elsewhere versus our 13%, what&#39;s the trade off? Wait upwards of 60 days to save 3% points that are being paid for by the properties income not the sponsor-operators wallet anyway.<br><br>I find that you have to help a sponsor-operator be able to justify doing business with us. I always use the a Doctor Analogy when someone says that they can walk into a bank and get a loan. The analogy is as follows. I know a very financially strong doctor who has a credit score of 800 and he couldn&#39;t obtain a mortgage loan so while you may be able to go in and apply, there&#39;s a good chance you will not get a loan, so we are your best chance in today&#39;s market and I always ask, does this make sense.        </p>

          Jimmy<br><br>I see the USP. But I want you to think of the risk. <br><br>*Sal&#39;s Rule: The risks are always more asymmetric than you think.* <br><br>The reason why I&#39;m able to cultivate capital - *on demand* - in most cases is because I have a reputation of thinking through the risks first that I use to pre-qualify the deal/play before I raise captial around it. <br><br>What can go wrong. How do I manage it. Once I figure that out, my conviction in the deal is must stronger and hence, for lack of a better term, so to is my &quot;passion&quot; for communicating that to any investor. <br><br>I think that if you look at in Private Equiteer &quot;Sal&#39;s Live Pitch&quot; tab, you&#39;ll see that. <br><br>If I was reading from a teleprompter, what would that say about my conviction in the deal. I don&#39;t mean conviction means &quot;hype&quot;. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          The risks are always going to that the debt will not be repaid as agreed and that the value of the asset will go down in value based upon the market conditions, leaving us with an asset that if foreclosed upon, would not allow us to recover the principle.<br><br>One of the biggest problems I see in the Dallas market for example is with big box retailers expanding into an area of town where for example, there is a strip mall that may have a clothes store, a restaurant, a mom and pop pharmacy with a small well established Hispanic grocery as the anchor tenant.<br><br>All along, for years, the owners of the strip mall saw huge rental Incomes come because the leases were structured as a nnn deal, and the stores were riding high due to huge market share, however, when Wal Mart and Sams Club moved in, all of a sudden, the tenants saw a huge decline in revenues, they couldn&#39;t afford rents and utilities, marketing dollars declined, and the businesses shut their doors one by one and this great nnn structured deal all of a sudden became like a straight rental situation. <br><br>No new stores were lining up because no one wants to try to run up against Wal Mart and Sams. I believe if we structure the terms of the loan carefully, we require more equity in the deal thus eliminating the amount of monies lent and we build a term sheet around the concept of turn over the deed in lieu of foreclosure, we eliminate the time involvement to go through the foreclosure process and cost.<br><br>If we manage client expectations well from the start, we all enter into this deal with a firm understanding of the terms of the deal, we cross collateralize with an asset that is free and clear, we have a second asset we can take that off sets any potential losses and actually makes the deal profitable.<br><br>We sell both assets as a package deal and increase our yield because were co mingling a strong asset with a weak asset, beefing up the value of the deal to a new owner. We take a equity stake in the new deal that gives us extra protection.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is a portion of the REO Report I just emailed you. I wanted to post it so those here can see where the opportunities truly are.<br><br>While the top 5 banks still own most of the non-performing debt and REO there continue to be thousands of local, community, and regional banks carrying and disposing of these distressed assets.<br><br>One of the big opportunities for 2014 is going to be the small balance distressed commercial real estate notes and properties with smaller lenders.<br><br>During the boom the smaller banks went long into construction and local commercial real estate lending because it was impossible for them to compete with the larger residential lenders.<br><br>Now as regulators turn up the heat on our nation’s smaller banks, strangling them with the burden of increased regulations, it has become even more important for them to shed their most criticized non-accrual and the easiest place for them to do that is in their commercial portfolio.<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick comment about The Perfect Storm. This should be a resource in every IM&#39;s tool chest. It is in my opinion a worthwhile 119 page booklet.<br><br>I fully understand what&#39;s it purpose is however there is lots of valuable information in it for anyone to read. I really appreciated the candor in the section in why Dandrew needs us. It sheds light on the subject.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I reviewed your reply to my fund formation question but did not see where I could reply, so I wanted to answer the very good questions you posed which I did take into account.<br><br>First, the funds monies are always protected because the sponsor operator would not be given a blank check so to speak, the funds would be placed into escrow and held until certain caveats are performed such as end buyer providing their funds to close on the B-C transaction whether the closing date is 24 hours or 30 days from close of escrow for the A-B transaction.<br><br>The funds attorney would handle all legal including filing suits if need be and the costs for legal would be born out of the funds operating capital. The losing party would reimburse the fund<br><br>The earnest money would be held in escrow until the close of the A-B and the funds monies would not be in jeopardy because it would always be in the closing segments hands until the deal closed. If the deal does not close, all monies advanced by the fund would be returned.<br>The fund would be given a equity stake in each property or note/note pool until the monies were repaid, this way, in the event extended transaction funds came into play as opposed to 24 hour short term and not repaid, the fund would foreclose on the asset or assets and liquidate to return to the investors their monies.<br><br>The mission of the fund is to make available commercial real estate secured short term to medium term investment opportunities where the investors money is always working and generating returns on a daily to monthly basis as opposed to the stock market or hard money lending which ties up an investors money for six months to twelve months gaining interest only monthly payments . <br><br>Through my fund, they are receiving one check that reflects profits from multiple closed transactions monthly thus generating a higher return on investment.         </p>

          It would be about 30 days. There isn&#39;t a such thing as a 24 hours close in commercial; the grown-ups live in this realm and its caveat emptor. Not like residential where a Realtor&#39;s license or brokerage is on the line. <br><br>How would the fund foreclose if it is just providing earnest money? There is no ownership? You mean if held in an LLC? Foreclose on the membership interests? <br><br>You may be onto something here - albeit some would consider predatory - and only the marginally experienced real estate investor would do this out of some form of desperation. I&#39;m not saying its wrong, there is a cost to everything.  <br><br>Get back to me on this.         </p>

          Sal,<br>As you are aware I am shortly going to be elevating myself to the Private Equiteer level with Dandrew within a few weeks with this being a very exciting time in my career. My goal as you know from our previous conversations is to be a fund manager.<br><br>In your very valued opinion what is the viability of a fund that provides transactional funding monies to experienced sponsor operators in the commercial sector, with the food groups being multi family and notes?<br><br>This would be short term funds with the max term being 180 days or less, thus allowing the fund and its contributing members to turn their monies every six months, thus earning a higher yield versus putting their monies into longer term investments.<br><br>Would the unique selling proposition be the short term higher yield opportunities or would it be to become involved with commercial opportunities without having to acquire properties.<br><br>As always, thank you for your time        </p>

          Sal,<br>As you know transactional funding companies direct their marketing target demographic at residential single family 1 to 4 unit property types putting up 100% of the funds to acquire plus closing costs for generally a 1 to 3 day period for generally 2% fee plus a processing fee to cover soft costs. They say they do commercial but you never see anything geared toward this. You can&#39;t blame them, they are small deal market makers for the most part.<br><br>My idea is to do do a special situation type equity fund using the transactional funding model, where the sponsor-operator would have an investment, say a multi family that they can acquire from a bank for lets say 45 cents on the dollar, quickly clean up and quick turn to a multi family investment company for 65 cents on the dollar.<br><br>They would keep the money out for lets say 56 days at 8% as an extended transactional funding . The makeup of the sponsor operator is that they have done 2 or 3 small deals, no joint venture partner readily available because the track record just is not there, they have a small network of buyers who want the sponsor-operator to take title first as opposed to the end  buyer having to do all the heavy lifting and not wanting to buy the deal as a result of a referral, in other words, they want the sponsor-operator to work the deal.<br><br>The sponsor-operator would never get past the vetting by Dandrew or most reputable capital providers. The fund would place the acquisition monies plus closing costs into escrow like any transactional funder does, have their monies constantly working over many deals. The sponsor-operator would use their own funds to get the deal ready for the end buyer to come in.<br><br>The fund would receive back the principle plus fees. The fund investors would receive a premium on their money over a mutual fund investment because their monies would be moving in and out of deals monthly and weekly as opposed to letting the monies ride in the stock market on the stable one day unstable the next roller coaster called the stock markets.<br><br>Is something like this viable in your opinion?        </p>

          Quick comment about Linked In. If someone is trying to connect with an asset manager and gets to talking with them about doing business, they are going to ask you for a proof of funds and a LOI to get anywhere with them.<br><br>You must reinforce that your not a buyer, you are a funding resource for those buyers who want to do business with them. This is a great way to gain referral business. Referral business up keeps your deal pipeline full at zero customer acquisition costs.<br><br>When you let serious players know you have access to money especially hedge fund money from such funds as a Dandrew, you gain their undivided attention because most people in the funding business do not readily get success to this type of money, this is shy you cannot put a price on the connection to Sal Buscemi and Dandrew that you have.<br><br>Learn to understand that, and if you think it&#39;s easy to gain access to hedge fund money, try calling other hedge funds. Call HBK in Dallas and see how far you get, it won&#39;t be very far. <br><br>So learn the value of what you have and get serious about this business, you don&#39;t get very many opportunities of this stature in your career.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Something quick here before a meeting. I read the ebook about the Art of The Raise that preceded the release of your book, which I just saw the link in my email from Lee Arnold.<br><br>If the book is anything like the small 29 or so page ebook, this book is going to really open the eyes of so many people, in the business. You have hit a home run as always.<br><br>I for one appreciate everything your doing for us. By next year, I will have every program you have available. Anyway if your wondering where I got the ebook, I got it from a link in your Facebook page, so yes, I cheated.<br><br>One more quick question. I have decided to form a LLC in Nevada and obtain a virtual office in Las Vegas. Is there an advantage to forming a family LLC, so I can make this a family business, provide for the kids and form a trust for them, so out of every deal, they benefit, or would a professional LLC be better.<br><br>OMG one more thing as I am hyped up today on a potential deal for us. You mentioned on the call with Lee Arnold about following in his footsteps with a test of some kind. Have you thought about taking all your programs, putting them all together, charging a fee of say $5,000.00, financing it over 6 months or extending it to one year if they are willing to agree to a 50/50 split of all fees and yield spreads for the year. Also they must pass a certification test to be eligible to do deals with you.        </p>

          I realize that properties must be in tier 1 or 2 cities.  Do the small banks and hard money lenders I get REO&#39;s etc from also need to be in Tier 1 or 2 cities?  Is a small city within the greater Orlando/Seattle, or whatever, area acceptable as a tier 1 city?          </p>

          Jeraldine. <br><br>Absolutely not. I’ve seen lenders in Tampa lend in Detroit. Orlando is a great city. So is Seattle. <br><br>The Tier 1 are great. But you’re going to see more action in Tier 2 Cities. <br><br>Sal <br>        </p>

          Jeraldine, if I may comment. Tier 1 cities are great to work in and Sal is correct about Tier 2 Cities. In the program it is mentioned about MSA of 500,000 people in an area.<br><br>If you go down to City Hall in most cities in this country and speak to the planning dept, most have a report available that discusses which banks are coming to town and when. Banks spent ridiculous amounts of money on demographic studies to see if an area is going to explode with new commercial and residential construction.<br><br>They are like big box retailers, they are not going to spend money to establish business operations if the business is not there. Smaller banks will often liquidate notes, performing or not to create capital to invest, so you may find plenty of banks in this position.<br><br>If you look at most new development, there I&#39;d always a nice fancy sign out that says this project financed by such and such bank. They said financed, they never said mortgaged. Banks could be going into that project as a joint venture participant.<br><br>In addition, these signs often list the developer. Some of these developers may actually need money for a project such as student housing or may have build a residential development, carried notes to make a deal happen and are now looking to cash out.<br><br>I&#39;ve known many developers who developed a residential development on purpose, became the bank and carried paper with the goal of liquidating that paper and getting very cheap money to build a commercial development that gives them a return on investment that cannot be measured.<br><br>The cheapest money is always going to be money not borrowed.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was on the Lee Arnold presentation this evening and I wanted to say thank you for inviting me and no I did not do it for a copy of your new book, I did it because you invited me. This is one way to show respect for someone and this is a segway into a few comments for the new people.<br><br>My sister in law went to Wharton and worked for several financial institutions in a 32 year financial career. She worked for B of A, UBS and a wealth management concern in Dallas before passing away at Christmas 2013.<br><br>*When I first came on board at Dandrew as a banking program IM, I let her see the program and she asked me if I paid $25,000.00 to $60,000.00 to Dandrew and when I told her the price she said wow.<br><br>I asked why that response and her answer is worth people seeing. She said that the education in the videos, the concepts in the infographics, the continued training is a MBA quality education wrapped in one package. She said people that work on the street are not privy to the strategies and profitunities you make available, unless they are either a fund manager or account manager.*<br><br>Now I did not take advantage of Lee&#39;s program this evening, only because right now I am heavily focused on my future with Dandrew and Private Equity, Banking and Arbs.<br><br>Here is the point of this long comment and people need to understand what comes next. A finance degree will take you 4 to 7 years to fully obtain at a cost of $40,000.00 plus and you will start at the bottom as part of a team somewhere, with constricted responsibility until you break out and make a name through bringing in the big white elephant clients, very much like Charlie Sheens character in the first Wall Street movie. You will have to produce in order to be given the opportunity to leverage yourself into opportunities.<br><br>How much does it cost to be involved with the various programs Sal offers, $397 to $1500.00 and what&#39;s the value immediately provided? PRICELESS!!!. What are your options in lieu of doing business with Sal?<br><br>You can sit and watch tv, drink your drinks, eat your snacks and watch life pass you by. You can go out and get a job where you trade time for dollars and when you get that W2 at the end of year say Only if I, or you can invest in yourself and a financially successful future by going through the program your in, pickup a phone, call a commercial real estate broker and say I have money to deploy that is for time sensitive opportunities, do you or your clients needs funds for a opportunistic deal?<br><br>I am not a sales man I&#39;m a deal engineer but it wasn&#39;t long ago that I was that guy sitting on the couch, the guy working my rear off 75 hours a week for the wages of a guy who someone told what he&#39;s worth to the company and it was by chance that I saw a sponsored ad on Facebook that bought me to Sals front door.<br><br>Sal I will be seeing you at the top very soon.        </p>

          Sal, <br>Quick two questions...1) Will Dandrew be creating anything in terms of presentations for the IPad as well as an app<br><br>2) I looked at your bookmarks list and have secured many if those books and publications listed, are there any specific IPad apps you use or can recommend        </p>

          Sal-<br>As always I find myself thinking my best at 0300 am for some reason. I wanted to pass this piece of wisdom onto those that are new here and equally new to this great business we are in.<br><br>If you can get the basics of how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together, you will learn to see opportunity around every corner, it is like a sixth sense, after awhile.<br><br>In the Private Banker program which is the level 1 program, you have many profit centers available to you. If you learn not to over think things, which then leads you to paralysis of analysis, and you don&#39;t prejudge any opportunity, you will learn very fast that you will be able to say, how can I help this sponsor-operator or how can I make money with this deal, and begin to use the power of what Sal and Dandrew is making available to you for your success.        </p>

          Sal-<br>As always I like to preface my comments where I am not trying to be the teacher. I wanted to pass on some recent observations I have seen in the commercial real estate funding arena and niche from the intermediary stand point and this is predominately a comment for those that are new.<br><br>First, you will as you get out into the marketplace come across individuals who call themselves intermediaries. Anyone can hang out their shingle and call themselves intermediaries like some call themselves real estate investors who never write the check to be an investor in a deal.<br><br>Unless that individual calling themselves an intermediary has been trained by Sal and the team at Dandrew, then they are not an intermediary, they are a joker-broker and if you ask them enough questions and really listen to their answers, you will come to realize that they are truly not someone you want to extend the olive branch to. I say this because if they are joker brokers, operating under joker broker principles and market place strategies from 2007 when the business changed, then the deals they have will be for the most part, not realistic, will not have experienced sponsor operators with realistic expectations who have the earnest money deposit and additional equity required to leverage a position into a tangible deal and you will waste your time and next to intellectual capital, time is one of your most prized possessions in this business.<br><br>Sal talks about credibility a lot and you must be credible. Your deals must be credible and you must have the tools to be considered credible. We as intermediaries bring the deal and Dandrew brings the funds to the deal and the work we do as Intermediaries, the heavy lifting we do is what justifies our earning a fee for services and a piece of the pie. I don&#39;t know about you but $3000 to $8000 per month as a spread income for 12 months is enough to keep you and me away from punching a time clock and making someone else rich off our efforts.<br><br>You can run around and chase after deals like an idiot, wondering why you have no deal flow or you can go after the business that is out there intelligently, dealing with the players who have real deals. Sal will say to you that it is against the firms policy that they do not deal with brokered deals.<br><br>When you hear this phrase from a Funder such as Sal, he is talking about deals that come from those untrained people running around and calling themselves brokers.<br><br>You will come to see these guys and gals as you become more ingrained into the space we are operating in. These are those Brokers who present a deal to you that has a price that is usually not realistic or feasible with the key words plus 3%. This is a red flag that is waving with a banner attached so to speak that says move on to someone who is real.<br><br>Deals you get from Attorneys, CPA&#39;s, Real Estate Advisory Firms, and those Commercial Real Estate Brokers and Brokerage Firms who are house hold names such as Marcus and Millichap to name one are going to be deals where the players are real, they are experienced and have the financial capability and savvy to understand a term sheet that they may get from Dandrew.<br><br>In my recent discussions with these types of people, I have come to realize that once they see that we have the goods, meaning we have the intellectual capital to play on their level and we can bring real funds from a real and well known funding firm meaning Dandrew, and we are not a fly by night wanna be with no clue how deals flow from origination to closing, we will be invited to the game and once you show you can perform and your a results driven intermediary, we will be invited back to the party and be invited to even bigger deals.<br><br>My point here is that you have no reason not to look at the videos, study the infographics, come here and ask questions and get out there and do this business. $97.00 a month does not seem like a lot of money and it isn&#39;t however it begins to cost you money when your not taking what Sal teaches and putting to work your intellectual capital.        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>It is my understanding that AJ has started a fund for the purpose of acquiring NNN deals. I am all of a sudden seeing these deals come to me from the Commercial Real Estate Brokerages representing the Principal Sellers. Here are my questions:  What are they specifically looking for in terms of property types, are they required to be in Tier-1 Cities, what is the MSA requirements, what cap rates are they looking for, Will they buy single property opportunities or portfolio transactions only or both.<br><br>In addition, are the properties required to be free standing buildings or can they be in strip malls and if they are in strip malls, does this change the dynamics of the transaction because of operating costs factored into the operating expenses? Also, can the properties have underlying debt in placer that needs to be paid off or paid down?        </p>

          Sal:<br>Recently I mentioned that actively seeking note deals is not in my wheelhouse and your reply was don&#39;t rule out seeing these sincethe marketplace is flooded with deals on NPN firsts, re-performing firsts, etc.<br><br>I started thinking, why is the marketplace not full of second position notes being actively marketed and the only answer I could arrive at is that not many understand that there are buyers for seconds.<br><br>In your opinion, if someone was to actively market for these and word got around that there is someone looking, how likely would it be to see deal flow?<br><br>In addition, are you looking for commercial, residential or both? Will Dandrew buy individual notes or strictly pools because of the risk levels involved such as Chapter 13 BK, etc.<br><br>My last question is this. If a commercial note holder files for BK and lists the notes in that filing, would it get filed as a chapter 13 or 7?<br><br>        </p>

          These are great questions and I&#39;m happy to answer them. <br><br>We like seconds. But it requires expertise to understand them. Expertise that most of the students in this industry and the flakey broker (*with the exception for trained Dandrew Intermediaries, of course*) don’t have. <br><br>If you’re an Arbitrager or a member of AskDandrew Silver, then you know how these are done and the later are actively submitting seconds to us. <br><br>*Sal’s Rule: You can’t control the types of deals you see, just the amount of deal flow you see.* <br><br>And regarding your BK question: Yes it would be placed on the BK filing as being a *secured creditor* - and that is the reason why commercial lenders don&#39;t like seconds behind firsts, although they do exist. <br><br>There&#39;s a toolkit for that: <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathnifif <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal:<br>I&#39;ve been paying attention to everything you discuss. Downloaded the book on 6 questions to ask a seller of Bulk Assets, I thought of a 7th question. It is this...If I get into a call with the seller of the assets and ask them if they know you and if you were the very first person they talked to about this deal, what are they going to tell me...<br><br>I&#39;ve been approached about a lot of bulk asset deals lately, 100. 0 % crap and definitely not worth embarrassing myself in front of you on and losing credibility! I&#39;ve used this question with all of them and have smoked out the fact that none of these wanna be&#39;s were even direct.        </p>

          See. That book saved you aggravation, time, and most importantly, *it saved you from getting discouraged*. <br><br>Don&#39;t ask them if they know me. That is lifting your skirt up over your head on the first date. <br><br>Rather say the following:<br><br>*How many other qualified institutions have you shown this too. Who are they? I know most of them.*. <br><br>They will probably not tell you but you will intimidate them enough to stumble if they are legit or not. <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Oops I should have clarified this. I ask the one trying to get a deal in front of me who tells me oh yea yea I&#39;m direct, I ask that seventh question, If I get on the phone with the seller and ask them if they know you, meaning the one pitching me the deal, what are they going to tell me about your relationship with them.<br><br>I just sent a guy a email and put the 6 questions to him and the seventh too, because he was telling me that before I can see the due diligence documents I need to provide a bank issued POF, a non binding LOI and their attorney would need to review this first.<br><br>My reply back was I do not provide these documents until I see the deal. I stated if your seller is serious about selling, they should have no issues providing enough docs to see if were even interested in moving forward.<br><br>Truth of the matter is that if this is an IM, I&#39;m not going to provide a POF that can be used to secure the deal by locking it up with the seller and then getting the deal docs and putting me/ us into the deal as the B to C second party.<br><br>Sal I&#39;ve learned back in the early days on Wall Street that you deal directly with the decision makers not the gate keeper and his/her crew.        </p>

          Some questions: <br><br>1. I don’t know what you mean by “what are they going to tell me about your relationship with them.” Who’s who here? <br><br>2. If he wants an LOI and POF, you’re dealing with a broker who is bullshitting you. Period. <br><br>I told you to be direct, if you’re not direct, you’re wasting time and will not be successful in this business. Sorry to be harsh, but better you learn now than later after you get discouraged and disenchanted with what I think is a wonderful business. <br><br>Besides, is he really going to pay a lawyer to review this? You have to be kidding me. Lawyers never get involved in these deals unless it’s being structured as a syndication (Reg D). <br><br>More broker tough talk for stuff that will never materialize. <br><br>And as you’ve stated in your last paragraph, you need to be direct. So get direct! <br><br>Good questions!  But stay focused! <br><br>Still your pal, <br>Sal<br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal the question is one that I ask those pitching deals to me in hopes of getting us to fund or buy their deals. I use this question to weed out those who come across as being direct who are not. By asking what will the decision maker tell me about you, often gets those deal pitchers to come clean and say well they don&#39;t really know me but they know so and so who I am working with or the usual BS line of I&#39;m the sellers mandate and everything goes through me which 99.9% of the time it doesn&#39;t.<br><br>I once commented to you in an email that I don&#39;t get involved with daisy chains and the best way to not become a welcomed member of a unwanted deal party is to weed out the idiots ahead of time.        </p>

          Sal:<br>I&#39;m not trying to be the teacher here, I just wanted to comment on my experience in the capital deployment business. This is for new intermediaries.<br><br>1. Know your five data point questions, you cannot get from Point A to B without this information.<br><br>2. Don&#39;t ever get emotionally attached to a deal, it is a money making vehicle only.<br><br>3. Know the story of the deal because if Dandrew wants to proceed and your not in a position to answer questions or you need to stall the deal because you have to go back and ask questions, you will come across as not being direct and if your not direct, you will never close the deal.<br><br>4. Treat Dandrew Capital Partners money as your own. Respect it&#39;s true value by asking the hard questions with the hardest one being If I were writing the check to fund this deal and not Sal, would I do it.<br><br>5. Don&#39;t advertise or market yourself on these supposed internet deal boards like Crepig, Broker Outpost, etc because you will open the flood gates to deals that come along with a daisy chain or are not realistic.<br><br>Channel your marketing efforts to deal makers such as attorneys, CPA&#39;s, commercial real estate brokers who actually have real deals where you will be direct. Being Direct=Real Deals=Real and consistent fees.        </p>

          I am too old to be anything but straight  forward so at the risk of being a complainer here goes. I bought this program after a lot of questioning and discussion with my partner before the final commitment . I thought it was ready to go and paid my $595 with that expectation. Now frankly it looks a little like &quot;affordable health care&quot;  when I click on a window and it&#39;s not ready. I am now glad I didn&#39;t  go for the $1495. Somehow this wasn&#39;t part of the presentation. I have access to a number of off market high cap deals that I wanted to run by you. When I get information from my connections they have expectations of my performance. Some supply all the info necessary to initiate going forward and that&#39;s where your program gave me hope compared to a lot of crap that&#39;s out there. Honestly I am stuck in &quot;wait&quot; again. No POF. No LOI and no buyers or way to buy these properties myself or partner. Granted I haven&#39;t looked at every book and tape as yet, but I also haven&#39;t discovered a step by step procedure to follow . And I keep running into stops, not ready yet? Well, you were ready for me to pay? One of the reasons I decided to commit to this deal was Danill and the great service I have received from him and Jacob so I accepted the recommendation. I am not looking for an excuse to quit, but I need to clear the air. Another reason I bought in is that the presentation coincided with what I know is happening in the financial arena and hopefully a way to outmaneuver it. Looking forward to a reply.  Howard        </p>

          Howard, <br><br>And I’m too cranky and busy to be anything but blunt here. So because you asked, I’ll answer as it will make the case for others who attempt to do the same.  <br><br>First, you registered *yesterday*. You’ve not gone through anything yet. <br>You’ve not even read your AskDandrew Owner’s Manual and Quick Start Guide yet.<br><br>How do I know this? I see you never opened that link on your email. AJ knows everything. <br><br>In fact if you did, then you know where it would be appropriate for you to voice your concerns. <br><br>This is *not* the appropriate place for these questions. Just deal specific questions. *So now you have probably miffed some others who actually log on here to see my thoughts and ideas on their meaningful and thoughtful questions here.*<br><br>And, now I am going to get emails from our Alumni complaining to me about you complaining on a membership site that they are paying $97 to read. So, in advance, I thank you for that and attempting to erode the morale of this group and not doing what you were supposed to do. <br><br>Now I have to take time out of my day instead of putting together term sheets and bid for our students, replying to emails from customers asking my why you don’t follow directions and that their $97/$597/$1497 is a lot of money to them and to please be more thoughtful of the comments others put on this site. <br><br>Second, we said you would get a POF. Never did we say we would provide an LOI. We never said that, I never said that. You made that up. <br><br>Just because you paid $597 doesn’t mean that you’re going to be successful. Actually, those who don’t follow our instructions rarely are. That is what I meant on the webinar when I said “only grown up men and women”.<br><br>Actually, from my experience, and in my opinion *you’re not going to be successful* as you don’t want to take the time to listen to your money *(us)* and would rather let your sellers lead you around by the nose. That has worked for nobody. <br><br>This is not for whiners and complainers, just like Daniil’s program. This is for folks who will do what is expected of them. Too much time and effort has been placed into putting these systems into place for others grownup men and women to benefit from to be ignored.  That is why they are successful. <br><br>If you are expecting to just send deals over because you think the $597 entitled you to hit the forward button to our desk, you have delusions of grandeur and should probably send your deals elsewhere to another guru who will not have your best interests at heart. <br><br>However, you are free to review the modules and follow instructions to try to become successful, but given the tone of your email, I’m not going to bet the farm on this. <br><br>So if I were you, I’d start reviewing all of the content *before* you contact anyone about finding deals. You can be redeemed and I’m waiting to see if “old” (as you referred to yourself as) dogs can learn new tricks.  <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Howard, I am not sure which program you bought into, however let me assure you Sal is the real deal. There is not another program in existence where you get access to money for your deals. If there were, you would have never came here to begin with.<br><br>There is a deal submission site that is outlined almost immediately, where you can submit your deals. Once you submit the deal you need to stay on it because if you don&#39;t you will not get a second chance.<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>If banks can be participants in a JV deal or two mortgage companies coming together in a JV in a deal such as a development opportunity, is it structured 50/50 or would the percentage of ownership so to speak be in proportion to how much capital each placed?<br><br>Can one bank provide the equity and the other provide the debt and for the one that provides the debt, how does their ownership in the JV work?        </p>

          Banks don&#39;t usually provide equity, so I don&#39;t really understand your question. They provide the *debt* and private investors like us will fill in the equity portion. <br><br>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve gone through your JV vs Fund Structures yet so this will be made clear during your viewing of the Private Equiteer videos. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I have experienced sponsors/buyers of commercial Real Estate. They ask me these questions so they now how to structure their deals.  Do you have Dandrews answer to what our expectation is comparative to other funding sources such as Blackstone?<br>Blackstone<br><br>•Net Return Goal: 16%+<br>•Management Fees: 1.5%<br>•Preferred Return for LP&#39;s: 8%<br>•Subsequent LP/GP Splits - 80/20 to 20%, then 20/80<br>        </p>

          These terms are what my sponsors were asking me, not investors.  They have the 70% debt covered and their 10% skin in the game and want 20% equity partner and want to know what are return goal and split expectation so when they make an offer they have what we want covered so that they are more likely to get our financing.   I don&#39;t know what Blackstone is doing nor do I care but I have heard many in my network talk about them.  I want to know the diffence between our funding ( Institutional ) and theirs  (retail)        </p>

          They didn&#39;t &quot;drop:&quot; the name Blackstone.  I heard them mentioned only once at a networking conference. I got this from inside a web page link another student provided and You said that it was &quot;great&quot;...I&#39;m assuming you meant it was to know what our competition is doing?

          Molly, one of the first lessons I learned in this business is that you need to guide the structuring the deal. You need to earn your keep so to speak. Just because someone is an experienced sponsor operator does not make them experienced when it comes to structuring transactions. It is for this reason that capital advisory firms are hired as well as private equity guys can also be retained.<br><br>You need to ask what they are looking for in funding of their deal, for example are they looking for a 75/15 deal and they come to the table with the balance of 10% as cash equity. Are they looking for a joint venture partner and not a loan. One question I always ask is what is the ideal capital stack in your deal.<br><br>If you don&#39;t get a clear picture of what it is the client is looking for, you will go around in circles, pitching ideas to your client and never getting the deal done.<br><br>Lead the deal, come to the deal as the problem solver because if the client has to lead you, they will just try to go it themselves. This is just my four and a half cents.        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>Any suggestions on where/how to look for defaulted mezz pieces?  Have FDIC for lenders and various sources for the owners of commercial properties but not sure how to search for mezz lenders other than LinkedIn.        </p>

          Good graphic distributed today on Structuring Sound Governance of Funds! It generated a few questions I can&#39;t answer yet: <br>- what is a &quot;key man&quot; event as referenced in the &lt;Key Persons&gt; block? <br>- in the &lt;Investment Committee&gt; block there is a reference to a &quot;non-executive officer.&quot; What is meant by a non-executive officer?         </p>

          1. *&quot;Key Man&quot;*<br>Here&#39;s an example of *&quot;key man&quot;*. I&#39;m the &quot;key man&quot; in Dandrew Media. If I get hit by a bus, the business may cease to exist in its highest and best operations. <br><br>That means no more infographics that people love, no more continuing eds, no more writing scripts, or having to repeat myself on why the POFs aren&#39;t being issued now &lt;sigh&gt;. <br><br>So any investors in Dandrew Media, if there were any, would want me to get &quot;key man&quot; insurance to cover for the potential loss in revenue to the business and protect their investment in my business. <br><br>The business would probably go on as AJ would take over. But I&#39;m the guy who makes the rain and the insurance would cover the bridge until people warmed up to AJ. <br><br>2. *Non-Executive Officer, Non-Executive Director (&quot;NED or NXD&quot;)*<br>These are independent directors who are not internal directors, sit on boards of different companies. they can still hold shares in a company that they advise on and for start ups, equity is given instead of cash compensation. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Only one question on the Infographic from just David? I&#39;m sad now.         </p>

          Sal,<br>I had an idea for a JV arrangement tied into a consulting opportunity. I came up with this idea just a bit ago. I have currently 400 plus connections on LinkedIn and many are securities attorneys, attorneys that specialize in funds and the legal side, compliance, etc.<br><br>Since there can be significant legal costs associated with doing capital raises, I got to thinking. Why not JV with one of these attorneys, who will do the legal. I handle the capital raise and put all these services into a package, with one price tag and profits are spilt 50/50 after costs are recouped.<br><br>In your opinion is this a viable undertaking?        </p>

          I think that is a solid idea. Never tried that personally, but I think that is a strong thesis. <br><br>I don&#39;t think lawyers are able to bundle their services for a fee, but what I would do is to call them and tell them how you can do your real estate capital raising services. <br><br>Great idea. <br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have been watching the videos in the Fundraising Fundamentals Program. There is nowhere to leave comments, so I am doing it here.<br><br>I think that anyone who watches the videos cannot be anything less than excited. I think what is being taught opens the doors to so many opportunities to generate income.<br><br>This is not for the faint of heart and certainly not for anyone who does not really want to have their own Wall Street Firm, even if that firm is located outside Wall Street and not even in NYC, NY. As you and I both know, being Native New Yorkers as we are is that most investments banks are not located on Wall Street but up around 5th Avenue anyway. The firms on Wall Street are those trading houses that work the floor on the exchange.<br><br>I think that one thing people have to understand and realize is that money goes where it is respected most. What I mean by this is that those with discretionary capital will place monies with those that they trust to look out for their best interests and when you can help someone get their money working for them and generating returns, you are really looking out for their best interests.<br><br>My wife asked me what the difference between being in the banker program and the Private Equity Program with Dandrew is and I told her that I get to play in the same league as the biggest firms in our business and I explained to her that those who create funds, orchestrate the successful capital raise gets to experience perks such as riding in the back of cars and sitting at the front of planes but more important is that a successful deal creates additional opportunities and that our world and that of our family has just changed.<br><br>By the way Sal, it is 0215 am and I am up working. I do not sleep. I can sleep when I have a hundred million dollars in the bank. <br><br>My thoughts are in closing that people really have to know your here. They have to know what your doing and how what your doing can align with what they are doing or want to do. I am big on using LinkedIn. People want to do business with those who have a presence and can do things like we can do. Everyone who is important wants to be aligned with those who they view are just as important as they are or more important.<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>There are a lot of real estate expos popping up all over the country. Do you feel these are worth attending, and while visiting the exhibitor area, approach private and hard money lenders who are doing residential, discuss what we do, simply telling them that I raise and deploy capital for distressed and opportunistic commercial real estate opportunities,<br>and I am looking to put together a deal sourcing team.<br><br>What this accomplishes is making available opportunities to those in the residential sector to add a profit center for them and gets my reach out further in the marketplace.<br><br>Cost to attend very little, end result? Immeasurable. Your thoughts?        </p>

          Absolutely. <br><br>I&#39;ve even gone to conferences where I just blatantly loiter in the hotel bar picking up contacts. But make sure these contacts are really going to add value. You don&#39;t need time vampires or drinking buddies. <br><br>Just go in not making promises to people and you&#39;ll be OK.          </p>

          I live in Arlington, Texas and there are deals everywhere. I have found that if you call a commercial real estate brokerage and ask to speak to the agent or broker associate who handles distressed commercial deals, you will be put directly in touch. The next step is to then explain the Dandrew program as if it your program.<br><br>When you touch on the point that banks are not lending, the program is for serious and experienced  sponsor operators and funding is generally within 30 days, and you only deal direct with the decision makers, you will have established credibility and if the borrower is an experienced sponsor operator and you close a deal for them, you will have built credibility as a doer and not a wanna be and that will open doors for you.        </p>

          There are a ton of people on LinkedIn waving &quot;I&#39;ve got money!&quot; flags around. I doubt many of them get hits. What&#39;s a better way to use LinkedIn to bring in the business?         </p>

          Sal and Dave,<br>What I have been doing is this. I have used the FDIC strategy and located banks who are having problems. Once I have the banks name and the name of those at that bank who are either in whole loans, asset disposal, Upper management, etc, I then take that information and go to Linked in.<br><br>I then do a search for the individuals and send out an invitation to connect. I actually setup a second Linkedin page dedicated to just this endeavor.<br><br>Now if the person does not have a profile and yes as hard it is to fathom in today&#39;s social media crazed world , I then will go back to the search box and input the banks name and city and state and from there I can usually find what I am looking for.<br><br>I find that the key to getting these individuals to respond is to have a summary section that focuses part on you and part on what you do.<br><br>These folks are looking for a reason to connect and to know that who they are dealing with is someone who has an alignment of interests.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I recently begun discussions with the CFO of a bank in Longview, Texas who is also the banks Chief Credit Officer. They are not overly depressed on their balance sheets but could be hit real hard, real soon.<br><br>Here is the situation. Their portfolios consist of a large level of residential assets that are performing, re-performing and as they put it, running up on scratch and dent levels. Most loans are secured by assets in Longview, Tyler, Marshall and some other cities. They do to like to lend outside of a 50 mile radius. They said they have a plan in place for their NP loans where they will do workouts on them.<br><br>They also have their commercial portfolio which they would love to do a asset disposal of a good portion of the total pool. The properties are primarily secured by office and warehouses where the payors are those entities that are Barnett Shale oil field companies. This is where they are about to get hit hard.<br><br>They are fearful that these companies will reduce operations here in Texas and good loans will go bad. They said that while they can stomach residential NP loans, to have their commercial loans fall to this status will be too much to stomach.<br><br>My question now is this. When Dandrew buys these pools, is the fact that the assets are not in tier-1 cities have an impact on the bid? when you grade the deal, is it graded on a loan by loan basis or as a whole, then points deducted of to speak for loans that are not in a tier-1 area or does the tier-1 situation even come into play to the point where the entire deal is graded on the basis your getting in at?        </p>

          James<br><br>You have just uncovered why we tell all intermediaries to focus on the smaller banks. Good for you. <br><br>For NPN, P, RPN assets: to answer your question, geography only plays into the bid *as it relates to costs and time related to foreclose*. <br><br>So with Texas, its not so much of an issue as Texas is pro-business, pro-landlord and if they don’t pay you can lasso their rears out in 21 days. <br><br>In NY or NJ, that would create a more compressed bid as getting to our collateral would take longer. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          You mention we should do our first couple syndications as &quot;dealers&quot; rather than as owner-operators/sponsors.  Would you suggest a) finding deals through commercial real estate brokers and then looking for a sponsor/operator who would be interested in the deal, or b) looking for operators, (from a funder&#39;s perspective), who already have a great deal and need to fund it?  (Or maybe a c) I don&#39;t know about) <br><br>If b), will I run into these opportunities during my regular course of business while looking for deals for Dandrew to fund, or is there a better way to go out and find these?        </p>

          Joanne: <br><br>This is a *very* good question. <br><br>I would suggest the following sequence: <br><br>1.  *Speak to Investors First*<br>I have put a lot of time into the 2 decks that are included in the www.PrivateBankerIdentityKit.com. <br>Why? You want to have some investors teed up to move when you see an opportunity. <br><br>One of the 2 decks is an introduction to syndications. I have, as well as other Intermediaries, have found a lot of investors using this basic, manual which explains the process. It gives people an awareness and tells them where their money will be and how it will be used. <br><br>The other is the “deal deck”. Now that you have a deal, this is what you use to go back and pitch to your investors your deal. <br><br>2.  Follow the *”How to Syndicate Deals In A Tough Economy Infographic”*.  This is important. This will tell you what to syndicate and what not to syndicate. <br><br>3.  Follow the *Syndication Timeline Infographic*. It is yellow in color. You can’t miss it. <br><br>4.  *Yes*. You will run across these opportunities when running across your general business in real estate looking for opportunities for us to fund. <br><br>Follow the *”Inside Baseball: Total Real Estate Capital Strategy Infographic”* to help with your decision-making here. <br><br>If you get an opportunity and want to discuss. Place it here. I’ll help you. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Try this. Tell the bank the following...I would like to sign your CA and advise that since I am a buyers rep for the fund I buy for and I only have one buyer who will see this. Can I bring the fund into the deal? if they have no interest, I will agree not to show the tape and information to anyone else. I can complete the investor profile however it may not accurately reflect my buyers total criteria.        </p>
