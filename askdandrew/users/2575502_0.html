          Hello Sal and Cory,<br>Regarding the DIP course, several aspects are unclear to me, and those questions are, within DIP;<br>1. Is the Dandrew member, or Dandrew itself, the stalking horse?  The same question for the white knight (or is the white knight a 3rd party borrower/buyer)?  <br>2. Does Dandrew eventually speak with the Bk atty, or does the Dandrew member serve as the sole intermediary throughout?   Wouldn’t the former make the Dandrew member look like an amateur?<br>3. If Dandrew finalizes the financing directly with the atty, what keeps the atty from just cutting the member out in the future?   <br>4.  Does the Dandrew member responsible for DIP due diligence expenses?<br>5. Are there any DIP documents that you specifically wish to be utilized?  There are none in the course pertaining to financing agreements  (I realize there is a marketing piece).<br>6.  Concerning the POF, the POF agreement contained in a Distressed Commercial workbook states that we are not to claim to be part of Dandrew, or joint venture partners of Dandrew, but in the videos, we are instructed to act as such.  Not wanting to violate any signed agreements, would you please elaborate here?  Would the POF be in our company name to show prospective attys interested in DIP?<br>It would be great if the DIP course had its own Q and A section within that site.  Thank you.<br>        </p>

          Rick: these are great questions. I&#39;ll answer them in the order you asked them. <br><br>1. *Is the Dandrew member, or Dandrew itself, the stalking horse? The same question for the white knight (or is the white knight a 3rd party borrower/buyer)? *<br>Answer: No. We are not buyers, we&#39;re simply the funding source to the transaction. <br><br>2. *Does Dandrew eventually speak with the Bk atty, or does the Dandrew member serve as the sole intermediary throughout? Wouldn’t the former make the Dandrew member look like an amateur? *<br>Answer: Not sure what you mean by amateur. Our credit committee (read Fred and I) would get involved and definately speak to the BK trustee. <br><br>3. *If Dandrew finalizes the financing directly with the atty, what keeps the atty from just cutting the member out in the future?*<br>Good question. On the term sheet we send out, we place your fee on it as one of the terms and your corresponding compensation. Atty&#39;s won&#39;t cut intermediaries out and neither will we. But by nature of the fact that these BKs are already very legally indepth, an atty would risk a lot if he didn&#39;t tell us that he was working with you. Like his license. <br><br>4. *Does the Dandrew member responsible for DIP due diligence expenses? *<br>Answer: Absolutely not. that is all managed and calculated by the trustee who sets aside fees for Dandrew to do their own due diligence. <br><br>5. *Are there any DIP documents that you specifically wish to be utilized? There are none in the course pertaining to financing agreements (I realize there is a marketing piece). *<br>Answer: No. and this is by design. this is like you buying someone you know a nice suit without knowing their measurements. Each &quot;doc&quot; is specific to the case and transaction.<br> <br>6. *Concerning the POF, the POF agreement contained in a Distressed Commercial workbook states that we are not to claim to be part of Dandrew, or joint venture partners of Dandrew, but in the videos, we are instructed to act as such. Not wanting to violate any signed agreements, would you please elaborate here? Would the POF be in our company name to show prospective attys interested in DIP*? <br>Answer: You are an independent contractor who has a POF that states you have the ability to fund specific transactions at our final discretion. I would suggest that you tell prospective atty&#39;s that your funding source (as evidenced by the POF) would be interested in looking at this funding scenario directly as it is more complicated than what you&#39;re able to fund individually. <br>The DIP should have one however, until we get this sites service provider to alert me of these notications, I&#39;d prefer that all of these answers being aggregated here. <br><br>Sal        </p>
