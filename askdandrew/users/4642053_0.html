          So to give you an idea of our projects, here is one that I am currently working on in Monterrey.  There are only two owners, who have created separate non-profits who essentially have this project unencumbered.   <br><br>This project is an eco-green minded smart build, not necessarily leed but as close as they can get to trim expenses (ie no solo panel fields on the roof just more efficient clean energy implementations).  These particular sellers come from a back ground of Build&amp; Green certified, they engineered and implemented the project, there are three wells in stone water that are in place to offset the cities water issues with drip systems for irrigation and low water plants offsite ready to be brought in.   The underground has been done and t, well positioned. Permit ready to break ground for about $100k. <br><br>Location wise, this property is situated close to the airport and to the golf course. There is a high demand for 5000 sqft office buildings on triple-nets light industrial in this area.  Target anchors would be Architects, Botany, Agent Broker offices ie (potentially a new Prudential/ Bershire Hathaway).   The condominium project is expected to yield a 20%-30% higher rental capture as it could be marketed as executive condo&#39;s.   <br><br>Now the exit strategy will be to lease this out to a strong anchor, and sell the condo&#39;s on the total investment.  Or add this to a more savvy investor portfolio as a direct build project. The benefits to the builder will be name branding and recognition in the building community, and a potential JV opportunity on the projected project.<br><br>An example of who we would choose to pair this project with would be Developers with the vision is to create another viable alternative to traditional building. Ones who provide eco friendly, sustainable building options that are achievable and affordable.   Such as the builders I have attached.<br><br>So if you look at the Proforma you will see what we anticipate the build costs to be and what the end profits should come close to.   This does not include our consultation fees, or your fees.  We typically work 10% as a brokerage fee to match these smart building projects up front on a project takeover. <br><br>So what I would like to know is do you have a direct investor who wants to expand their portfolio directly and take the build for us to market the bank end sale, or what your thoughts are on could I run the funding of the project through my Roth as a peer investor overseeing the project til fruition. <br><br>I have thoughts about creating a JV with the builder with Owner carry back on whatever was not funded out as a risk cover.   I am in the business of reducing risks and building wealth, fully funded with draw breakouts would hit around 75% on future value of a green build which includes about half our fee off these projections (not included but on a back end portfolio project for an investor portfolio we would settle at this)   <br><br>There is a lot of skin on this one.  Let me know your thoughts on how you would structure this to your investors.<br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Faith. <br><br>I see your new. Welcome! From a Fund Managers perspective, I&#39;m looking at this different than that of an operator.<br><br>So, let me tell you what this would look like if I brought this to our Investment Committee. I, too, am in the business and have a great track record of reducing risks and throwing good, steady-Eddie returns to our LPs. So, let me put my cynical hat on and continue: <br><br>I don&#39;t understand this deal. What I hear is how *you* want to make money, and how *you* want to structure the deal, how much *you* want to make in consulting fees, a 10% brokerage fee to *you*, running it through *your* Roth (you must mean self directed IRA) but I have no idea about the basis (what you are getting in at), who the Sponsor is going to be, do they have &quot;green&quot; experience (many say they do and don&#39;t) and *how I make money*. What is a peer investor? Who are they? What is their experience? What are they bringing to the table. is that what you mean by &quot;skin&quot;? Skin means someone is contributing cash or assets to a deal. <br><br>California development? The California Coastal Commission is scary. Has your Sponsor dealt with them before? <br><br>Long story short, I don&#39;t think this deal is for us. But I want you to see how this deal is thought of through the eyes of an investor, meaning capital partner. <br><br>The development deals we&#39;re doing now are not ground up eco deals in what many in this industry call a &quot;vanity industry&quot;, but rather a broken development that needs capital to finish it up. <br><br>One example we&#39;re working on is a Walgreens that the developer couldn&#39;t finish and has a 40 year lease ready to go when he has it finished. <br><br>That is what we&#39;re doing. <br><br>Keep up the great work! Sorry if I was a little harsh, but this is how any PE firm like ours would analyze this. <br><br>Sal        </p>
