          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;m listening to one of the Arbitrage live video tapes, you mentioned an intermediary was paid a consultant fee from a builder in showing how to sell using seller financing and a percentage of the profit. The builder more than likely made a loan from a commercial bank and he may or may not have an turbo clause in his docs. My question to you is getting a consultant fee from the builder using seller financing. Please elaborate.<br>Thanks,<br>Dexter          </p>

          PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>Located approximately 30 minutes north of Atlanta, GA in the Johns Creek Industrial Park.  The project was built in 2008 by Kaiser Development Corp. Current Owner purchased this asset for $7,800,000. The note was then sold to another lender and once it matured in 2011, the lender has foreclosed on the property (said illegally), but it agreed to sell it back to the owner for $5,400,000.<br><br>Purchase = $5,400,000 <br>As- Is value = $7,700,000 (appraisal available)<br>Loan = $5,400,000<br>LTV = 70%<br>Cross-Collateral Performing Assets in NY and FL with 100% occupancy, owned free and clear = $4 Mil; All assets are<br>       performing. DO not want to sell anything to buy this asset, but use as a cross- collateral id needed.<br>NOI= $468,000<br>Proforma NOI = No idea for now<br>Occupancy= 47% (low occupancy since this is a REO, plan in place to increase to 100%)<br>SqFt= 145,783<br><br>Current Tenants:<br>Siemens Electronics: Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement; Gross Income = $389,389 <br>Get Air Suwanee Parks: Lease Expires in 2020; Annual Gross Income =$308,016<br><br>Story: Building built in 2008. Sponsor is 100% experienced, and manages other three commercial assets owned free and clear. Low occupancy is due to the fact that this is a REO. Sponsor has plan in place to increase occupancy to 100%. He is considering using one of his free and clear owned assets to take an additional “value added” loan to increase the occupancy at 100%. The two loans can be combined.<br><br>Exit Strategy= Refinancing, cash out by selling the cross-collateral assets if necessary. <br><br>Since we are at the beginning of learning about your deal acceptance requirements, I am submitting some deals in this forum.

          Fulga<br><br>Where are the 5 data points? It seems as though you broke a few rules here and did it the “Fulga Way”. <br><br>I’m going to break this down because I don’t want you to make these mistakes with other people outside of Dandrew as it will ruin your credibility *instantly* with other funds. <br><br>You just came from a conference with sophisticated investors in NYC, didn’t you?

(I&#39;ll explain why they didn&#39;t give you the Proforma in a moment below and why you walked right into a trap...!)<br><br>Also, because you’re working with me privately in a virtual coaching environment you know appraisals aren’t worth the paper they are written on. Correct? <br><br>Also, your sponsor is asking for 100% of the Purchase Price. They just merely increased or had the appraisal clock in at a level that would make it look like it would be financed at 70%. *This is why we ask for the 5 Data Points as we can see through the deal clearly*. <br><br>As you know, REOs don’t have any loans, so when you mention 2 loans can be combined confuses me. <br><br>Regarding the tenant: “Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement.” This is the equivalent of asking a woman if she is pregnant or not: Has it been renewed or not?

          Fulga, there are some very creative things that can be done here. The best strategy is to place the three free and clear properties into a LLC and refinance the properties with the new LLC assuming the debt, using income from all three to pay the debt.<br><br>Use the refinance proceeds to pay off the one property and sell it to the new LLC. The new LLC now has increased value and then sell off each space in the foreclosed property to the tenants. Owning is always more attractive than leasing.<br><br>Use the sale proceeds to retire all the debt and the LLC has increased it&#39;s value a lot.        </p>

          Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>As stated in my Comment Post, I did not post this deal with the purpose to be approved, but rather to better understand your position on situations where there is an asset that is purchased at 30% below market value, request for financing is 100% and there is cross-collateral owned free and clear that could be easily sold to recover the capital. There are great discussion points that we could all benefit from, so let’s start by answering your questions the best I can:<br><br>1.  Your sponsor is asking for 100% of the Purchase Price. They just merely increased or had the appraisal clock in at a level that would make it look like it would be financed at 70%. This is why we ask for the 5 Data Points as we can see through the deal clearly.<br>Answer: If I understand your response correctly, we should be skeptical of deals where the sponsor does not have “skin in the game”, even if there is an appraisal report showing more than 25% equity, and there is solid cross-collateral. So far 50% our sponsors request capital for assets purchased at a discount with equity higher than 25%, and present to us appraisal reports to confirm the equity. I know the answer to this is:  “it depends” on the deal…market tier, class asset, sponsor experience, etc… My take on this is that the Exit Strategy is a good decision factor on deals like this. If one can easily recover the capital with minimum risk, than the deal merits further consideration in my opinion. When I see “Refinancing” as an Exit Strategy, I am skeptical because we all know how expensive and painful the foreclosure process is. As an investor, I like deals where I can get the Deed of a cross- collateral asset that I could sell fast and recover my capital in case the sponsor defaults…but this is just me! This sponsor has 3 assets owned free and clear in NY and FL as a cross-collateral, and that’s the main reason I presented this deal for discussion.  <br><br>I know we should be skeptical about an appraisal value provided by sponsor, however, the validity of the value is always confirmed as part of the “due diligence” as the expense of the sponsor.  <br><br>To conclude this, please elaborate further so we could all learn: How should we approach deals where a sponsor requests 100% financing when they are buying back their property/note from the bank at a 25% and up discount? They provide an Appraisal report from a credible company proving the fair market value. Shall we say “No”, upfront even if there is cross-collateral? Shall we consider other factors as tier market, class asset, etc. in addition to cross-collateral? <br><br>2.  Regarding “Where are the 5 data points? It seems as though you broke a few rules here and did it the “Fulga Way”, <br>Answer: Sorry if you feel that I broke the rules, because the 5 data points were presented in the narrative as follows: <br><br>1.  Current NOI: $468,000<br>2.  Proforma NOI: No Idea (it was really stupid for me to say that: I should have stated in a different way; good point to beat on me! On my defense, this was a deal for discussion, not for approval. Anyway, the Infographic states that Pro forma is a “TYPICALLY a COMPLETE LIE”, but I really understand its merit. <br>3.  Debt stack: $7,800,000 (so there is no overleverage) <br>4.  Sources and Uses: Purchase<br>5.  Exit Strategy: Refinancing and contingency as Cross-collateralization <br><br>3.  As you know, REOs don’t have any loans, so when you mention 2 loans can be combined confuses me.<br>Answer: As stated in my Comment, the sponsor would like to get an additional loan, if possible. Since there are 3 assets as cross- collateral, we could “refinance” one of them, and the sponsor would use the money to add value to the subject property. This was very appealing to me that made the deal stronger.<br><br>4.  Regarding the tenant: “Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement.” This is the equivalent of asking a woman if she is pregnant or not: Has it been renewed or not? That is a very critical part of this. Only 2 answers will suffice. If they didn’t renew, that will break the deal.<br>Answer: Lessons learned: We should have just stated: Lease Expires in 2015, without including that there is an agreement for renewal…or present fact for the Lease Renewal. Good point!<br><br>We are at the beginning of this journey with you, and as you stated so often in your videos, one needs to date before marrying ...so we are in the dating period to better understand the deals that should NOT be submitted. We receive many deals where the 5 points look pretty good, but instead of submitting the deal immediately, we are digging further, and we see issues that surface.  Honestly, I understand why many deals submitted with the 5 data points get rejected. I think that additional points should be added to pre-qualify a deal…that would make the process more efficient….but again…I just started this business and have a lot to learn. <br><br>Thank you for your help.        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I understand what you are talking about here. Let’s remember a few things, and I have to continue to remind myself that I’m dealing with a highly-educated engineer here, so we can communicate correctly. You like the facts, or what someone tells you are “facts”. More on that in a moment.<br> <br>1. We created the 5 Data Points as a *pre-qualification only* to see if we should have a “second date”. More info from this is adding too many ingredients to the soup and can spoil (or fool) the Intermediary easily who is newer. <br><br>2. My answers are to train you and everyone to *think critically about deals*.<br><br>My old boss at GS once told me “always assume the guy on the other side of the trade is looking to [fool] you”. <br>The fact that they want 100% of purchase price is OK, *but it’s the basis we don’t know*. Appraisals are not taken seriously by anyone. <br><br>So what do we do? We look at the a) *UPB* (Unpaid Principal Balance) and, b) *price-per-pound*, or what similar assets have traded at. (The subscription website you showed me would give you this very important info, by the way!). That will tell us if we’re really getting in at a good basis or not. <br><br>Don’t get me wrong, we’ve funded 100% of DPOs before and we’re fine with that so long as, among other things, we’re in at a *good basis*. <br><br>Put another way, if I had a 1 oz Gold Coin, we know that these are currently going for ~$1,400 an ounce that I could buy, I’m almost certain you would fund me at a purchase price (“basis”) at $400, $500, maybe even $900 using that gold as collateral. <br><br>But if I were to tell you I was buying this for $1200, you may not be so excited with the basis I’m getting this deal at and want me to put some fresh equity in. <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Fulga, I enjoyed our conversation today. However, let me say this. Even know my firm is not in the business of acquiring properties, I have bought some in the past. Sometimes, if a property is sold at 30 cents on the dollar it&#39;s because that&#39;s all it really is worth in today&#39;s quick sale dollars.<br><br>This is a strategy hard money lenders will use to determine what a property is worth to them Some hard money lenders understand an appraisal isn&#39;t worth the paper it&#39;s written on, so they will use quick sale value.<br><br>To those reading this and wonder what that term means, it means the following. If a property has a future value or after repair value of $100,000.00 and it&#39;s purchased for $45,000.00 or 45% of future value! then what can a hard money lender sell it for right now if they had to foreclose. <br><br>If you said $45,000.00 your incorrect because this is what was paid for it, not what it&#39;s actually worth. If you bought correctly because you knew what you were doing, you&#39;d have a property worth more than you paid, if your lacking knowledge, you&#39;d pay too much.<br><br>I have an idea how to structure this so it could be funded. Give a few minutes to digest this.        </p>

          Re:Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse <br><br>Sal, I don’t get you, sorry! <br>Why the UPB should be part of qualifying this deal? Aren’t the Fair Market Value (FMV), LTV and Exit Strategy what matter, so one could assess the risks and mitigate them if needed to recover the capital? Everything in life and business is risk management and mitigation, so one could avoid doing damage control; that’s why I consider Refinancing as an Exit strategy pretty risky because foreclosure as a mitigation is very painful and costly…but I love cross-collateral where I can get the shares of the company (or the deed) and I can easily recover my money.  <br><br> What would I care if the sponsor bought the property at a peak or valley market and the UBP is higher or lower TODAY? All I should care is how much I can sell the asset and / or the cross-collateral TODAY.<br>Regarding everything else you said…so true. But please believe me…I am hard to get by being fooled by people (I die hard, if you saw the movie).<br>So, is this deal a NO?        </p>

          Fulga, <br>You make excellent points. My answers have to do with my knowledge of the market. The market is pragmatic, and everything here is technical.<br><br>Let me explain: <br><br>Technically speaking, yes, a refinance into a conduit loan is an exit strategy. <br><br>Pragmatically speaking, however; if banks aren’t lending right now refinance is a bad option. Only an outright sale. <br><br>The main issue why this is a *pass* is because one of the main tenants leases expire in 2015. Then what? Who do they have lined up for this specialized space? Anyone different would incur large T&amp;I expenses. Then there are rent concessions. <br><br>This isn&#39;t as easy as getting a conduit or larger syndicated loan for a retail, or multi-family asset. Those happen every day. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Tobias: <br><br>This sounds like a recipe for disaster. I see you’ve been with us for about 3 months now. Which is great. But the scenario you laid out here is that your “partner” has experience. <br><br>Then your “partner” knows a guy who has experience. <br><br>Now, I’m a mentor to you guys, but I can tell you that if you’re going to do a deal like this, you need to have the best and most experienced operator you can. <br><br>For these obvious reason, we’re a pass. <br><br>*Simply knowing a guy who knows a guy isn’t a recipe for success.* If this deal is a real deal, and right now we don’t know and - no one wants to know until you have an experience operator who is your partner in this deal as referenced by an Operating Agreement and laid out business plan for how you’re going to manage the asset – you essentially don’t have an opportunity. Just a deal that a seller agreed to a price, and relatively speaking that could be a bid too high for all your investors know. <br><br>Keep going through the materials. This will become apparently clear to you the longer you’re with us. <br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          Okay, I understand your point.  I honestly still want try my best in getting funding. Although we are both beginners we both have the drive and character to be successful.  At 24, I would love nothing more than to concentrate on this full time and get out of the &quot;rat race.&quot;  I know what you mean in that the risks are high and could be a disastrous deal but at this stage in my life I would rather say oh well and learn the mistakes instead of saying what if.  Are there any other resources you can share with me to reach out to and get funding?<br><br>Thank you Sal,<br><br>Tobias        </p>

          Sal, here are the nuts and bolts of the property.  It is currently occupied by one tenant possibly two but that is in doubt as the bank has not been in the property in over a year.    Tenant/owner declared bankruptcy so as far as I know there are no guarantors that are enforceable on this property. The tenant/owner, a church had been paying  $10,000 per month for two thirds of the building. Building was owned prior by a credit union. Bank financed 2.8M note. When the bank gave notice of acceleration in January Tenant/owner tried to renegotiate the term of the loan out past 2015 and asked to reduce the debt.  The bank refused and is prepared to filed for foreclosure to take place on May 22 ( the foreclosure, not the notice).  The tenant stopped paying when the notice was given in January.  According to good commercial brokers in the area this is a relatively hot area and stabilized it should have a gross of 225-250K and a net of 160-175K.  The building is in very good shape from what I can tell and seven years ago 300-350K was put into the property to upgrade systems etc.  Its a three level brick building that has potential for signage for a user that would be seen by 50-100K cars a day.  Has surface parking of around 35-40 spaces and good linkage. Five minutes from DC line. I have pictures of the property I could email you and the summary page from a prior appraisal that is too old to be of value.  Basically its about 53/foot purchase, way below replacement cost.  The space is being marketed by a broker at $19/ft triple net.  Net rentable is about 15,000 square feet. Doesn&#39;t appear that roof or systems are not in good shape. The address of the collateral is 3900 48th Street Bladensburg, MD 20710.  Look forward to your thoughts.<br><br> Jim        </p>

          Who was the tenant? This sounds empty and with no sponsor or meaningful tenants. As a rule, we can&#39;t fund churches as that goes against our P&amp;Ps. <br><br>Also, seems small,with 160-175 Net NOI, this falls below our 2mm minimum threshold at a 10% (assuming a value of 1,600,000 to 1,750,000). <br><br>This is a pass. Please don&#39;t take it personally, just find something better. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Good Morning Sal,<br><br>I got a response from the Agent that listed the property and they represent the Bankruptcy Trustee. So does that mean that the person that owns the propery is not his client? If so I want to contact them and see if this is something that is workable. Any suggestions on what to say or include? FYI, the Cap Rate is almost 10% according to the info I seen online.<br><br>Thank you, Joseph.        </p>

          Joseph<br><br>I would strongly suggest that you get the DIP Financier. I see that you don&#39;t have this however, it also comes with a book of scripts that includes: <br><br>a) phone scripts<br>b) email scripts / auto-responders<br><br>The promotional price is still here as the website isn&#39;t up yet so I can still offer this to you. <br><br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathnifif<br><br>This should - and probably will - answer all your questions about communicating with these trustees and owners in distress. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to thank you for teaching us all, how to get into the industry and taking time away from an already full plate to help those here.<br><br>Since getting the PE program, I have just entered into an agreement, I mean just signed and faxed over all the agreements to do what I am going to tell you about.<br><br>I am working with my son who is a dentist and his partner as well as a local attorney to raise money from the medical community to acquire a medical clinic in Dallas that has been closed for years. Once acquired, it is going to be fully rehabbed and bought up to standards and it is going to be turned into a one day surgery center for medical procedures and dental procedures.<br><br>The attorney and my son and his business partner who is also a dentist have created a list of doctors who have made these types of investments in the past. We are going to host a luncheon in May, where a presentation of the project will be made and I will do the capital raise presentation.<br><br>I am creating the pitch book, the financial models of costs and other financial projections, P&amp;L profile, marketing plans, etc.<br><br>I valued the pitch book at $10,000.00, my time to set this up at $12,000.00 for three weeks of work and $2500.00 per day fee to do the luncheon presentation. In exchange, I will own 10% of the project, have an option to invest additional monies in facility number 2, they are planning to do 5 across the state of texas over 6 years. I will get 10% of the monthly profits each month there are profits.<br><br>If it were not for your teachings, I wouldn&#39;t be undertaking something like this.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am sitting here on a Sunday morning working, getting ready for tomorrows calls with several banks in the DFW area. I received a very interesting email that a broker forwarded to me by accident, I am certain because he lifted his skirt big time.<br><br>It was a email from a seller to him. I am posting the main part of it.<br><br>Dear  Steven,<br>This opportunity is going out to three brokers I have hand picked from prior experiences, your one of them. You have seventy two hours to submit your brokerages Letter of Interest and Proof of funds, to be used only in event you locate buyer, a contract for acquisition is consumated and the buyer does the eleventh hour bail out.<br><br>Please send via Fed EX, using Transaction Code 7712PNPNWestEastSouthwest. Thank you in advance.<br><br>This is a eye opener because it validates the point that brokers need buyers POF&#39;s to get into the party. I remember doing a real estate deal in Brooklyn, NY years ago that was where my partner was able to get into the deal by using my pof/bank statement. My partner locked up the deal with a thirty day option and $3,000.00 option consideration fee and his plan was to say to the seller that he was not able to go through with the purchase but has a partner who has indicated his willingness to do the deal and as good faith provided his pof.<br><br>For those here that are not investors right now but want to be, the above strategy is a very easy one to implement. You find a property and get it under contract.<br><br>You then begin marketing the property and once you have a solid buyer willing to do the deal, you have the buyer provide his/her POF along with an offer.<br><br>You go back to the seller and you say, I have a buyer who is going to partner with me. Since he/she will be the one arranging or providing funding, here is our POF.<br><br>You then simply assign your interest over to your partner after closing and walk away with your check.. Very real and very easy to do.        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed several times you&#39;ve mentioned to students to take a consulting fee for their advice to clients.  I understand a consulting fee for raising capital, or placing capital, but can you elaborate on charging a consulting fee for providing strategic advice?  What I mean, more so, is how and what to charge the client?  Due to intellectual capital and good &#39;ole common sense, it seems natural to me to provide strategic consulting, like that of an outside coach.  Just unsure how to protect myself and what to charge.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback!<br><br>Chris        </p>

          Chris. <br><br>I&#39;m going to be talking about this a little at the SDIRA workshop. Quite frankly, students/Intermediaries have been running with it themselves and I got the idea from what they were doing. <br><br>The point of the matter is that at some point, something bad is going to happen in the market and people will be rushing into real estate, as they are now. <br><br>The problem is that they don&#39;t know where their money is going and that is how bad things happen.<br><br> Questions such as: <br><br>*&quot;Where in the capital structure is your money going?&quot; <br>(&quot;Do you know what capital structure is?&quot;)*<br><br>*&quot;What is the experience of your sponsor?&quot;*  <br><br>*&quot;How are you pricing this Bulk NPN, REO, etc. portfolio you&#39;re buying?&quot;*<br><br>These are the soft-sale questions that many an Intermediary have asked an investor asking them to do due diligence for a deal. And its the hook that the savvy Intermediaries are using to make people think twice about what they are doing with their own money. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Thanks for the reply, Sal.  I am confident that as my relationships grow the consulting/advisory will take shape.  Great to hear other students are growing their businesses successfully. Proud to be a part of the group!<br>         </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is an update. I spoke with the Bank President again this afternoon. I indicated that we will look at any and all, and here were the fine points I covered.<br><br>1. We like loans, we will look at any and all, however we are not shy about carving out, and that if they are asking for a all-in bid, we are going to looking for loans secured by assets that justify buying the entire portfolio.<br><br>They asked about Fades and I said that is something that could happen, it&#39;s based upon the deal, each strategy is deal specific.<br><br>2. The more information they can provide on the front end results in a smoother bid process and that we are principle bids.<br><br>They asked what we traditionally pay for firsts, seconds, P, NPN, RP and I said every loan is looked at, analyzed, we need to know the story of the deal so everything is deal specific. I then threw this out Sal...<br><br>When you made these loans, every loan decision was made based upon the merits and story of the borrower, the property, the financials, credit standing. You didn&#39;t simply just write a check, so we must be able to make determinations as well.<br><br>I then asked the question of, well how flexible are you going to be on a all-in deal where we may need to kick back some of the loans, are you willing to stand firm on a all-in strategy if allowing some carve outs to make a deal go and they said, we would have to look at the situation if we get there.<br><br>They asked for 7 days to look at what they have closely and see where they stand. I was very encouraged. I am posting this really as an update and to show that if you can become a problem solver while remaining firm, you can get things done.<br><br>Now is there a chance they will choose not to do business? Of course however, I have 57 more banks to call this week and next. I only need one to get some deal flow that can close and make money.<br><br>This was a real confidence builder today.        </p>

          James! Great job. Really appreciate your detail on the deals you are working on- or relationships- actually. I am calling banks as well and making some progress. Have not gotten the replies you have gotten but still have had presidents of banks asking for me to send over an e-mail to let them know what we do and to keep the lines of communication open. Again- thanks for sharing- we can call you- a &quot; mini Sal&quot; lol!        </p>

          Rich,<br>One of the constants I have heard from Sal and learned from is be concise but thorough. I follow the who, what, when, why and how formula when I either speak with someone or email them.. I try to always use the key phrases of does this make sense and I shut up and wait for a reply and that is deal speciific.<br><br>I try not to talk terms because another thing I learned from Sal as well as the time Ive been in the business, once you begin talking terms, the person your speaking with begins to hear what they want to hear, then it&#39;s well you said you pay this or you charge this and if Sal is the capital provider, then your putting him at a pricing disadvantage.<br><br>I have found that bankers talk the talk and walk the I control the deal walk. Its our job to explain to them and show them how in reality, we control the deal.<br><br>As Sal said on The Bulk REO Live program on Day 1, either they want it or they don&#39;t. Its alot easier to approach these bankers when you think in these terms and convey it.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have seen several different tapes in the past week, all different deals, all different assets where some of the assets state FDIC Asset in the comments section.<br><br>Are these treated like any other asset on the tape or are they carved out because they were possibly acquired at an auction where the seller of the pool may not have had the benefit of proper due diligence, modeling of the pool to make the best bid for the pool and priced themselves out of there being any remaining value for that particular asset?        </p>

          How to Get Deals:<br>I just attended the Real Estate Investing Conference in Manhattan, NY and I would like to share with you two important lessons learned. Please note that all speakers (about 15) are well known successful real estate investors/business owners who made a fortune in the financing world.<br>When asked what the key elements of their success were, the answer was:<br>1.  Most of the leads in the financing world come from “relationships”; online, and offline marketing comes next. Obviously it takes time and determination to go out and get a hand shake, but it’s worth it! This was Sal’s advice to me as well: get out of your comfort zone and reach out to bankers, brokers, attorneys, landlords…deals will come exponentially.<br>2.  Never lose focus on what you try to achieve every day, so each time you get distracted, bring yourself back to the task. This is nothing but a mind game to change a habit.<br>All these sound like “common sense”, but it was great to hear it again from successful business owners who started their financial journey like us.<br>Good Luck!<br>Fulga<br>        </p>

          Wonderful Fulga! <br><br>The key takeaway that I think is most important here are *relationships*. <br><br>Let me put this into perspective. None of you on here would buy anything from Dandrew Media if you didn&#39;t have a relationship with us. <br><br>So important today in a world where people are getting blitzed with Social Media. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          James. <br><br>This is something there is no answer for regarding pricing. Every asset is unique and most is contingent upon market prices and time and expense to foreclose on these assets. Those are the drivers for pricing. <br><br>People that want access to the bi-monthly heatmap and pricing model can go here:    <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniett     <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Since asked, what is the minimum amount we look to take down? I was asked if we&#39;ll look at a $10k NP/HELOC or anything in that range.

He is a General Contractor and Realtor. He said that the properties in his city move very fast, and when he finds something, they need to be able to write a check on the spot. He says that he needs committed funds for his $5-8mm projects. He is looking for Equity partners, (which I think is the same as Equity Funding). Can we do something like that? I asked if he has a building under contract, and he said he does not, but with his vast network of Realtors, he could have one in a couple of days. Sounds like a long term customer with repeat business. What do you suggest I do?<br>Thanks!<br>Scott        </p>

          He is an Operator with experience in Commercial Rehab. The question is, is this something we would work with saw an Equity Lender or is an Equity Partner that he is talking about the same thing?        </p>

          He is actually a Licensed Contractor with tons of experience. What he needs is an Equity partner so that he has funds available to move on properties quickly. Do we do anything like this?        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>Need a little clarification re Pref Equity.  In the Structured Products &amp; Equity document you list Commitment Size: $3 - $25 million.  In the email of 3-15-14 about Understanding Mezz Loans vs Preferred Equity one of the points you list is: 7. How Pref and Mezz Amounts Are Calculated. This is something we’ll be doing in slugs of less than $500,000 whereas the market usually won’t go less than $5 million...  <br><br>For an owner who wants to pull some equity out of a property, what is the minimum you will consider?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I won&#39;t post the entire email reply I received today from a bank president post phone call from last week. I found this bank using the FDIC infographic.<br><br>James,<br>I enjoyed our discussion and you made some very good points. Your knowledge of our current position was spot on. When I started the bank I never could have envisioned we would be where we are at today.<br><br>Most phone calls I receive are from entities that have zero business calling in the first place. Your knowledge level is refreshing. Our board has a meeting this week, I believe on Wednesday. I will make it a point to determine what we want to dispose of .<br><br>Will you look at all or do you prefer all non-performing? Please advise on Tuesday. I will look for your call. One remaining question, are you looking to buy on a flow basis? we can turn inventory every thirty (30) until we clear our sheets.<br><br>I posted this to show that what you lay out on the infographic really does work. I received this reply by picking up a telephone and calling. Part if the reason he even spoke with me is because I am direct to the Buyer.        </p>

          To both Sal and James Re: Retail Center in Centennial, Colorado<br><br>Thank you for your responses, your advice would have worked 100% if Time would not Be of Essence: the loan has reached its maturity and there is no time for the land to be sold (Hot Issue as mentioned). Please see my initial comments: The Land sell was the sponsor’s initial strategy, and it was listed last year for $4.5 mil and was under contract for $3.5 mil for 10 months. The deal fell through after 10 months because the buyer did not qualify for the mortgage. Meanwhile the sponsor’s loan has matured and his attorney is finalizing the note buy back at a discount.<br><br>This is a deal where the sponsor is desperate to get the loan to repurchase the note and has enough collateral to minimize the risk. The exit strategy explained included the land sell as a contingency to refinancing.  The only concern here is the fact that the cross-collateral assets are 2 pieces of land in an industrial area, but of a great value that could be sold to experiences developers.<br><br>In case you missed these details, I will ask again: interested?? <br>        </p>

Hassam was discussing REITs and that he thinks that the MF REITs are still good but that he likes the Industrial REITs for more growth. Short but worth watching.        </p>

          Simple. <br><br>Private sellers aren’t as liquid and thus we have to provide what is called a *holdback* (as discussed in your training module) that will allow most of the proceeds to be released to the private seller, *but a portion that will be held back post-closing* for a pre-determined amount of time or until all agreed upon actions have been satisfactorily completed. <br><br>This could mean anything from getting rid of squatters to making sure that the first month’s payments have *all* arrived to the buyer’s offices or servicing company of the buyer’s choosing. <br><br>Or that all *Transfers and Assignments* have been recorded properly, so the buyer is now firmly in place on the chain of title. <br><br>It’s a “carrot and stick” incentive structure for Bulk REO and NPL trades. <br> <br>Sal        </p>

          Fulga, I would sell one of the parcels of land and use those funds to pay down the note. One big question that comes to mind is what are they doing to increase occupancy above 52%. What is their competitive advantage in the market above 52% of the market. <br><br>The project seems to be heading to overleverageville. Sometimes the answer to the problem is not in adding new capital to the capital stack in existence.<br><br>If they own the land outright, I would place both parcels into a separate LLC and syndicate the deal to two developers, and lend the proceeds to the other entity with a long term note with low interest payments that would be lower than taking on new capital.<br><br>Make the money that&#39;s readily available work for them.        </p>

          Sal,<br> I have been working on several deals over night. I wanted to post my email reply to a broker who just insists that I need to deal with them because they are the door to the seller. I think some of the new people could learn how to be firm from this.<br><br>&quot;I will sign a Confidentiality Agreement that is provided directly to my firm from the seller, however I will not sign a NCND/ NDA/Fee Agreement or any other document. The fact that you are asking me to sign your NCND indicates to me that you are not direct to the seller. Is that correct? I don&#39;t discuss deals with anyone other than the seller, period. I don&#39;t deal with sellers reps or brokers. I don&#39;t deal with anyone who is not in the ownership of the assets because there is simply nothing I need to discuss with you or anyone other than the decision maker.<br><br>It is our policy that we speak to the entity that has the legal authority to speak about the assets. During conversations, there is going to be sensitive information provided between buyer and seller entities and legally speaking, if you have not signed a confidentiality agreement with the seller as well as my firm, we are not able to enter into discussions.<br><br>If you are not the seller, I simply will not and can not entertain any business from you. Thank you.&quot;<br><br>This was provided to a broker who thought because they knew who the seller is and I don&#39;t that they were the person who was going to direct the deal.<br><br>There is the saying that the one who has the money leads the deal. I am the one direct to the capital provider and I am the one who controls the deal.<br><br>        </p>

          Ralph. <br><br>You&#39;re assuming that a borrower is cooperative 100% of the time. The #1 reason why a bank or lender would sell a note is because they believe that: <br><br>a) the borrower is not solvent, needs to be replaced. <br><br>b) the borrower is not experienced, ran the project to the ground. Probably doesn&#39;t want to relinquish control. New note owner will foreclose. <br><br>c) bank or lender is afraid that the borrower many file BK. If this is the case, the lender could be thrown over a barrel. Not good. <br><br>d) bank or lender wants a quick closing and feels as though it is faster - and will discount accordingly - the note for a fast and efficient sale to a strong buyer. No need to play carrot and stick with the current borrower. <br><br>e) Probate issues as borrower / operator has died (happens more than you think)<br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>As I sit here working late into the night or actually the morning, I started to read everything here and started to think how it is possible for new people to be viewing videos, thinking about questions and seeking answers and this is a good thing.<br><br>However, I personally feel that anyone who is new to Dandrew needs to be doing some additional things in addition. First thing is to figure out what you want to do with what you are learning. I know that sounds like a really stupid question but pragmatically speaking, it&#39;s a necessity, its a starting point.<br><br>Next, look at what you have in front of you, look at what this opportunity Sal has made available really encompasses. I don&#39;t care if your a banker level person or a private equity person, your opportunities are huge. How huge? lets take a look.<br><br>Banker level-This is the starting level but not the ending level. You could remain a Banker Level Intermediary for the rest of your life and became financially independent very fast. If you close one deal a month and make 2 points up front and those two points equal out to $50,000.00 or even $30,000.00, that is anywhere from $360,000.00 to $600,000.00 per year and that&#39;s just on points, this is not factoring in interest spreads or back end equity pieces.<br><br>Now I stated financially independent, I did not say wealthy or stinking filthy rich. Financially independent simply means writing your own paycheck, never having to punch a time clock, never having to worry about how you will support your family, unless of course you over leverage your lifestyle and that is possible to do, look at the personal bankruptcy court cases filed everyday in this country.<br><br>I won&#39;t delve into all the different levels of opportunities there are here, because this would be so long winded, and that&#39;s not my intention.<br><br>If you look at the big league players in the financial industry and really look closely at what they do and compare it to what you are able to do, provided you take action and go to work, you will see that there is a very close alignment of interests. This is in every opportunity and program Sal makes available.<br><br>The difference between them and you is absolutely zero. Many have MBA&#39;s however, you do to. Maybe it&#39;s not hanging on the wall, however, in terms of Intellectual Capital, you share the same knowledge base. If you look at commercial lenders websites who loan on the same property types as you can, they get their money from institutional investors and funds and simply lend it out. Where do you get your money from? Dandrew and who is Dandrew? a institutional investor/fund. See the alignment  of interests.<br><br>In closing, let me point out a distinction that will give you some motivation. Your competitors went to college and got a high profile degree and it cost them anywhere from $50,000.00 to $200,000.00 and from that educational journey, these very same financial professionals working on the street and within the industry, doing the very same things Sal and Dandrew have provided for $100.00 to $1500.00, are employees of a firm. You own the firm. They may have the title of Vice-President or President or Director of this or that, however at the end of the day, they are punching a time clock so to speak, and at the end of this year, the year after and the year after, they will still be employees. <br><br>This is how huge this is for you, for me, for everyone.        </p>

          Hi Sal and staff. Happy Easter. Was wondering this: is the new bridge loan and structuring that has been implemented- we should copy and paste or put this on our website in lieu of what is there already? Thanks        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>A while back I posted a bridge loan lead in Texas. The developer is seeking $1.5 Mil for a Holiday Inn project. You previously mentioned that I should inquire whether the borrower had obtained an LOI from the franchise. He got back to me, and here was his response:<br><br><br><br>***Email 1***<br><br>Suzette, <br>I would like to close the $1.5 mil. Bridge loan by mid May but know absolute drop dead date. <br>The $11.1 mil. construction loan would be approximately 5 to 6 months later because we will then generate a lot of information we need for the loan during that time including the Franchise. Yes I have talked to Holiday Inn but have not pursued it any further because the next step is to formerly make application and put up my franchise fee, hence Bridge Loan<br><br>***End of Email 1***<br><br><br><br>I responded by communicating the concerns of (1) whether there was anything formalized in writing with the Holiday Inn franchise, and (2) whether there was going to be sufficient time to conduct due diligence prior to closing. Here was his reply:<br><br><br><br><br>***Email 2***<br><br>Suzette,<br>I do not have an LOI from Holiday Inn but have had talks with them and I&#39;m sure in my mind I can get their flag. If your folks wanted to make some type of financing commitment based on an acceptable Franchise then I think we could work with that. <br><br>I assume you must be thinking the construction loan or are you thinking the Bridge Loan. The Bridge Loan decision should not take very long but if you are thinking construction also Then maybe you should look at doing the Bridge with a deal worked out up front on construction loan that would give you the first rights to the construction loan at your option. Anyway I&#39;m just brain storming so give me your thoughts.<br><br>***End of Email 2***<br><br><br><br><br>Sal, your input would be appreciated. <br><br>Before I begin assembling the five data points on this deal, I want to be sure that I am not wasting my time. If this deal shows possibility for Dandrew, under what conditions would this borrower be fund-able? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Suzette<br>        </p>

          Suzette: <br><br>Ground up construction for hospitality, the size of this deal (1.5mm) isn&#39;t really that attractive not just to us, but just at about any institution. <br><br>Good push back regarding the COmmittment Letter from Holiday Inn.

          Sal, I should clarify. This is not ground-up construction; but rather, the redevelopment and re-positioning of an existing structure. It is a value-add hospitality project with a local and experienced operator at the helm; this is according to the borrower&#39;s resume and project summary. <br><br>My question is...that if this guy obtains a formal written commitment from the flag franchise first, then would  Dandrew be interested in taking a look at this deal or talking to the guy? Would this deal be worth the investment of time that it would take for me to assemble the five data points?  <br><br>The main issue with this deal is that the property is under contract without a solid commitment from a flag. This does not leave much time for obtaining an LOI from a flag prior to closing. Another issue I see is that it is a $1.5 Mil loan; and not your $2 Mil minimum. A loan request can always be raised to meet a lender&#39;s minimum; however...a question comes to mind regarding the tight closing deadline and written commitment from the flag:<br><br>(1) Could a loan commitment be made subject to borrower obtaining an extension of closing sufficient for lender to complete due diligence; and then condition the funding of escrow on borrower submitting written evidence of commitment from intended flag franchise? <br><br>Just thinking &quot;outside the box.&quot; I need to know how to respond to this borrower. If there are conditions that this particular borrower would have to satisfy in order for this deal to be more feasible to you, then I would like to know what  it is, so that I can communicate this to the borrower. He will either make it happen, or he will not. <br><br>What would this borrower need to do in order to warrant a phone conversation with Dandrew about his bridge loan request? This would seem a logical first step. Please advise.<br><br>The clarity would be appreciated.<br><br>Thanks again,<br><br>Suzette        </p>

          Suzette: <br><br>Some of your comments need some corrective guidance here. <br><br>*1. Would this deal be worth the investment of time that it would take for me to assemble the five data points?*<br><br>This is something you ask for. It doesn’t take time to “assemble”. You’re not putting together a sophisticated model here. Just asking the guy who is supposed to be smart enough to give you these answers if he is asking for millions of dollars… <br><br>2. We just passed on a flagged Hilton in Hartford, CT because one of our lead LPs – who is located in CT – wasn’t bullish on Hartford. <br><br>So, *where is this hotel located?*<br><br>3. Why is this hotel under contract without a flag? What is this guy’s Plan B? <br><br>4. Tell me what you mean by “a loan request can always be raised to meet a lender’s minimum? If I have a car that I can buy for 1.5mm and its worth 2mm, would you lend me 2mm? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>1. Ok, got it. Five data points are automatic.<br><br>2. Project is located in Tyler, TX<br><br>3. I will ask the borrower why the hotel is under contract without a flag; and whether he has a Plan B in place.<br><br>4. With regards to a borrower raising a loan request, it depends on the value of the deal.  When I made that statement I was thinking in terms of loan-to-value of this deal. The contract is $5,000,000.00; and assuming the property value is $5,000,000.00; a $2,000,000.00 loan would be a 40% loan-to-value. <br><br>It seems logical that a low loan-to-value and short-term loan would be attractive to a lender; because in theory, such a loan should carry less risk than a longer-term bridge loan at higher loan-to-value. <br><br>By the way, I&#39;m not claiming that $5,000,000.00 is the value of the property; I&#39;m just explaining my logic.<br><br>Suzette<br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was on the entire call today and even sat through the Q and A until I had a client call coming in that I had to take. Great call, very informative as always.<br><br>I wanted to pass on something you said to me when we did a call a few months back about a fund idea. I took note of everything you told me, but this stood out.<br><br>I think those who are new need to understand something. You must know your deal and you must be passionate because you believe in the deal.<br><br>There are deals located that you just know will never fly and you don&#39;t get passionate about and then there are deals that will surface that you just know are worth doing.<br><br>A guy on the call today was not prepared to talk about a deal. I think we all saw how that went down. Sal and AJ were very nice when others would not have been.<br><br>All the spreadsheet templates, the five data points and other tools you have at your disposal are for the purpose of crafting the presentation to investors and funders for your deal. It all starts with the five data points and evolves from there.<br><br>The five data points gives you a birds eye view of the deal. What is the significance of the current NOI? well the debt service payments come out of this and it shows where the properties financials are. What  is the stabilized or Pro Forma? This is going to show where the project can be financially over time.<br><br>What&#39;s the debt stack? Will adding new capital cause the property to be over leveraged? In other words, will new capital put the property in danger of not making debt service. Sources and uses, the story behind the deal, exit strategy.<br><br>You must know this, it&#39;s a huge part of knowing the deal. One thing you also have to understand is what is the best deal structure? meaning, does the project lend itself to a refi? will bringing in a JV partner be more appropriate?<br><br>The guy on the call was talking about a multi family in Fort Worth, Texas, 186 units, 80% occupancy and he mentioned Loop Net, also known as hospice for deals. Just because it&#39;s 186 units and 80% occupied does not mean anyone will jump at this deal.<br><br>Most investors will compare a deal like this to others in the market. They will look at what&#39;s available for sale, what is the class of the asset, meaning is it A, B or C. The biggest question will always be, do I spend $2,000,000.00 for 186 units at 80% occupancy and a class C property that needs rehab, new management, new signage, extensive advertising and marketing to get occupancy raised or do I invest $2,850,000.00 for 240 units in a class A property where it&#39;s pretty much turn key.<br><br>You must ask yourself, if I had the capital available whether it&#39;s through a combination of my own or a partners equity and a new first or whatever the capital stack is, would I buy this deal? you have to look past dollars and cents because pragmatically, the deal just may not be worth doing.<br><br>Just my two cents Sal.        </p>

          Allways enjoy the conference calls!  Thanks for all those clear, specific answers!  <br><br>I was digesting the answers to my two vocabulary questions (buy debt and fresh paper) when I realized I still had 2 more questions, so here they are.<br><br>1) Does DanDrew buy debt?  I thought no, but you seemed to say yes.<br><br>2) Does DanDrew table fund?  If so, Just how wouold that work?        </p>

          Jeraldine. <br><br>First, *it&#39;s Dandrew*. Do people spell your name &quot;JeralDine&quot;? <br><br>1. Yes. We buy debt. Debt is loans. Credit is loans. <br><br>2. That means different things to different people. We can set this up if their monthly volume is $10mm per month and can show that they have had a history of doing that for at least 3 months at that volume. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on a call I had today. I spoke with a company that buys seconds from banks directly. They have been doing this full time since 2007.<br><br>They buy anywhere from 1000 to 10000 per month. Anything that does not fit into their portfolio, they will sell which is generally about 20 to 30% of the new inventory monthly. They work the files and hold in their own portfolio. They don&#39;t set junk aside and keep the best stuff, they simply liquidate what doesn&#39;t work for them.<br><br>They own the notes and they use a company in Virginia to house all the files and it&#39;s a fee for service situation with the holding house.<br><br>What I said to the CEO of the firm on the call is as follows:<br><br>We are backed by a large and successful fund that likes these types of opportunities and I am certain they would enjoy doing business over the long term. The pricing will be on a deal by deal basis. I have a follow up call on Monday of next week to fine tune the relationship.<br><br>They stated that they get opportunities to acquire first liens but since their entire business model focuses on seconds, they pass. I said we would have a interest in dealing with them on the firsts.<br><br>See you on the call.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Was wondering- is it possible to have more than one pref equity in cap stack? If so- who would get paid first? Are these recorded docs? I know they are not loans- but is payback in accordance with recordation? Might seem silly but was wondering this for a while. It seems to me there can only be one pref equity deal in stack but am not positive. Thanks!        </p>

          It is an excellent question. *Please ask this on the call*. <br><br>Larger deals, like skyscrapers in Manhattan, SF and Chicago can have Sr. Pref, Jr. Pref. Its just adding more buckets under the waterfall. <br><br>For deals less than 100mm, it doesn&#39;t exist. And these aren&#39;t recorded docs because as you know, Richard, being a Mezz vs. Pref professional like you are, you know that these aren&#39;t recorded (secured) docs. They are just collateralized by control and remedies in the LLC&#39;s Operating Agreement. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS. Want to be a mezz vs. pref professional like Richard? Go here: <br>  <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniueo <br>Sal        </p>

          I receive lots of deals in regards to financing - refinancing, Is there a particular area you are concentrating on? If so, can I receive criteria or some place in our resources I may have overlooked. I have the private identity kit already;  just trying to weed out and narrow my marketing.  I receive deals financing of SFR, SFR Refinancing, Commercial Financing/Refinancing, SFR Construction, and Commercial Development.        </p>

          Great question:<br><br>Right now, the writer who puts all of the pieces together in a coherent format is working on our JGMellon.com site (AJ&#39;s). He became ill with an &quot;acute lodged bowel&quot; and he couldn&#39;t hold food and needed surgery. <br><br>Once he finishes that, he is moving onto the REO and Private Banker website content. He has everything he needs, but I have to depend on him to get this done. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>This article was published by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Tuesday. It seems that bankers are making loans to Commercial and Multifamily to the tune of $358 Billion in 2013. This seems like a significant increase in lending  which would suggest that lenders have relaxed their underwriting requirements.......or is this just a small percentage of market share going to the crem-de-la-crem sponsor ?<br><br>(Article from front page of the MBA website)<br><br>WASHINGTON, DC (April 8, 2014) – Commercial and multifamily mortgage bankers closed $358.5 billion of loans in 2013 according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) 2013 Commercial Real Estate/Multifamily Finance Annual Origination Volume Summation.<br><br>Commercial bank and savings institutions were the leading investor group for whom loans were originated in 2013, responsible for $100.5 billion of the total.  CMBS issuers saw the second highest volume, $79.8 billion, and were followed by life insurance companies and pension funds; Fannie Mae; REITS, mortgage REITS and investment funds; and Freddie Mac.<br><br>In terms of property types, multifamily properties saw the highest origination volume, $136.9 billion, followed by office buildings, retail properties, hotel/motel, industrial, and health care.  First liens accounted for 97 percent of the total dollar volume closed.<br><br>“Improving property markets and a strong appetite among lenders led to a very active year in commercial real estate finance,” said Jamie Woodwell, MBA’s Vice President of Commercial Real Estate Research.  “Multifamily rental properties drew the most financing, and banks and thrifts were the largest source of commercial real estate lending.  Despite the fact there are fewer maturing loans in need of refinancing this year, originations should continue to be buoyed by higher property values, rising property incomes and still low interest rates.”<br><br>Driven in part by increased coverage, the reported dollar volume of commercial and multifamily mortgages closed in 2013 was 47 percent higher than the volume reported in 2012.  Among repeat participants in the survey, the dollar volume of closed loans rose by 22 percent.         </p>

          Chris. <br><br>It is very sweet to us private capital sources. Very sweet. These larger banks now have to jump through a larger hoop and are still sore from paying billions in fines related to poor lending practices. <br><br>You are in the best niche in the industry now. The best that it has ever been. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, in reading some of the posts here, I&#39;ve come to see that a lot if the members are new and trying bulk deals. I applaud everyone for being here and working to make it big.<br><br>I wanted to pass this on as a few tricks I use to determine if I&#39;m dealing with a untrained Intermediary and determining if they are as direct as they want me to believe.<br><br>First question I ask is, so your direct to the seller? Usual answer is yes.<br><br>Next question is, who is the seller? Usual answer is can&#39;t provide that right now and my question us, why not<br><br>My statement than becomes, okay, well are they an individual, family office looking to divest, bank, usual answer is cannot provide that right now.<br><br>Next question is, when can you? Usual answer is always something like, when you submit a LOI and POF.<br><br>Next question is? Letter of interest or Letter of Intent. There is a difference. Letter of Interest just says you are interested and under what terms you usually buy at, it&#39;s very vanilla in nature. Letter of intent spells out what terms you&#39;ll buy at and what price you would buy at if everything meets your needs.<br><br>Next statement is, if your direct to the seller than you have a agreement for compensation in place and usually they say yes.<br><br>My next statement than becomes, well if this is the case than even if I went around you direct, you would be protected anyway no matter what, because if your direct and your the only one who has this deal, than the seller, who you have an agreement with knows I got the deal direct from you.<br><br>At this point, I usually have outed them and their only thing to cling to is a POF and I say well since we have already concluded you are not direct than I&#39;m not sending you a POF, I will send it to the seller at the proper stage, where do I send it to and usually this is when they confirm they are not direct because they can&#39;t tell you who the seller is, they only know who they got the deal from.<br><br>My next question is how many points are you getting in the deal and usually they say something like its 50 or 40 plus 3. I then call them out again by saying ok, what are you doing that&#39;s worth three points? Usually I get any myriad of replies.<br><br>I lead the call, I ask pointed questions, I listen to the replies, I listen to the tones in the other persons voice, I listen for tells, which is what professional poker players do when they are sizing up their co-players.<br><br>From the call I can tell if I am dealing with a novice or a seasoned player, a Intermediary or even a direct seller. Yes, sometimes you will get a seller who is great as a buyer but terrible as a seller.<br><br>You have to qualify the deal and you have to begin by qualifying the parties in the deal. You must know who your working with. Sorry this is long winded.        </p>

          Sal is my pal. Listen. Talking to this one guy-( not bank) swears he is the seller of these notes but wants POF and LOI ahead of time. Hate to keep bringing it up but this guy found my site and all. I told him we absolutely do not do LOI or POF before we even know what we are buying. He stated that they need this because they do not want all this information sent out like before when buyers who were not really buyers- shopped it around and all this non sense.<br><br>I said we will will sign  CA and that should suffice and we handle the info with respect and all. Left it at that. He swears he is the seller.<br>Standing my ground though. Not biting on this. The man with the money makes the rules. lol!!!<br><br>Banks will be calling me soon and I am following up with them as well as starting to call HML&#39;S. Love this stuff.<br><br>Thanks for all you and staff do! <br><br>        </p>

          Richard, I&#39;m dealing with this too just yesterday and I called this guy out. Here is what I did. I asked Letter of Interest or Letter of Intent, he said LOI, I said letter that I&#39;m interested or that I plan to buy. He said plan to buy.<br><br>I said sorry, don&#39;t issue that until I see what were looking at. I said ok so if I give this to you, then I can have the tape in less than 5 minutes right, he said, no we have to vet you. I said hmmm interesting. I&#39;m showing you I want to buy and I have the money and you want to vet me. I said if your direct or your the seller, you should have the tape right in front of you or in your files.<br><br>I played dumb and said well what&#39;s vetting, he said qualifying you. I said, I thought LOI and POF did that. I said look pal, I can call any bank in this country, ask if they have any loans they want to move off their balance sheet and have the tape in 24 to 48 hours or even in 5 minutes from the end of the call and I won&#39;t have to provide a POF up front and maybe just have to sign a NDA.<br><br>I told him your not dealing with an amateur here but I am. I wished him luck and said next call.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was going to email you about this deal, but I decided to post it here, because I really think this would be a good deal for others to learn from.<br><br>This is the Orlando, Florida deal I mentioned last week here. It is not a Bulk REO deal but rather a bulk property deal. Here is the breakdown of the numbers and specifics.<br><br>1) Portfolio consists of 43 Sfr&#39;s in Orlando, Sanford, Apopka, Daytona, Deland and Mount Dora. Property prices/values range between the $40k&#39;s and $166K. All professionally rehabbed.<br><br>2)  This is a all-deal no carve outs permitted. Seller ask is $3,100,000.00 but property prices are showing to be cumulative at $ 2, 673,000.00. Has received an offer at $2.7 M but I believe that to be a pricing tactic trick to generate an offer closer to ask. However, seller is flexible on offer.<br><br>3)  NOI is at $332,000.00 annually with the cap rate close to 11%. Monthly rents are below market at $27, 140.00.<br><br>4) Market rent is at $459,660.00 annually or $38,305.00 with a cap rate at market of 15% and allowing for a 5% vacancy.<br><br>The upside on this deal is that the rents are below market and once raised to market, will generate a monthly income increase of about $11,100.00. Orlando is a good market to be in and can be considered a Tier-1 City.<br><br>The properties have already been rehabbed professionally within last 12 to 36 months.<br><br>The downside to this deal is that the properties are not all at the $60K mini asset value. They are sfr&#39;s and produce 1 income stream as opposed to a multi family which has multiple income streams and if one tenant vacates, there is remaining income in place. The properties have already been rehabbed so from that perspective, there is no value add component so the value add would be in the immediate or near immediate increase of rents. <br><br>Is this a deal that Dandrew or Dave Gordon would have or share an interest in? Should I submit it? Any thoughts?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Great question. We&#39;re not (and no one I know of) is going to be a bid on this as there is a lot of *&quot;rougher product&quot;*, or *&quot;smaller balance&quot;* stuff on here that isn&#39;t desirable for institutions. <br><br>However, all is not lost though. At the event Dave Gordon will be talking about how to cross these with *individual retail investors*.<br><br>Individual rehab investors will buy these all day long. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, what steps can I take to insure &#39;hope certificates&#39; become &#39;sure bets&#39;.  Not only am I structuring the financing (whether it&#39;s bridge financing or existing debt) I am the one who has found the opportunity as well as the one who&#39;s introducing it to a qualified sponsor/operator.  My intent is to play the role of a promoter in order to gain operator experience; rather than just being a capital provider, who collects passive interest.  I want to be involved more and have my compensation reflect that....how do I protect my interest as a promoter.<br><br>I sort of have my equiteer hat on...what warrants me asking to be on all levels of the capital structure (normal stack water fall that is - pref, promote, and debt) <br><br>Mainly, how do I structure the pref and promote to keep the sponsor interested and motivated.  Like I said I&#39;m bringing the deal and capital; it might seem to even ask for skin in the game from the sponsor to make it more of a commitment.<br><br>Thank you<br>Hurol        </p>

          Hurol! <br><br>Regarding this question: *“Sal, what steps can I take to insure ‘hope certificates’ become ‘sure bets’”*<br><br>Sal says: Simple. Make sure you have the best qualified operator who will bring the deal across the home plate. Does this guy have the grit and determination to bring it through? <br><br>*&quot;My intent is to play the role of a promoter in order to gain operator experience; rather than just being a capital provider, who collects passive interest.”*<br><br>Sal says: Absolutely! And that is what you *should* be doing! <br><br>*”Mainly, how do I structure the pref and promote to keep the sponsor interested and motivated.”*<br><br>Sal says: I think you need to make sure he’s bringing something to the table. Something of significance to him/her. That is how they stay motivated as they have skin in the game. Otherwise, they have to be in at such a low basis that they don’t want to lose the deal. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal. Hope all is well on this Sunday. Question real quick. I am a P.E. since 1-23-14. Wondering since I am studying the bulk reo and arbitrager program thoroughly- is there a means to get a matrix for pricing all these notes or do we need to belong to Ask Dandrew Silver for this? I can use common sense when getting back pricing expectations on a tape- but knowing a matrix would be more ammo! lol! Thanks much......        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have gone through the DIP course and I have a question in relation to the Harlem deal. For DIP financing, the property needs to have equity, correct? The property in Harlem came back as worth a little more (not much) than what the note holder was due (no discount). I am unclear as to why we were unable to help him.         </p>

          I do understand that part of it. But if we brought equity to the deal to complete the construction, the value at that point would be significantly higher. I&#39;m just looking to understand that part of the DIP financing (value added) concept whether it is this project or another.        </p>

          If they have equity wouldn&#39;t they have gotten a loan earlier to pay off some of their debt? Or is it because they couldn&#39;t qualify for a loan because they messed up their credit or couldn&#39;t service their debt? Am I understanding this correctly?        </p>

          I could not make the call today. What I was asking was, just like an apartment complex that might need some fixing up to help increase occupancy and thereby creating more value, if bringing equity to the table and use it to complete the construction, would that not increase value?  <br>Using made up numbers, if a property is worth $3.5mm and property owner owes $3.1mm to one creditor and $1mm to others and construction costs of $5mm brings the property value up to $15mm, is this something that Dandrew would consider?        </p>

          Molly<br><br>Great question.  Sometimes we buy notes, and do workouts with the borrowers. <br><br>Regarding financing the note, sometimes people will come to us to buy their note back at a discount. That is essentially refinancing the note. <br><br>The only real material difference is *who’s in control*: meaning, if we “refinancing”, the operator is strong and is still in control. <br><br>If we buy the note, the operator has issues and we’re looking to get control of the asset via foreclosure or to help the borrower out buy either re-casting the note (new term) or a principal reduction because we bought that at a discount. <br><br>I hope this answers your question. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          But what about the REO&#39;s no operators and some of them residential .   What do we do with those?  Do we have to have a &quot;buyer&quot; in line for the property before we will buy the bulk of these REO since we don&#39;t &quot;buy anything&quot;?         </p>

          During the last Ask Dandrew call I briefly mentioned my idea of a new group which would be for those of us who have found someone who wants a specific type of property or if we have found something to sell.<br><br>I think that this could be another group just like the others in The Dandrew Community.  This way the information is located in one spot and not lost in all of the conversations and replies.<br><br>In the last AskDandrew Silver call Dave said David has a buyer for preforming loans and that if anyone had some that David should be contacted. Dave could not offer product at the yield the purchaser wanted.<br><br>I have found a private equity fund that buys sale-leaseback for single tenant office and warehouse.  They are also interested in larger medical groups in their own building.<br><br>Since we are all big boys and girls, it would be up to us to have a ND-NC and fee splitting agreement before moving forward to match people up. Also since nothing is free, I think that our sending Dandrew 1% or so of any fees generated to cover the cost of maintaining this group would be appropriate.<br><br>Let me know if there is any interest in this.  I was contacted by another Dandrew member to discuss this and he suggested that this might be able to be done as a private group on Linkedin.<br><br>Please let me know if there is any interest in this.        </p>

          Sal and Jack, while I am always open to doing business with professionals and I view everyone here as professionals because of the training they have been and are receiving, I am reluctant to give this a green light.<br><br>The main reason is because most here don&#39;t have funding sources outside of Dandrew. There are a few here with funding sources outside of Dandrew I sense but not many. I am against the fence on this.<br><br>I however am not opposed to having members email addresses listed, so if someone has a deal that is outside Dandrew&#39;s wheelhouse, a member can reach out to others.        </p>

          Rich here - We would welcome the opportunity to leverage the Intellectual Capital and the alternate funding sources that we have acquired in the years that Sal has been Mentoring in order to us to work with other members on deals that fall outside of the Dandrew wheelhouse.<br><br>Four or five years ago when we had our &quot;Day With Sal&quot; I had no knowledge of any of this world; and thanks to Sal&#39;s teachings (and patience) and Brenda&#39;s MBA, background and intelligence we now have associations with a number of other fund managers and private lenders; Term Sheets out, have started our own fund, and are actively marketing for more funding opportunities.<br><br>That said, we have also learned how to ask &quot;What Does A Bag Of Groceries Weigh?&quot; when we receive requests like &quot;Here is the Loopnet sheet - will you loan on this property?&quot;; so please follow Sal&#39;s Mentoring, start with the Five Data Points, etc. and keep acquiring more and more Intellectual Capital from Sal about all aspects of this fascinating world.<br><br>Please feel free to contact me at Rich@DusekNetwork.com - a.k.a. &quot;The Motor City Big-Mouth&quot; - (248) 705-1022        </p>

          My best friend locates NPN.  She will be getting up to $25mil in within a few days.  Usually all the states are gone except New York and Florida when she received them.  But if the buying source proof up the seller drops the little guys and sale all the NPN to that buyer.  That’s why she loses her deals because her buyers can’t compete with the big buyers.  Our company is interested in buying NPN and I’m interested in closing on some of these deals.  We need our buyer to proof up; need $25mil POF from our buying source to participate.  She has been working the market for over a year. I want to take advantage of it for the team.  Can you inform me how to proceed with Dandrew proofing up and being the buyer.        </p>

          Glen<br><br>As you know, after some disingenuous people have abused the POF and has cost me $10,000 in legal expense to defend, we have placed a moratorium on issuing the POFs. <br><br>With that said, we would never deliver a $25mm POF. No one would believe a student would have $25mm. <br><br>Conventionally with other firms, to do this would require $5mm held in escrow and a review of financials, credit, criminal, educational, and everything else you can think of. Therefore, qualifying for this is not as easy as you think. <br><br>If you have a contact with a seller, and not a broker, compiler or otherwise, send over to deals@ their contact info and we will call them and offer them the requisite info if needed. <br><br>*My hunch is that you&#39;re dealing with someone who isn&#39;t direct, and you &quot;know a gal who knows a guy...&quot; and that isn&#39;t something neither you nor I want.*<br><br>Additionally, *you need to be an Arbitrager* to submit these deals, and you&#39;re not currently an Arbitrager. In the Arbitrager course, we go over this at length as to how to submit these deals. <br><br>To upgrade, go to www.AJsATeam.com. <br><br>Thank you<br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Is it true the hedge funds buys notes.  I was talking about the company buying them and verifying whatever needed. I&#39;ll be on the conference call today. I&#39;m going to specialize in the Dip  and Hard Money purchase program.  I&#39;m still learning the process.  I&#39;ll look into becoming a Arbitrager.  I&#39;m not really interested in notes.  But I can be  if I locate a deal. Thank you.        </p>

          Sal, I have a tape with 64 assets to submit and have gone over the details. It appears to be missing UPB, Original Loan Amount, Loan Purpose and Loan Type. I&#39;ve spoken with the Seller and they&#39;ve said that &quot;We don&#39;t generally review that information with investors up front but  more or less “credit DD” after the initial “value DD”. BI reports are working on 2 other projects right now and are a few days out from any new request being reviewed. I can supply that information to the best of our knowledge (we might be lacking some data) but I need to make sure we are on the same page with values to make sure we have a possibility of a trade. <br><br>Please advise of your rough values. Once we verify we are on the same page, I can run the report on the deals we could agree on. It will possibly be a few days however.&quot;<br><br>How do you want me to respond?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Danny<br>        </p>

          This guy is Note Trade Desk Manager that is well known in Orange County as a purveyor of scratch and dent mortgage notes. They are the seller. He was referred to me by one of my previous contacts in mortgage banking with Finance America, Ameriquest Mortgage, Option One, New Century Financial who is now REO Manager. They were written up in OC Register a couple of times so I know there legit. Nevertheless, I will slap the guy around and call him silly for thinking we could price the tape missing that much information. Thanks, Sal.        </p>

          His response to the bag of groceries query as follows:<br><br>&quot;The value of the real estate is what I m looking for from you. The loan data has nothing to do with the value of the real estate. If we do not agree on the value of the real estate,  we wouldn&#39;t agree on trade price.

          Ah. OK. I knew this may happen. Here is what is going on behind the scenes: <br><br>What he wants to do is for you to mark his books for him. He doesn&#39;t want to sell, he wants to do the equivalent of listing a home to see what he can get for it. But has 0 intention of actually selling the assets. <br><br>So, he wants us to do the heavy lifting so he can say &quot;no thanks&quot;, then tell his board what the &quot;bid&quot; was for these assets.  <br><br>*Run away.*         </p>

          So I shamed him and he responded with the following:<br><br>    I don’t understand what you mean by “marking your books” so I can tell the board what the bid for the assets were? We are interested in selling. We wanted to make sure we are on the same page with “ballpark values” not BPOs not exact values. It is nothing similar to listing a home with no intention of selling. It is verifying whether or not you are wasting my time. We are a legitimate seller and it is unknown whether you are a legitimate buyer. If we can’t agree on the value of the real estate we would more than likely not agree on bids. I am not asking for values on each and every asset just the assets you are interested in. If you are a legitimate buyer, and you were interested in purchasing these assets, you would at least look into the value of the assets you are interested in. we do not set a price on assets as they are moving targets and generally are out to other investors for bids and offers. This is how we operate and if you have an issue with how we operate there are other institutions you can attempt to purchase from.      <br><br>        </p>

          Sal, Is there a sample tape of what you&#39;re looking for that we can share with the banks that we&#39;re dialing up. The reason I ask is that they&#39;re is a tremendous amount of lack of trust. The words performing and nonperforming notes seems to shut people off and I get shuffled off into voicemail. Thanks.        </p>

           We&#39;ve got 4 tapes coming over next week with names and numbers of people at the bank. The board is looking for a commitment that when we deliver we get paid. Do you have something I can share with them in writing that you&#39;re committed to do without blinders on? The reason I ask is because we&#39;re trying to figure out what the probability is that we can actually close these deals. We&#39;re spending $8k per month on infrastructure and salaries for assistants to get you what you want. Just need a little help here. Thanks in advance.        </p>

          Sal, is their a module on how to upload these tapes? <br><br>The reason I ask is because I&#39;ve hired 3 people to source these tapes and am out thousands of dollars and would hate to lose our relationship on the deal submission.<br><br> It&#39;s imperative that my firm (Global Realty &amp; Investment dba Versailles)  not be put on the &quot;No Fly&quot; list. So any input you can give would be great. <br><br>Question: I&#39;m assuming that you attach the portfolio to where it asks to upload the commercial photo? <br><br>Thanks, Danny        </p>

          Done. <br><br>Also, I met face to face with the bank that wanted us to mark their books and apparently they don&#39;t want to waste any time if our value and their value are not close to one another. I personally know the head of Loss Mitigation and he told his Note Desk Manager to get us the information that you want to make a decision. We will queue that up for you soon.<br><br>When are you available for 5 minutes to take my call? The reason I ask is because this venture is taking off and I have just a few questions I was hoping you could answer?<br><br>Danny        </p>

          Please help me better understand your response to Glenn Saffary’s request for Proof of Funds: “With that said, we would never deliver a $25mm POF. No one would believe a student would have $25mm”<br>My interpretation of your response is that we present ourselves as “students” while calling banks, brokers, etc. I would imagine nobody would spend time dealing with students, and the whole purpose of the Credibility Kit is to prove the world that we are serious players. <br>Please help me understand if there is any update in the program that I am not aware of.<br>Thank you<br>        </p>

          I am going to because I have Sal&#39;s blessing post something later today about my experiences in being in a live deal with Sal. I will say that the last time I looked, Sal has made it very clear that the POF when issued were only for $2M and was only available to Private Equiteer and Arbitragers.<br><br>One thing I have learned about Sal is like it or hate it, he is brutally honest and tells it like it is. I don&#39;t sense that Sal refers to anyone as just a student and feels that  no one would believe any Intermediaries wouldn&#39;t have that kind of money, but lets face reality here. Not one Intermediary here has $25,000,000.00 in their bank account.<br><br>This is my two cents<br><br>I        </p>

          Sal,<br>I need some guidance on a deal I&#39;m going to look at Thursday. This is direct from the sellers. 45 properties that are off market, all tenanted, all properties have been professionally rehabbed over course of past 36 months, located in Orlando, Florida.<br><br>Where I need the guidance is in what the minimum asset value you need to see in that market for bidding and what would be the mindset of Dandrew if the properties were priced below market but had a value where you needed each asset to be.<br><br>They have several deals they want to get done, however this particular deal is a priority for them, reason unknown until the call.        </p>

          Sal - My take away is that we are in the right place. <br><br>All forms of money will at &lt;strong&gt;least &lt;/strong? be concerned with this sort of activity. At &lt;strong&gt;most, &lt;/strong&gt;run from it. Where will it run? If we&#39;re in the business of establishing funds, raising or placing capital in an imperfect market, using a clearly defined and well bounded vehicle, then we are in position to provide a safe haven to money that&#39;s concerned about, or running from, nonsense like this. <br><br>I would incorporate a reference to this in my dialog with funding sources and use it in conversation to point out that the grass is in many ways greener on our side of the fence. It also demonstrates that we are sensitive to what&#39;s going on in the industry. <br><br>This highlights the latest of many nails in the Wall Street coffin. <br><br>Sorry for not reading your email. I&#39;ve had to prepare for an important meeting in Vegas. Those guys can be brutal.         </p>

          Hi Sal. Hope you are well. I have been calling banks and leaving messages, speaking with some folks, etc. Nothing concrete yet but I wanted to share with other intermediaries as well the experience so far. It seems getting through the &quot; gatekeeper&quot; is a little challenging and they put you on hold and you have to get connected to several different people as well a lot of times before you get the right one. It is all good but a lot of patience is required. A lot of the receptionists do not understand who to send me to. I am asking for the whole loan sales dept, loss mitigation, or mortgage dept, etc. Do you have some different verbiage when being connected to the right dept.? I am sure I am asking it right and feel comfortable on the phone- but a lot of these people just do not understand much. Any suggestions on what dept. to ask for or phrase it differently? Thanks and have a great day!!!!        </p>

          Richard. <br><br>I would speak to the CFO or the Chief Credit Officer (who may also be called the &quot;Treasurer&quot;). <br><br>I&#39;m recording calls this week with someone who is spending a Day With Sal.

          We are working with a fund manager who loans on gas stations (have two term sheets out on them now).  That said, if there is  a buyer needing financing it is one thing, but a property/business going to foreclosure auction is way different than a buyer who has a property under contract looking for financing.

          Sal,<br>New update on what I posted last night. The deal for the Philadelphia Reo&#39;s is 61 properties in the Philadelphia suburbs with some Philadelphia City properties mixed in. The bank asset manager informed me that we can do a carve out because a few of the properties are land but if we wanted to go all-in, they are ready to get creative. They&#39;re looking to get $6.3 million for the entire portfolio.<br><br>The portfolio is from a small regional bank. They can be flexible on time to close. They are motivated to sell and their expectations on what the properties will actually net them off of gross dollars generated from the sell has been bought to a level of complete understanding across the board. In other words, they know they may not get as high a bid as they would like to have had but they are ok.<br><br>The NPN portfolio of firsts, the updated spreadsheet is okay, nothing to get excited about. They are flexible, we will just have to look at the spreadsheet. I think we could get by initially with a handle. On properties $40K and below, they are at 30%, $40K to 60K at 45% and above $60K at 50%. These are their expected target offers.<br><br>I will keep you updated.        </p>

          The DIP Scripts talk about setting a meeting up with a manager with the Chapter 11 financing decision maker. I have the info and list to call but want to confirm how and when we set these meeting ups I presume with you or AJ with the Law firms. Right now I feel like I am all dressed up but with no where to party. Let me know if there is a calender or how we know good times to set up these meeting. Thanks        </p>

The script says if they say that if they may have a future need you say You can visit our website at dandrewpartners.com for more information about us and to download materials about our services.

          I ran across a deal that needs 10 million dollars in development financing. The project is part of a 23 acre development that includes a Hampton Inn flagged hotel, a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant, and business offices. The project is for a microbrewery/restaurant combination to be built on an 8 acre site and includes 3.5 million in incentives from the city.  All the other projects have separate financing in place and the construction is due to start in April. To avoid taking on any debt that comes along with bank financing, the owners were trying to raise money from investors in China through the federal EB-5 program. The deal fell apart due to the fact that the owners were not able to raise the funds fast enough to meet the timeline the city recommended.<br><br>The owner was offering all of his investors equity in the deal and already has one successful award winning microbrewery/restaurant in the Chicagoland area. The city borders the Illinois state line and is approximately 20 minutes from downtown Chicago so it is considered one of its suburbs even though it is in a different state.  The microbrewery and the other developments will be located right off the 80/94 expressway and right across the street from another long standing development that includes three Marriott flagged hotels and two restaurants. <br><br>I have relationship with one of the directors of the Hammond Economic Development commission so we may be able to resurrect this deal.  She is forwarding over the owners&#39; information to me today to see if I can assist them. I will be very thorough with my information gathering so you will most likely end up with more information than the mandatory five data points.  My question is could this be something that Dandrew would be interested in being an equity participant?          </p>

          Sal. Good day to you. I had a tape sent over to me- someone found my site, etc- not the seller so not interested but I am curious about what it stated on it. The tape was called &quot; DEFICIANCY LOANS&quot;. They all had gone through F.C. but I looked up def. loans and could not really find anything- except agricultural definition! lol! I understand the def. judgements but have never heard of this. Is this just an error in description??? Thanks        </p>

          Sal,<br>For whatever reason I seem to be getting deals from this company that builds Assisted Living Facilities that wants to do mezz deals. They are experienced, 29 years and 30 developments later they are finding they need to go this route.<br><br>They do things this way. They line up bank funding for the first lien, and they bring real cash equity to the deal and they plan to go get a mezz piece bought in to round out the capital and debt stack. They use the 1 to 3 term model to refi out or straight sell asset to get the mezz team out. The funds from the mezz piece is used to finish out construction and lease up hard costs.<br><br>Can we make a play here. They meet the hard criteria of being experienced, being involved with their asset class and successful with it, they are experienced sponsor operators who know how the financing game is played, bring real cash equity from their own seasoned resources and are bankable.<br><br>My feeling us that we could do the mezz piece, turn around and buy out the first lien holder, and controlling the entire deal and capture all the profits.        </p>

          Sal, I am in contact with a group that buys, rehabs and then sells noo homes with tenants, to investors through another arm of their business, with short term, Interest only loans. A lot of them are coming due and they are seeking a private or institutional buyer to purchase an approximate $15 Million tape of Performing Notes as well as $1-2 Million per week of newly originated notes.<br><br>Additionally, they have over $60 Million in short-term notes which they would like to refinance to longer<br>term notes and make available for purchase.<br><br>Is this something that would interest you?        </p>

          Billy: <br><br>I&#39;ve seen this sitcom before and many re-runs of it over the years. <br><br>These guys aren&#39;t really qualified: They use friend’s money to make loans or rehab junker houses. They use SDIRAs. Then they think they’re ready for the big time. But you can’t pee in the tall grass with the big dogs when you’re still a pup in your 50K houses that no-one wants as collateral. <br><br>When they can get around 100K *per house* then maybe we’ll look. But for now, these guys would have to get each of these investors sign that their notes would be subordinated to a new credit facility and these guys aren’t going to do that. <br><br>Walk away. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Just finished the DIP videos.  If debtor does not pay and we foreclose.  Got it.  However, doesn&#39;t it go to auction at that point?  Couldn&#39;t we be outbid and not actually get the property?        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Just got a lead on 143 single family rental portfolio for sale in Florida. Per the information I received, some of the homes are rented and some are vacant that need $5k to $12k in rehab work. Seller is asking $6.5 Mil and will carry back a note with $1 Mil equity. I am requesting the five data points, but I have a question regarding Current Debt. <br><br>When asking for current debt, in what format should I request this information since there are 143 properties?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Suzette<br>        </p>

          Joseph. <br><br>This past winter I did something that I’ve never done and that was to JV with another guru on offering my product in combination with his. <br><br>Lee has a strong Broker Certification Program, and my Hard Money Financier program is second to none as it relates to using your own funds or raising outside capital to lend out and make money on. <br><br>This is something for folks who already have an understanding of residential real estate how you can make money lending out Lee’s money from his fund that I helped him with. <br><br>I added my hard money financier to this because it was a perfect fit for the next level. Like peanut butter and chocolate. <br><br>So it’s a very robust program and many of our Intermediaries get small checks (few hundred to a couple thousand) from Lee for doing these deals. <br><br>And if I didn’t believe in this, I wouldn’t have combined my program into it. <br>If you’re looking to make quick fees brokering money, this is for you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

        <p>
          Can someone answer a simple question.  The services I&#39;m offering regarding providing money for the DIP or the Commercial lending through your program, would I need to get a Money Broker License?  Here in North Dakota in the ND Financial Institutions states that the Money Broker has to be licensed through the  National Mortgage Licensing System and the license is $900.00 AND to be Bonded?  OR is there a way I dont Need a license.  How is everyone else dealing with this??????<br><br>The state statue states:<br>&quot;Money broker&quot; means a person or entity who, in the ordinary course of business,<br>engages in money brokering.<br><br>&quot;Money brokering&quot; means the act of arranging or providing loans or leases as a form<br>of financing, or advertising or soliciting either in print, by letter, in person, or otherwise,<br>the right to find lenders or provide loans or leases for persons or businesses desirous<br>of obtaining funds for any purposes.<br><br>13-04.1-02. Money broker license required.<br>Except as otherwise provided, a person other than a money broker licensed and authorized<br>under this chapter may not engage in money brokering in the state of North Dakota without a<br>money broker license issued by the commissioner. A person engages in money brokering in<br>North Dakota if the borrower resides in North Dakota.<br><br><br>How is everyone else dealing with this??????  <br><br>Thanks        </p>

          Major<br><br>I believe I answered this already. And its not simple, as I&#39;m not an attorney nor am I qualified to render legal advice. I would contact a competent *local* counsel if you have any more questions.  <br><br>To repeat myself here is what I placed on here almost a month ago:<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>Major:<br><br>We&#39;re going to have something this next weekend that will speak to the legal side. I just have finished recording something with our counsel. <br><br>This should clarify this. <br><br>Now, we&#39;re doing this as I am not an attorney, nor am I qualified to render any legal advice. However, in the video I do speak about in the Q&amp;A how we&#39;ve paid intermediaries for deals in the past without having a license. So the content was there, you just chose not to see this or acknowledge this, in my opinion. <br><br>No one else has had an issue with this, if this is not a good enough of an answer, you are free to retain your own legal counsel as this is as far as I am allowed to discuss this, understood? <br><br>I&#39;m here to answer member&#39;s questions about deal sourcing and transactional structuring, generally speaking. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal, <br>I too am obviously not an attorney, however in most states from what I&#39;ve read, unless your arranging residential mortgages, you do not need to be licensed or bonded.<br><br>As Intermediaries, we are not acting in the capacity of a broker. A mortgage Broker in the traditional sense of the title is someone who takes in a loan request, packages the loan for underwriting purposes and submits that package through a internal network of funding sources and waits for a quote and a good faith estimate of costs.<br><br>We are dealing with private institutional monies from one resource, meaning Dandrew, so there is a big difference between what we do and what those who act in the traditional capacity of a Mortgage Broker does.<br><br>I have never had a real estate broker, a commercial client or anyone else in a transaction ask for a brokers license.        </p>

          Sal is my pal. Good day to you. Just wanted to share my experiences so far. I am calling banks as you know but yesterday I got a call from someone who has a 2018 property tape! It was a broker of course. Yahoo address, +3 points, needs to close tomorrow! Anyway- I told him straight up we do not get involved in daisy chains and I need to be direct with seller otherwise I will not get involved. Just wanted to share what is out there with other intermediaries. Felt good to stand my ground and the guy respected me for it. Because of your excellent mentoring it gives me the confidence and intellectual capital to feel good about what I am doing. Feel real fortunate about it all! Thanks again.........        </p>

          Yes. Let him find a buyer for that on Craigslist.org. <br><br>Many of those tapes are old and have already sold. You would be sad and depressed if you followed that one down the rabbit hole. <br><br>Good work! Outstanding professional maturity. I am proud!<br><br>Sal        </p>

          I am getting more information so I am not absolutely sure.  I think they are getting a very good basis and will be scraping the other buildings.  I think they would be open to our suggestions as to what we recommend after hearing the deal and what they plan.         </p>

          Sal, <br>I got the DIP program and scripts over the weekend, and also got the Mezz/Pref package about a week ago. As I mentioned to you, I&#39;m finally taking action. I have Linkedin Leaders and also the credibility kit. Now that I have the tools, I need a plan. I&#39;m trying to sort out how to approach the FDIC lenders, with three possible different solutions. <br>I want to avoid getting scattered. The old cliche says the if you chase two rabbits, you will catch neither. How would you suggest that I proceed? Thank you.<br>Chuck        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I didn&#39;t state that very clearly. What I mean is that there are different scripts for different situations. The original elevator speech, which ends with &#39;do you have any legacy assets that you would like to clear off of our balance sheet&#39; is different from &quot;are you holding an other pieces of capital structure that you want to clear off your balance sheet&quot;, which is also different from the DIP scripts. I just want to ask the right question in a given situation. I suppose it depends largely on where the prospect came from. I&#39;m not averse to just bundling the questions to see if any one solution applies, but if you have any suggestions here, I&#39;m open. Thanks.<br><br>Chuck        </p>

          Hi Bernard and Welcome!<br><br>I would first download the *AskDandrew Owner&#39;s Manual and Quick Start Guide*. Read through that. <br><br>Then start reviewing the Dandrew Commercial Triage video modules. <br><br>Then you&#39;ll have an understanding of how to use your &quot;Pyramid of Priority&quot; to contact banks. <br><br>There is a lot, but we are very committed to your success! <br><br>Sal        </p>

          After watching Sal go thru the debt stack example in the DIP video the bell went off, not just because it reminded me that I&#39;ve seen this before, but because it is so much clearer to me now than the first time around. Sal&#39;s sunshine is beginning to burn the fog away!        </p>

          Just received the marketing stuff from the cred kit and it looks good. Our printer has it and will be printing next week. Then I plan to go out to all the RIA, banks, real estate offices, networking events..... Will start the LinkedIn marketing efforts along with starting the blog posts and creating content/eBooks and such. I have access to great social listening tools that can create and grade opportunities for me as well. Lots of stuff can be done you just got to be hungry and active.<br><br>As a side note, I am also starting to use the cred kit and such to create a list of qualified operators and sponsors as I network with architectural firms, higher end commercial brokers and such.. I am sure it is me, but I am finding more opportunities that need qualified sponsors and operators so I want to have them so I can close deals. <br><br>For example, I have an older gentleman that own apartments and want out but I have nobody to sponsor the deal... I also am planning to go talk to every business and discuss what their exit strategies are in hopes to find a few that want to maybe create a fund to invest in commercial real estate.... But I still have the problem of needing a sponsor for these as well....<br><br>So if anyone has qualified sponsors and operators for the assets DD supports let me know. <br>        </p>

          Dan<br><br>You are definitely doing the right things. <br><br>The sponsors can be found on LinkedIn with some simple, but clever searches. <br><br>I see a lot of need for this type of focus. Perhaps I can do something later for a Continuing Ed. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Did I hear right on the call from yesterday, I just listened to the recording, that a new cred kit is rolling out? Will we just get access to the new one? I just received mine and had it all printed yesterday which is why I was not on the call as I was with the printer.<br><br>Also, I am scheduled for a trip to Houston this week on a business transformation project. Project has stalled once already due to a few issues so we will see.... Part of this will include a raise. I would like to get some help on this. What do you suggest? I have been completely through the PE program and feel comfortable with the process and the requirements. I read, listen and watch everything you make available. I would like some help on the 1st one and then after that I will be fine.<br><br>As a side note, we see many capital projects that are not getting funded in companies due to bank restrictions and companies wanting to stay liquid at this point. Marketing a private capital process to solid businesses with strong influence could be a great way for me to get big projects for our company while creating funds we can mange in the capital side of the house. You THOUGHTS ?????<br><br>Thanx and I love this side of the business...         </p>

          We will be releasing a new credibility kit for the Capital Group, this is the Arbitrager&#39;s Bulk REO answer to the Private Banker kit. <br><br>And regarding businesses, that is not our core business. But later this year I&#39;m expecting to rollout a venture capital business toolkit that looks over my shoulder as I make investments into smaller companies. <br><br>Companies not making money right now may be too dependent upon leverage or have bad management.  <br>Sal        </p>

          Got a hit from the cred kit on a group that has control of a cable operator in tier2/3 cities. They are in the process of converting the cable system to digital and then consolidate the multiple cable providers and sell it off to Comacst. They are looking for $25M to do the conversion and then the exit is estimated around $300M. I have the liars document, proforma, but this type of deal is very common and I think we could get a letter of intent to purchase from a major cable carrier... What do you think? I am talking to the sponsors &amp; operators.         </p>
