          Hi Guys,<br>Similar to &#39;superdeb&#39; my 2 questions are also related to interns.  Until now, I&#39;ve been doing everything myself, with limited success.  The problem is that I do not have the time to do everything and would love to get an intern.  My questions are:<br><br>1) Being based out of Europe, should I wait for Peter&#39;s internship program to launch, before I make that step, or should I do my own thing?  I&#39;ve already interviewed a few people, but I don&#39;t want to make a false move that could cost me a lot in wasted time.  <br><br>2) As I work with other funding sources, will Peter&#39;s program be suitable for non-Dandrew deal flow.  In other words could I use &#39;his&#39; interns for the other deal types I deal with, or should I get my own intern for that side of my business?<br><br>Comments from all are welcomed, Darryl<br>BTW, I&#39;m glad I made the trip out to Vegas - it was worth the lack of sleep and not seeing daylight for 4 days!  I&#39;m looking forward to the videos.        </p>

          Hi Darryl!  Hope you&#39;re well.  Rita and I enjoyed meeting you in Vegas.  On the interns...just my 2 cents worth...Don&#39;t wait for the intern program to launch.  You&#39;ve been well trained and the manual from the Dec event...Sal said to use it to train your interns.  We brought on Rita&#39;s college aged son as our intern and he&#39;s been focused on marketing.  Amazing results.  We provide him with e-mails text to various lenders/sellers and we help him with the responses.  Just bringing him on to do marketing...he&#39;s marketing and learning the basics of deal screening, etc., loves it and for some reason gets much better response rate than we did.  Perhaps it&#39;s his signature block that states &quot;Intern&quot;.... Whatever the reason, it has significantly increased our deal flow.  Still have to find something fundable...but we&#39;re seeing opportunities!  So don&#39;t wait.  You should be able to train them to do different areas of your other businesses as well.  YOU have knowledge...it will be valuable to them to intern with you.   BEST, Dana and Rita!        </p>

          We are currently directly &#39;Networking&#39; with several &quot;Alum&#39;s&quot; - and it seems that for each one we add; it is a multiplication factor instead of a &#39;Plus One&#39; factor.

          There is strenght in numbers. Let&#39;s support each other by sharing ideas and opportunities. There is enough to go around. Dandrew has the same belief, that is why they are getting us involved. I which ALL of us great success. Eni.        </p>

          Absolutely Agree.  And as Sal has taught over and over...get direct...direct to buyers, direct to sellers and direct to lenders that you trust.  Go to your network with deals that do not fit into Dandrew&#39;s wheel house or that they are not interested in.  We always give Dandrew first look ;-)        </p>

          Hey guys I wanted to post something I mentioned in the last conference call, it was about these so called NPN, REO pool brokers. <br><br>My thing is.... KEEP AWAY FROM THEM. Ask me how I know that. <br><br>I have wasted a huge amount of time screwing around with these guys who say they have access to these tapes. The only thing worse than wasting money is time because you can get money back but not time. If I actually tried to get in touch with more banks then I&#39;d have put in a good deal and got paid from Dandrew by now. <br><br>I understand the feeling of wanting to work with these Brokers. They already have a Relationship that you want to establish with banks, so what’s the problem? Well they will most likely ask for way more points than Dandrew wants to pay out for once. <br><br>I’ve talked with enough of these clowns to know how to qualify them quickly. <br><br>1)  Ask them how both of us (you and the broker) are going to get paid? <br>2)  If they say it’s 3 points (which they think is industry standard but way to aggressive) tell them that’s not going to work because at the most you’ll get paid out (correct me if I’m wrong Sal and crew) up to 1.5 points. BUT tell them you’d be more than happy to split the profits with them 50/50 because (to use one of my own lines) you’d rather get 50% of something then 100% of nothing. <br>3)  Extra credit bonus: If they do get irritated since they’re not going to get the big rock star points. Tell them what you can’t do with points you can make up with on volume. <br>4)  A massive WARNING SIGN to these brokers who aren’t serious. They will blow the heck up out of your phone. This is a massive warning sign that they need you WAY MORE than you need them. <br><br><br>Now most will say “Ooga booga booga I’m an investor rock star,” (paraphrased of course) and other stupid crap like that. <br><br>Personally the last clueless guy made himself out to say he met a corportate officer at a big bank through networking. When I was send the contract he send me an “irrevocable master fee agreement,” which screams BULLSH*T. Plus like I said with #4 him and one of his partners were calling 2-3 times a day so that was 6 phone calls to my cell. <br><br>When I did talk to the original guy I told him I couldn’t agree to that since it wasn’t my money, but what I could agree to is splitting my money 50/50. He got upset. I told him, “I’m an investor just like you.” He said, “You’re not an investor like me.” I laughed and thought that I guessed he wasn’t like me because he doesn’t want to get paid. <br><br>There were others I’ve come across who were more relaxed about it. They agreed with my philosophy of 50% of something vs. 100% of nothing. Their deals didn’t look like I could submit to Dandrew without getting yelled at by Sal but still those folks are out there. <br><br>Hope this helps with Dealing with REO and Note Brokers. <br>        </p>

          Matthew, we agree and have learned the hard way as well.  Our intern, has been marketing on LinkedIn and that&#39;s where the brokers hang out.  I&#39;ve wasted so much time on the phone with these brokers when I could have been spending that time getting direct bank contact. I spoke to one that was very nice on the phone and agreeable to not participating in daisy chains and stated he was direct to the seller.  He presented us with an amazing tape of Colorado properties.  When we wanted the buyer to get on the phone with the seller he couldn&#39;t get to the seller and then we found out that most of the good stuff on the tape was gone.  <br><br>I can be quite gullible at times and tend to fall for it but I&#39;m slowly getting better and able to sniff them out. My suggestion is that it&#39;s best to avoid anyone, no matter how nice they sound.  Get direct!  If these people are real, why are they seeking you out?  They shouldn&#39;t have any trouble getting buyers if they&#39;re real.<br><br>Thanks for your warning.  We agree.  Direct is best!<br>Rita        </p>

          Hi Sal and Corey!  Love the ability to interact with other Dandrew Alums while continuing to learn from you guys.  Here&#39;s a question:  As a Dandrew REO student:  Do you see anything wrong with telling the bank that we’re sourcing pools for a hedge fund buyer…or are direct with a hedge fund buyer?   We’re not saying we work for a hedge fund, just that we’re sourcing opportunities for a hedge fund.  <br><br>Thanks in Advance!        </p>

          No. I don&#39;t see a problem with that. But what I would say &quot;hedge funds and other institutional investors of whole loans&quot;.         </p>

          We have a loan opportunity.  They would like us to sign a Commercial Mortgage Brokerage Fee Agreement.  Their fee schedule is in the ranges of between 50bps and 80bps depending on the loan amount.  I&#39;m not completely comfortable signing this so I wanted to run it by you first.  Appreciate your guidance.<br><br>Rita        </p>

          So we never sign upfront fee agreements.  But we’re making an exception in this case.  We&#39;re going to be giving one of our sources .25 of 1% of this deal if we close it.  Our source was brought in to help a troubled bank sell who’s never sold off assets…clear their books of 250MM (in a quiet way… under FDIC pressure, so these assets are not being heavily shopped).  They were brought in by the bank and are bringing assets to us and a few other funds. <br><br>The .25% of 1 point will come out of the consulting fee we collect from the hedge fund buyer.  If we get more than 1 point, their portion is still .25% of 1 point.  Of course, no fee will be paid until/unless we&#39;re paid by the hedge fund buyer we bring to the table.  We would like to know your opinion on how we structure that fee agreement.  Are they paid out of our consulting fee at closing?  Or would it be best to pay them as a contractor after we close.  It seems the latter complicates things and adds more work for us at tax time (?)  Most of the fee agreements we&#39;ve seen stink.   Peter had a conf call with our contact last week and we&#39;re just trying to get this agreement out of the way before all of the DD materials and everything Peter asked for comes in.  <br><br>I&#39;d also like to know if we need to ensure the bank knows their guy will get compensation from us...  Conflict in the bank&#39;s eyes?  Just don&#39;t want any trouble ;-)  <br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>Dana         </p>

          I would suggest that you do NOT guarantee anything unless you have a 1% fee agreement from the buyer. Do you have that yet? Don’t promise anything to one without locking it in from your fee source first (ask Karen Morison about that at the next MasterClass…). <br><br>If you don’t, then don’t sign anything. <br>        </p>

          Thanks much Sal. Working with you guys though, our agreement says TBD<br>and doesn&#39;t commit to a set amount that you will pay us. We have a<br>verbal...of what you&#39;ll pay, which is why we&#39;d never commit to<br>anything over .25 up front.    So we&#39;ll just tell them we can only give them a verbal conditional &quot;agreement&quot; until there&#39;s a formal fee agreement for the deal that includes our 1% fee from the buyer!   Thanks again!         </p>

          Sal,<br><br>We got this question from a HML.   They asked, &quot;We are looking to put some volume on our books, but we would like to have a conduit, such as your group, to sell off portfolios in blocks.  Would you be available to talk to me about my idea of how we could basically originate with the intent to sell you the receivables to free up our lines?&quot;  I&#39;ve had this question from through another HML a month or so back.  Is this something we&#39;re going to be seeing more of?  How do we handle?  Is this something you would be interested in?  <br><br>Thanks,<br>Rita        </p>

          What they are referring to is &quot;Table Funding&quot;. This is something that would work but these notes would have to be sold to us at a *discount*. <br><br>I would strongly suggest that you have them send over a copy of their portfolio (asset level tape) and see if we could get them a credit facility. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          We received a response from a BK attorney in regards to DIP loans.  This is what he asked, &quot;Do you take an assignment of the documents? Or do you refinance the transaction.&quot;  I&#39;m not sure what the answer would be.  I would think refi but am confused.  Please help.  Rita        </p>

          We got this response from a bank when they got our note looking for NPN&#39;s:<br><br>&quot;Regarding buying non-performing notes, we have 4 DebtX notes.  These are the participation interests in 4 separate loans from 4 separate failed banks we purchase from the FDIC at a discount.  I believe prior to doing the 80% loss share arrangement with acquisition banks of the failed banks, FDIC sold off the failed bank’s non-performing loans at a discount.  The DebtX we have are a participation interest in the original participation loan (not the original full note/loan amount).&quot;<br><br>Can you help me understand what this means?  My assumption is that they have a % of interest in a note.  Why would anyone want that?  Also can you better explain the 80% loss share arrangement with acquisition banks of the failed banks part as well?  I researched about this on FDIC.gov but it&#39;s still not real clear in my head how this loss share agreement works.  Maybe that&#39;s something for a continuing education.  <br><br>I appreciate your assistance.<br><br>Rita        </p>

          Technically there is a difference between a 2nd and a Mezz piece. Here is a good definition of a Mezz piece via Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzanine_loan        </p>

          Thanks guys...we did discuss at the masterclass...but I thought that a mezz was secuered by preferred equity in the entity that holds the asset.  It appears that a mezz piece can be unsecured as well.  When we&#39;re seeing the bank tapes, we see 1st and second position liens....Would we see &quot;mezz&quot; on a bank tape?  Or do we assume what we&#39;re seeing on the bank tapes as 2nds are unsecured seconds?          </p>

          Dana: You are wrong! What is happeneing to my MasterClass? Pref Equity and Mezz are 2 different structured products in the captial structure. Like a tire and a hubcap. Similar, but not really. <br><br>Mezz is secured by the assignment of partnership interests in the LLC so in the event of default, the mezz holder can take over the partnership interests (or shares of stock) in the LLC that holds the asset.<br><br>*Be sure to review this page from the Dandrew Triage Capital October Manual.* I put a lot of work into putting that illustration together. <br><br>Lastly, what is on the tape and how it is defined is strictly a function of what the bank wants to put on there. There is no set rule and because I&#39;m cynical at best and paranoid at worst, I would suggest that you ask. Never, never create your own tape because that could cause a lot of problems if we bid on something that we think is a 1st but is really a mezz piece. I don&#39;t want you placed into the crossfire! <br><br>Be sure to review that chart too! OK!?         </p>

          Thanks Sal, I will also review the Mezz section in the October manual.  So back to the original question;I still need one more piece answered.... if I&#39;m marketing to Mezz lenders, do I want (does Sal want) performing or just NON-Performing Mezz pieces?  THANKS!  Sorry I will miss you guys at the Masterclass, but Rita will be there to represent NCP!          </p>

          Good Evening Guys.   We&#39;re seeing a lot of Hotel Note Purchase Requests where the sponsor has the opportunity to buy the note back at a discount.  I know you only do Flagged, 3 Star or better, but I have a few questions.<br>How much fresh equity do you want to see from the sponsor when they want to buy their own note at a discount?  What kind of exit strategies are appealing for Hospitality right now?  There are no government programs to take them out and conventional seems non existent for hospitality right now.    <br>Thanks AGAIN!  Dana        </p>

          Right now, if they were to buy their note back at a discount, they would be in bed with us for a long time. Meaning it could be years. <br><br>With that said, they need to provide to us that it&#39;s flagged and that they can afford the bridge loan rates for a protracted period of time. No *non-flagged hotels!*        </p>

          We had a Hard Money Lender approach us looking for a unique approach.  Below is specifically what they stated:<br>“We are looking for private equity, debt, a combination of the two or a programmatic relationship with a firm that allows us to sell them loans on a flow basis. <br>We would like to generate $40M-$60M but the ideal number would be $100M. So to answer your question a bit further.....<br> #1. A programmatic relationship with an entity who would buy our loans would be great.<br> #2. Our borrowers usually have pre-determined exit strategies but we would be happy to refer our borrowers to other institutions that can help. (The terms of our loans are generally 12-36 months with loan amounts as high $5M)<br> #3. Yes we are looking for capital/private equity and/or debt in the form of a warehouse line of credit. If we had some solid equity capital we could most likely leverage that and increase our yields.”<br><br>We realize that you don’t do warehouse lines of credit but would this be something that you might be interested in?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Rita        </p>
