          Wow. A great use case to share. It didn&#39;t turn out well, but it makes me really want to avoid going down this road.<br><br>In retrospect, what tips would you offer to help us short circuit this kind of phantom hunting? &quot;Trust but verify&quot; everything from the beginning, fine tune our BS meters, expect that this is a cost of doing business, all of the above? <br><br>In my ignorance, it sounds like being more critical up front would save everyone a lot of time. Too much CO2 generated not to close the deal, but I&#39;m not confident that I would have been able to avoid doing exactly what Raphael did.         </p>

          Small ask for the good of the order: would you mind flipping the switch in Kajabi that allows mobile video? The .mp3 audio files work, but absorbing this material with the visuals is a little easier. Several of these recent updates aren&#39;t rendering mobile. Good materials, BTW.         </p>

          I frankly like both, Sal. Thanks for responding.<br><br>When I&#39;m driving or walking, I plug in the audio. When I can sit still or when content includes graphics or white board drawings, I prefer the mobile video option. <br><br>I can watch many of these on my iPhone 5 and iPad. Some of the more recent updates, I suspect, were simply not &quot;switched on.&quot; Common with Kajabi and Kajabi-like portals - sometimes mitigated by a checkbox on the bottom of the new-video-posting SOP.<br><br>On this site, there have been only a handful I couldn&#39;t get to render properly on my mobile devices. It just happens that they were ones I wanted to watch vs listen to.         </p>

          Guy owns a hotel. He mentioned to me last night that he is in process of buying a few gas stations. Yes, I have questions for him.. skills set mismatch, track record, etc. His request is no where near ready for prime time. He opened the door with me to dance, but I had good reason to take a rain check at the time. <br>My question for you is about business that comes with real estate: In this case, gas stations. Do we offer debt? Brokerage? <br>Wearing the Dandrew intermediary hat, should I learn to like these or do I steer clear? Does it &quot;depend on...?&quot; Is it a Flag vs mom and pop (as with hotels) situation?<br>No matter which way you answer, can you briefly help me understand your thought process. I&#39;d like to be able to exercise some judgment rather than ask you each time.         </p>

          David:<br><br>I don&#39;t know anyone who finances gas stations. It can be a major contamination risk - meaning if there are any issues, the EPA can and will go back to Moses on the chain of title and scorch the earth. I&#39;ve seen it happen. <br><br>The hotel: only flagged. With experience. No smaller, mom and pop hotels. The reason has to do with marketing and management. The flags have very elaborate marketing systems that ensure higher occupancy and a policy and procedure to handle everything.

          An enjoyable continuing ed. Thanks guys! Here&#39;s more on Capital Stacks: http://mlccapitalpartners.com/capitalstackvideo.html<br>I posted this elsewhere on Dandrew per Sal&#39;s request, but it may be more appropriate here. <br>I did this for my borrower/clients a few weeks ago. It includes more graphics illustrating many of the same points. I bookmarked the main points so viewers can skip to the diagrams they are most interested in.         </p>

          One of the best discussions I ever read on how to derive cap rate was published by Ray Alcorn on REIclub.com in 2008. When I first read this (in 2008), it became clear to me how different positions in an investment (in the capital stack) will have different risk and return profiles. It helped me to realize that a broker&#39;s usual declaration of cap rate is, as Ray says &quot;...flawed in it&#39;s source.&quot; His approach made sense to me and I&#39;ve referred to it often over the years.<br><br>Ray also provides the math which may take a beginner a few reads to grasp (it did for me), but once understood, should provide a good foundation as part of future analysis. <br><br>Here&#39;s the link: http://www.reiclub.com/articles/deriving-cap-rate         </p>

          This information is useful to me, if for no other reason than to be able to recognize it when I see it. Any continuing ed materials related to this subject allow me to speak more intelligently about the subject of our craft. Sometimes, the simple act of being able to carry on a half-way intelligent conversation gives me the edge. Thanks, guys!        </p>

        <p>
          In the context of &quot;Funding Sources,&quot; I like to think of &quot;strategic investors&quot; as individuals or entities that align their capital with specific outcomes. If their desired outcome is proliferation of green energy, they may be inclined to invest in projects that include a green energy component, for example. If their desired outcome is gentrification of a given sub-market, their investment may be geographically focused - and only provided in the presence of a business plan that furthers gentrification. <br><br>While I don&#39;t think of &quot;strategic investors&quot; as having a specific place in a capital stack, I suppose if the desired outcome is risk averse consistent returns (as may be found in some pension plans and insurance companies), they may be inclined to limit their investment to a defined waterline in the debt stack - say 65% of the value and only provided as a debt instrument. They may never venture into the equity portion under any circumstance. The reverse could also be true where an investor has a allocation specifically for higher risk / higher return. This investor may target common equity or an aggressive preferred equity position. <br><br>A more Dandrew specific example may be an investor who is looking for a bond alternative and opts to set aside an allocation solely for grocery anchored retail in the mid-west. Their strategic outcome may not be to support grocery stores, but to shelter their capital from volatility. <br><br>The important take away, from my perspective, relative to &quot;strategic investors,&quot; is that for better or worse, they are more polarized than their counterparts. They are looking for specificity in an investment that aligns with their desired outcome. If we can deliver that specificity in a project - or on the flip side, if we can find the investor who&#39;s strategy is aligned with a project - we are more likely to close a deal. <br><br>From a marketing perspective it becomes important, therefore, to understand how strategic investors group and move. For example, ESG investors (those who align their investment capital with environmental, social and governance issues) might be found paying attention to business news that highlights advancement in green energy. If we want to serve them, we get ourselves in front of a group of them with our message - maybe by placing an ad in a magazine that caters to them, by giving a talk at a local chamber of commerce, or by following affiliate organizations that focus their efforts in that direction.         </p>

          I know this guy. He&#39;s got a different name when I talk w him, but the pile of stuff he pushes in front of him (and all over everyone in his path) is the same. <br>Some say one can get over the fear of public speaking by imagining the audience in their underwear. I suggest that one can get over the agony of talking with a guy like this by imagining smashing him in the face with a clock.          </p>

          Sal - I wonder if you can share your thoughts on CMBS vs CMBS 2.0. What&#39;s going to be the impact on our community as we encounter more 2.0 (post 2010) loans?         </p>

          My thoughts on this: <br><br>There are 45 CMBS lenders in the market, and the volume is only going to be +/-$125 billion this year off from the 2007 peak of $225 billion. This does not seem like enough product to go around. <br><br>Borrowers are more cognizant of CMBS structures and the lack of ability to modify loans. This is helping non-CMBS lenders increase their volume. *This is great news for Dandrew Intermediaries*. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          From what you&#39;re saying, it seems like CMBS would be a good foil - our product offers flexibility that CMBS doesn&#39;t. You (Mr. Borrower) can go to a CMBS or a CMBS 2.0 product, but you won&#39;t get the ability to modify your loan the way that we can. <br><br>After your comment, I went looking for something that might highlight specifics - things that are not flexible about CMBS - and found this interesting paper. It&#39;s a little dated, but considering the vintage of CMBS itself, it seems relevant to me: http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201105/201105pap.pdf<br>        </p>

          Deal review &amp; opinions welcomed:<br><br>Strike 1: Market is 4th tier: 2012 population estimate 21,161 based on extrapolated info from the 2010 census. <br>Strike 2: Mom and pop retail, not-for-profit day care center. Not anchored by anything. <br>Strike 3: Current FICO 530 - down from 670 as a result of multiple financing requests.<br>Strike 4: Basis is not attractive enough, but I&#39;m thinking if someone were so inclined, it may be more attractive from the bank as an REO<br><br>This deal is probably not attractive enough for the Deal Desk, but I thought it might make for good conversation on AskDandrew - if for no other reason than to see what questions / data points / angles I missed:<br><br>- The loan request is for 6.675 mm. Term desired is 24 months. <br>- Borrower is highly motivated. <br>- Current owner has not paid his payroll taxes and is currently into an 850k tax lien from the IRS that is growing fast.  <br>- He&#39;s three months in default on his debt service payments, is facing foreclosure, and does not want to file BK.<br>- Underlying collateral was appraised in November 2013 for 8.9 mm and consists of 2 buildings, 11.49 acres, with good drive by visibility. <br>- Exit is to stay in the loan for 24 months, fix his credit, then refinance to a conventional loan. <br>- Current NOI is 30k / month or 360k / year. I believe this is also his ProForma NOI. <br>- UPB on existing debt service is unknown. <br>- Debt service payments are about 45k / mo. IRS just hit him with 60k payment and is drawing directly from his bank account.<br>- Owners FICO was 670, but dropped to 530 as a result of many requests for financing. Each time he came close to closing, the IRS added additional money&#39;s due on top of his already large bill, and his closing had to be renegotiated. <br>- Debt stack includes a 1st TD of 5.34mm from &lt;X&gt; Bank. <br>- They&#39;ve tried 8 times to close. Headed to Foreclosure. No legal has been filed. Owner not interested in BK (yet)<br>- Owner has only a single family 280k private home as additional collateral.<br>- The business has been around for 18+ years.  <br><br>The story is simple: The owner ran this daycare center as a not-for-profit business since 1996. His wife contracted Lupus. He got into medical bills and hospital lifestyle and neglected payroll tax for his 130 employees. IRS went after his performing assets, placed a lien against his two buildings (which he owns), and are accruing interest quickly. Owner is drowning. He wants to recapitalize his debt stack, pay off the IRS, and get his business back on track. In two year&#39;s time, he projects he&#39;ll have good credit and be able to refinance into a more conventional loan. <br><br>If I were inclined to do something with this (and I was interested in the collateral), I would explore BK as an option. Barring that, I&#39;d need to be into this deal at a better than 75% LTV basis. He&#39;d either have to come up with more capital or find another lender. In the back of my mind, I&#39;d think: let it foreclose. Approach the bank now with discussion of how we can help them out with OREO. Buy it as part of a bundle on the back end. <br><br>I&#39;ve given my opinion of this deal at the very top. Did I miss something? Are there questions I should have or would have asked? Is there an angle to this deal I am missing.         </p>

          David:<br><br>I think you and I and the rest of the members here know that there really isn’t anything that you can do. <br><br>But, this reminds me of when AJ started with us – as a Student Intermediary – where you want to help, but that is costing you valuable time. <br><br>That is how AJ got the nickname the “Happy Sap”. I understand there is a human element to this and you want to help, but this business is a numbers game: a) the basis you get in at, and b) the number of deals that are submit-able vs. the ones that are coming in. *You have to learn to look at these deals dispassionately*, otherwise you will *fail*. <br><br>Now pragmatically speaking, not just to you *but to all the members here*, I have to be nice to the Dandrew Intermediaries – or as nice as I can be - because that is what you pay me for. I have to provide helpful guidance as that is the value proposition; *to make sure your course of direction is consistently corrected to get to success*.<br><br><br>If you were to submit this to another institution, they would probably look at you as being inexperienced and would ignore you. They are not the IMF and neither are we. <br><br><br>This is when I ask: “Well, Dave. If this was your money, and you had all the funds needed to fund this deal, would you and your wife fund it?” <br><br><br>The #1 reason why people get mocked at in this business is thinking their capital provider’s money is just play money or something that can be thrown away. They don’t put themselves into the shoes of their capital provider. <br><br>They will think “Dave, you know this deal is dogshit. Why are you sending it to me? You don’t respect me so I’m never going to look at anything you send to me again because there are 1000’s of other guys like you who will fling poo at me all day long. You bring nothing but ants to the picnic and you’re not providing any value. Good day.”<br><br><br>Tell me, would you invest your own money in this deal? Or are we going to have to do some conditioning exercises for the first hour or two when I toughen your skin a little during your Day with Sal (and AJ)… <br><br><br>*My response isn’t to you, but to make the rest of the community think like I do. The gut check in this business will never steer you wrong.*<br><br>No one ever got rich trying to turn a turkey into an eagle…<br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          Sal - point noted. I would not (and did not) submit this deal to the deal desk or tie up staff time with it. I agree that it&#39;s out of the box and has too many strikes against it - as I enumerated right up front. <br><br>You have to admit: with new intellectual capital products coming from your office all the time, new ways to slice and dice deals: DIP, BK option, capital formation, bank back doors, sponsor substitutions, etc etc.: it is clearly possible for there to be solutions to problems that we intermediaries miss. <br><br>There is definitely blood in the water on this deal. That is its most endearing quality. I posted this to see if there was any secret Sal sauce that I may not have considered before I close this file tomorrow. <br><br>The truth is that I am indeed inexperienced at some aspects of this business. I make no apology for that. If I weren&#39;t, I probably wouldn&#39;t appreciate Dandrew and all of your info graphics as much as I do.  Maybe I&#39;d be working &quot;at the Goldman Sachs.&quot; Just kidding... That video made me laugh. <br><br>I&#39;ve watched you turn turkey&#39;s into eagles. It&#39;s one of your strengths. Just look at how many turkey intermediaries like me you&#39;ve turned into smart profit centers. Look at how many deals you brought the hammer to and turned messes into millions. <br><br>If I submitted this as anything more than discussion on this member&#39;s board, I would be think myself worthy of harsh criticism. I&#39;m sure you get lots of &quot;play money&quot; attitudes come through the deal desk, but this isn&#39;t a game. In the forum, it&#39;s intellectual exercise for me - sharpening of the proverbial saw. You&#39;ll know when I am serious. <br><br>I appreciate having Sal as a wing man and very responsive sounding board. You have impressed many people  with more angles and tricks than I knew were possible. <br><br>For better or for worse, you&#39;ve given us the freedom (and the forum) to fail safely. It only makes us stronger. <br><br>To be clear: would I risk your capital or mine on this without some good discussion and a solid plan? No way! This was a fail from mom and pop day care to 21,000 population. The personal crisis at home and low likelihood of substituting a suitable owner / operator sealed the no-deal. <br><br>Despite this deal being confirmed as a dog on it&#39;s death bed, I&#39;m frankly pleased that our marketing and credibility systems are set up and working as advertised - and that I&#39;m getting the phone to ring. Next deal...<br><br>Thanks for your feedback. I listen.         </p>

          Took my phone to the gym and listened in on the AskDandrew call today. Sal left just as I was winding down. The question I didn&#39;t ask on the call: <br><br>What&#39;s the big talk around the water cooler for funds managers and property portfolio holders today?<br><br>I&#39;m headed up to New York later this month for the US Real Estate Opportunity &amp; Private Funds Investing Forum. It would be great to be primed with a few of the more relevant and timely discussions that are likely to come up. Any big market color, pain, or sentiment I should brush up on before the trip?        </p>

          Hi Sal, I may something for your active intermediaries. Reputation is everything, and many of intermediaries use LinkedIn to build relationship with bank officials. I can place media citations for people so they will be quoted on CBS, Fox, NBC and ABC. After than they can have these logos on their profile photos on LinkedIn. Instant credibility. This is actually a conversion technique. See how one of my profiles looks like https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikekostin. Just imaging AJ&#39;s photo with and without these logos. Links to citations are also provided.         </p>

          This is done by placing citations/quotes on media syndication sites. I will need to verify one thing before going further.        </p>

          Hi Sal, I had to do this for myself first to test it. First we need a short citation from a person who wants to be quoted as an expert in his field. The citation is posted (takes about two weeks) on affiliate sites of ABC, Fox, CBS and NBC. Although the sites are not the high level sites like fox.com, they are still part of network, therefore it is legit to use the ABC, ... logos. After the citation is published, we will provide the links to the citations in case someone asks (although no one normally does). Will also add media logos to the person photo so he can use it on LinkedIn profile, business cards and so on. The main effort here is to place the citations on the media cites, not the &#39;photoshop&#39; job. In addition to that I can add a press release about this person&#39;s company.         </p>

          Mikhail - this is interesting. I&#39;ve been quoted in the New York Times, CIO Magazine, Computer Government News, and a handful of other publications in Europe and Canada. Are you saying I may be able to post some kind of logo on my Linkedn profile that formally announces the fact that I&#39;ve been quoted for expertise? If so, how would one find out about such a thing?<br><br>I didn&#39;t place any of my quotes deliberately, or pay to have my quotes placed anywhere though. These were published  either by press who were in attendance at a talk I gave - or by press who were trolling some articles I wrote. Not sure if that makes a difference.         </p>

          http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-19/us-economy-dead :: Articles like these get my attention, ruffle my feathers a bit, and leave me wondering: First, about the validity of the argument; Second, about what it means to my community, my family, and myself. The author essentially states that the US economy is dead: no response to stimulus, no response to the drop in oil prices, and an abysmal Black Friday retail performance. <br><br>I see signs of struggle and denial all around. I would not argue against the fact that the US GDP is not the same tangible basket of goods and services it used to be. There is a lot of fluff and filler in there. This &quot;bag of groceries&quot; weighs less in terms of real value, than it did when Americans were growing victory gardens and manufacturing plants pumped out tons of steel in support of the war machine &amp; automobiles. I think an argument that the US economy has devolved has validity, though I&#39;m not ready to call the code just yet. <br><br>When I think about my community, I come up with this: People are doing more with less &amp; they seem generally battered, flinching, and unhappy. I live in an area of the country where unemployment is very low - mostly thanks to government jobs and biotech. But when I talk with my friends and neighbors, their mood is subdued. People don&#39;t feel like their labor is appreciated. They worry about their retirement and entitlements. They commute to work with heads down and seem to me to be stuck in a paradigm that peeked and is sliding into obsolescence. <br><br>When I think about my family, I consider the fact that we made the time to dismantle the old paradigm and forge a new one. As a family that&#39;s made a living working for others, we had a good lifestyle. Better than most, in fact. My wife is a medical provider. I was a high ranking federal employee with 20 years of service behind me and a strong track record of leadership and performance. Together, we were easily in the top 1.5% according to this chart: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluence_in_the_United_States. In part due to the unique nature of my job in the Federal government, we saw writing on the wall in bold letters and believed we had a difficult decision to make: throw our lot in with a dying paradigm, or embrace a new one. <br><br>When I make things personal and focus on myself: I have yet to break even, but I see signs that I was hoping I would see. The decision we made was the right one. I gave up a few years of W2 income (about $500k), paid out a bolus of additional after-tax money (about $150k) for education. In my mind I gave myself the necessary skills to throw judo moves on the economy. Instead of bracing myself for impact, as I would have if I held onto my job (as my neighbors are), I got out of the way. I learned how the financial system works and how I can benefit from it&#39;s movements. I learned how to make money when things are bad and when things are good. I&#39;m getting paid for my knowledge - much of it, I acquired by participating as a member in the Dandrew community. This month, I made about twice as much as I did in any given month when I was working for the Federal Government. <br><br>My security is no longer in the hands of an employer - who is at the mercy of economic ups and downs. My security comes from the fact that I now know, better than most, how things work and how I can add value to people&#39;s lives - no matter what the situation. When things are bad, people need money to make it better. When things are good, people need help protecting their money for the bad times. Everyone needs better yield. There is always opportunity for folks like us. As gravy, we work with an alternative asset class that will always be needed, generates better yield, and offers more security in balance than just about any other asset class. <br><br>The purpose of this post is to celebrate with you - the good news that we are among the few who are on a path that leads us away from trouble and towards prosperity. When our entitlement programs fail, we will be okay. We know how to create value that people are willing to pay for. When the dollar pops and flies around like a balloon with a hole in it, we will be okay. The principles we learned here still apply. We can syndicate chickens and toilet paper if need be. <br><br>I&#39;m feeling pretty good right now - despite the gloomy news we hear rumbling like thunder in the background. I feel like the people I call are (or should be) happy to hear from me. That&#39;s not too shabby.         </p>

          Sorry, Los22. I only just saw this. Sometimes I wish Kajabi would send us email when items get posted in forums we follow. I&#39;m told that can&#39;t happen. <br><br>For background (and reality setting) purposes, I worked the phones first. I made contact with the receptionist and left VM with the numbers she transferred me to, then I followed up. After a couple of follow ups, the receptionist let slip the name of someone whom she thought to be the correct POC: <br><br>&quot;You need to talk with Mr. (First name) X...I&#39;ll connect you.&quot; The receptionist said. I wrote down the name and used it when I called back the next time. <br><br>&quot;Hi, this is Dave Dejewski from MLC Capital Partners for Mr. or Mrs. X&quot;  works better than &quot;Hi, this is Dave Dejewski from MLC Capital Partners. I&#39;d like to speak with your Chief Credit Officer or the Head of your Loan Portfolio.&quot; When you have a name, the gatekeeper is more likely to simply pass you through.<br><br>Once I got a live, decision making body (maybe my third call to that bank netted the Head of the loan dept), I had a friendly conversation and was told that the CEO, Mr. Bigman, made the real decisions about selling loans or OREO. I&#39;d have to speak with him. <br><br>I was also told that Mr. Bigman was busy and I would have to try again later. At which point, I suggested that I might send him a simple email with my contact info. He agreed that would be easier and gave me mr. Bigman&#39;s email. I asked Mr. X if I could use his name when I reached out to Mr. Bigman. Mr. X agreed. <br><br>Here&#39;s the email I sent the CEO, Mr. Bigman:<br><br>&quot;Mr. Bigman,<br><br>My name is Dave Dejewski and I¹m with MLC Capital Partners. (First name) X and<br>I spoke this afternoon and he mentioned that you and I might have something<br>to talk about. <br><br>We are a principal buyer of non-performing notes and REO. We can¹t help you<br>with your new construction and development loans, but we might be able to<br>clear your balance sheet of SFR, Commercial and Multi-family. We might also <br>look at slow pays and non accruals that you pick up in the future.<br><br>It¹s clear that your bank has made some progress reducing these<br>sub-performing assets over the last year or so. I¹m just wondering if we<br>might be able to speed up the process for you.<br><br>I can be reached at 888-502-1267.<br><br>I¹d love to help you finish up the year strong. Of course, that would mean<br>our year would end well also as our interests are aligned.<br><br>Pleas enjoy the rest of this holiday season!<br><br>Dave<br><br>David Dejewski<br>MLC Capital Partners LLC<br>One Research Court, Suite 450<br>Rockville, MD 20850<br>Main: (888) 502-1267<br>Fax: (301) 916-6062<br>Dave@MLCcapitalpartners.com<br>http://MLCcapitalpartners.com<br><br>I got a phone call from Mr. Bigman the next day. He&#39;s only selling on par right now and using realtors, but he&#39;s on simmer, is subscribed to my newsletter, and will get another follow up call from me in the first week in January.         </p>

          Pricing expectations are up as demand and trading volume for NPN has more than doubled over last year. That &quot;76&quot; number quoted in the Bloomberg article you and Dave Gordon posted... How is this affecting the smaller banks that we&#39;re talking with every day? Does this news materially affect our strategy?<br><br>Here&#39;s the article for folks who couldn&#39;t get to the broken link published earlier: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-11/hedge-funds-boost-bad-loan-prices-as-u-s-sales-increase.html        </p>

Although larger pools will get higher prices because of securitization, smaller pools are trading everyday at over 10%-15% higher than they did a year ago.<br><br>Here is more on this from a *separate* Bloomberg article: <br>Sales of U.S. delinquent mortgages are accelerating as lenders rush to meet demand from hedge funds and private-equity firms that has sent prices surging. <br><br>Bank of America Corp. is marketing soured mortgages with a balance of about $3 billion, said David Tobin, principal at loan broker Mission Capital Advisors LLC. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. is offering about $1.3 billion of the debt, according to two people with knowledge of the sale. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. last month sold about $500 million of bad loans to Lone Star Funds, while Oak Hill Advisors LP bought $659 million of delinquent debt from Freddie Mac, said two other people, who asked not to be named because the transactions are private. <br><br>The market for defaulted mortgages is heating up as Wall Street firms try to profit from the housing recovery, banks seek to avoid the added costs of holding delinquent debt, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development sells loans to reduce losses at the financially troubled Federal Housing Administration. A $3.9 billion HUD offer in June was the most competitive to date, drawing more buyers and bids than previous sales and setting off a flurry of auctions last month. <br><br>“It’s three forces conspiring to create a big trade frenzy,” Tobin said. “Sellers looking to sell, lots of buyers looking to buy and pretty good fundamentals, which are making pricing dramatically higher than in 2012.” <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Small Bank A ($140mm - $180mm total assets) shows OREO fluctuating between $16k and $1.6 mm. 51% is in SFR. They just closed a branch. I&#39;ve read their annual report and they&#39;re in trouble. With such a small REO pool, is this bank in the Dandrew box or is this something we should consider too small to need Sal?         </p>

          Good discussion. I am tracking. I took an email from a LinkedIn contact today who is probing our services. I mentioned the three: Capital Placement (Private banking), Arbitrage, and Capital Formation - beings that we are in  in all three Dandrew programs. He mentioned that my Web site doesn&#39;t mention the arbitrage and expressed specific interest in how we could help him with his REO business. <br><br>He may not be a viable client, but I found it a little uncomfortable explaining what we do via email when my Web site isn&#39;t congruent with that aspect of the business yet. I explained the fact that arbitrage is not on our Web site like this: we typically move non-performing balance sheet and REO&#39;s direct with banks. Capital formation is a concierge service for special clients. Then I told him about our typical clients, turned the tables, and asked him to describe his short and long term goals so we can explore how we might be able to help him. <br><br>Working the arbitrage and capital formation services into our private banking Web site - or perhaps serving it up on its own Web site - is something I am considering now. Just makes life easier. I&#39;m pretty sure some Dandrew expertise would help keep our proverbial feet out of our mouths. <br><br>I look forward to seeing how this unfolds.         </p>

          Sal - I am frankly impressed that you&#39;ve managed to cover as much ground as you have via these forums, live classes, video training, audio training, info graphics, conference calls, etc. Technology is a great force multiplier in the right hands. <br><br>At some point, all birds need to leave the nest and fly on their own. I&#39;ve spent more than $100 k on education in the real estate space over the years - many of the programs were quite good. This is by far the best program I&#39;ve experienced for getting people on their feet, cash flow flowing, and independent action under way. Granted, I didn&#39;t come empty handed to your program and my absorption / application rate is certainly influenced by my previous experience, but you are ever present here - heavily leveraged and still responsive. That is exceptional. I, for one, am grateful.         </p>

          It&#39;s challenging to negotiate without first knowing what&#39;s &lt;b&gt;fair and reasonable&lt;/b&gt;. This question is meant to help tease out &quot;fair and reasonable&quot; from a current negotiation I&#39;m having with an Italian Fund Manager. My role here is as Placement Agent. The fund is based in Europe, but they are seeking US investors - very much the same investors I&#39;ve built connections with in the US. This is early stage negotiation - before the engagement letter is executed. <br><br>I sent our usual engagement letter with a $5,000 non-refundable retainer to judge their conviction. They sent me the following. This is quoted from their email. My comments are in &quot;&quot;&quot;bold&quot;&quot;&quot;. <br><br>&quot;In the standard (I suppose) engagement letter that you have sent to me, there is an advanced payment of 5.000 USD that is out of our policy of capital raising.<br><br>Also the entry commission fees of the fund that pay the investor are:<br><br>Until 5 millions euro 2% with retrocession of 1,6% to the placement agent (80%) &lt;b&gt;(Ours reads: &quot;$ &lt;1mm – 5 million     5%”)&lt;/b&gt;<br>Between 5-15 millions euro 1,25% with retrocession of 1% to the placement agent (80%) &lt;b&gt;(Ours reads: &quot;$5--10 million   3%” and: &quot;$10-15 million 2.5%&quot;)&lt;/b&gt;<br>over 15 millions euro 0,75% with retrocession of 0,6% to the placement agent (80%) &lt;b&gt;(Our reads: &quot;$15-20 million 2.0%” and &quot;Over $20 million 1.0%.”)&lt;/b&gt;<br>There are not other entry fees that we can turn to the placement agents. &lt;b&gt;(These fees are less than half of what we would typically ask)&lt;/b&gt;<br><br>With regard to the mezzanine we can pay fees on the basis of the above mentioned commissions ladder alike.<br>As for the costs that you will support, we can only imagine a refund success fees. So before you ask permission to spend to us, we give permission and then when the money will be arrived in the fund will be paid the refund success fees. Also keep in mind that we will have to come to the US to sign and close the contracts, then the operation is expensive also for us.<br><br>These are conditions that could only be improved in our favor since they are standard conditions imposed by rules of the fund in the course of approval with the Luxembourg authorities.<br><br>It&#39;s impossible for me sign worse conditions.&quot;<br><br>My question is: &lt;b&gt;what&#39;s fair and reasonable to negotiate for Placement Agent services?&lt;/b&gt; We could simply go with a take it or leave it approach, but I&#39;m looking for for acceptable range for Placement Agent fees. Maybe a give and take - for example, pay me up front X and I&#39;ll reduce % fees by Y. <br>        </p>

          Why are you driven to do this for a company – non-real estate related in a foreign jurisdiction – for only $5,000 and such low fees? Just answer me that. Do you really want to engage with these guys? I think that you’re doing them a favor and they are chewing your down already on something that may or may not be successful?         </p>

          The upfront fee is a token, really. It&#39;s not where the real money is in this project. I put it in as a negotiation throw away, frankly. <br><br>This is about real estate. I can&#39;t go into a lot of detail in this venue, but they are starting a fund to buy property of a certain type, implement well defined management efficiencies - essentially &quot;flag&quot; the properties, if I were to use the hospitality metaphor, and sell the package to one of several new markets that are springing up as a result of the new legislation. It looks like something we could sell, the management team has a good track record, and the team has a leveragable brand. <br><br>In my reply, I agreed to waive the $5,000 fee and to adjust our engagement letter to reflect the terms they have in writing with Luxembourg. I added, however, that I would be willing to accept the remainder of our usual fee in the form of equity carry - without voting rights - in the project. I suggested that this would ensure our interests were aligned and that we wouldn&#39;t be tempted to put another client&#39;s project before theirs. <br><br>With regard to the expenses, I asked him if he thought it would be fair for us to shoulder the risk that he wouldn&#39;t be able to close. Closing is, after all, the responsibility of the fund manager. If we agreed to shoulder the costs alone, we take the risk of introducing them to new capital all day every day and essentially working for free. <br><br>I explained that he retains the right to refuse any expense he doesn&#39;t feel is worthwhile - we simply won&#39;t pursue that course of action. At the end of the day, we make no profit unless the project closes. Expenses are simply a cost of doing business - his business, not mine. <br>        </p>

          Here&#39;s what I am comfortable with: there are a million ways to make money and create value for people in this business. The majority of the one&#39;s I&#39;ve experienced have been fun to me so far. This is a career choice where creativity, intelligence, and tenacity are rewarded handsomely. What&#39;s not to love? <br>A few years ago, I would not have been comfortable that I could add value to anything like this, Sal. Today, I feel very differently. Today, I wonder why more people aren&#39;t taking advantage of what we know.Today, I crave more complicated problems to solve. It&#39;s great to be puzzled for a little while, but be confident that given a little time, and maybe a little help from friends, that we will figure it out.         </p>

          OK. You win! Great answer. Now commit to getting something done. Another quiver in your cap and money in your pocket. <br><br>You may want to search out smaller investment banks to help with this. Barclays may be interested in this too.         </p>

          Hi Sal,<br><br>Are you interested in seeing any deals that Dave Lindahl is attached to? I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;ve seen an old video, or something, that you know who he is and potentially have access to his deals.<br><br>I have a couple of Multifamily deals with Lindahl attached, that are looking for equity. Their marketing looks to be setup for retail investors and it doesn&#39;t look like they have money..Because of that, I&#39;m inclined to pass on these outright, but wanted to verify the Lindahl thing before going further with them.        </p>

          MRios - I&#39;ve had many years experience with the Lindahl community and Lindahl deals. The problem isn&#39;t that Lindahl deals are &quot;bad.&quot; or that any deal is &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good.&quot; Lindahl-style deals are not ideal for the Dandrew method of financing. Let me try to explain: The Lindahl community does one thing really well. They take individual retail &quot;investors&quot; and teach them how to get into multi-family. I personally purchased more than one multi-family deal using the technique. They teach students to go after Core stabilized product, eliminate as many risk variables as possible, and try to get themselves into position to control cash flowing assets that act like ATM machines - putting money into pockets on monthly. They don&#39;t teach much about financing &amp; stick to regular banks to get the job done. Crude, but effective for beginners. <br><br>Core stabilized product is best financed with lower interest rate traditional bank financing. These are not a good fit for bridge lending or aggressive equity. Lindahl students would pay too much. Dandrew would not be competitive in this space. Why pay 12-15% standard bridge lending rates when someone can get 5-6% loans form a bank?<br><br>The calibre of the typical Lindahl person is &quot;student.&quot; While I know a few who have substantial deal books, most don&#39;t. They might be able to handle simple stabilized &quot;momentum plays&quot; or lipstick-like &quot;value plays,&quot; but getting a complex repositioning done would be a challenge. <br><br>A deal that came through a Dandrew desk requires more experience. Perhaps more importantly, Dandrew capital providers would require more management experience. Lindahl students have a huge obstacle to overcome to get the kind of experience on their teams. <br><br>The Lindahl community deals primarily in retail money (on the equity side) and traditional bank money on the debt side - think mortgage broker. Dandrew community deals have more hair on them, require a more sophisticated investor (both on the debt and equity sides), and look more like strong value add and opportunistic type deals. <br>Lindahl deal can be good for the right investor. Think low risk, low reward, core or core-plus types. <br><br>That said, Dandrew does teach how to be successful at these types of deals if that&#39;s your thing. There are institutional investors out there who like stabilized product - or who have allotments in their portfolios set aside for this type of product. Lindahl students are taught to use banks and doctor / dentists. What if you could find new sources of capital (like an insurance company and/or family office) that needs some stabilized product in their portfolio? Might you be able to bring capital to Lindahl students that behaves more efficiently than traditional bank finance or doctor/dentist money? What if you could start a small fund that invests in stabilized product in the equity space and joined forces with an institution that likes debt in stabilized multi-family product? <br><br>For the occasional Lindahl student that actually has a deal book worth looking at (there are a few, but very few), you might be able to structure a credit facility and take a retainer, a fee, and maybe even parts of the deals they use the credit facility for. Getting a Lindahl student to the closing table faster adds value to that community &amp; you would get paid accordingly. <br><br>Make sense?         </p>

          I&#39;d also say, what sticks out to me that&#39;s undesirable,is that Lindahl is a big guru, so I don&#39;t see him managing the day to day on these deals, which leaves us with the inexperienced and no money sponsor handling business. Not really a situation I want to put my name behind.        </p>

          ABS East in Miami beach was powerful this week. The after parties flowed with alcohol and enthusiasm about the markets and reunions between old friends. That said, as generalists (not traders, big buyers, or big sellers), one of the most difficult questions to answer in a venue like that is &quot;What do you do?&quot; There are so many places to take that question - capital formation, capital advisory, capital placement, brokers, placement agents, intermediaries... It&#39;s almost easier to answer &quot;What don&#39;t you do?&quot; In your opinion, Sal, as one who attends these events and knows our business better than anyone, what are some effective ways to answer this question? We obviously don&#39;t want to give anyone a dissertation. Success is simply defined as a good segway to open discussion and explore options. <br><br>I asked a similar question of Dave on Silver hoping for the trader side of the equation, and as one who knows these people personally.         </p>

          It does sound a lot like that when I read it back to myself. It&#39;s similar. The difference is, so already have many elevator speeches. I don&#39;t feel lacking in those. It&#39;s more of a question of either A. Selecting the right elevator speech or B. Crafting one that allows the person we&#39;re talking with to influence the speech we give.  <br><br>When I call folks: banks, clients, investors from the Prequin database, I generally know in advance what kind of player I&#39;m dealing with. I might approach a capital provider with a capital placement pitch. I might approach an emerging fund manager with a capital introduction pitch. Etc. <br><br>Circulating at a conference like ABS East, the person we approach could be anyone - from a BPO salesman, an equities fund manager, or a family office, to a banker securitizing mortgage pools. To be good at working that room, it would be helpful to have either an opening statement that is broad enough to let them know we know what we&#39;re talkiing about without being specific - or turn the question on them first so we know what we&#39;re dealing with. I&#39;m confident I can talk with just about anyone once I figure out what I&#39;m dealing with. I met all kinds that night in Miami. Just hoping for some wisdom that enables us to quickly ID where in the game the other person is playing. <br><br>Am I making sense?        </p>

          Sal, I lead in with whatever feels right for the situation. Sometimes it was &quot;Hi. I&#39;m David. I see you found the one quiet corner in the room. Mind if I join you?&quot; Which was true. It was loud. After some idle chit chat about whatever, the question came up about what I do. While I&#39;d like to taylor my response to whomever I&#39;m talking with (the basis for my question), I often found myself having to &quot;go first&quot; and tell them &quot;I&#39;m an investment banker.&quot; or &quot;We&#39;re providing capital advisory.&quot; or &quot;We help clients make capital introduction.&quot; or &quot;We provide capital placement for...&quot; <br><br>The one thing that seemed to work in that room was &quot;Commercial Real Estate on the finance side.&quot; as many of the alternative assets in that room were anything but commercial real estate. Of course, that got confusing given the nature of our pre-meeting, which was all about NOO resi trades. <br><br>What I&#39;m looking for here is a quick general summary that allows us to paint a neutral (possibly compelling) picture and turn the tables so I can dig deeper into what THEY do. What one sentence communicates what we do in a way that allows the other party to move on? <br><br>You&#39;re in the same boat. What don&#39;t you do? How would you best answer this question and get out of the way so the other party can talk?         </p>

          My name is Dave Dejewski. I’m a real estate investment banker and our firm principally focuses on capital raising and introduction for qualified sponsors in the commercial space. Our clients are people who have found something interesting to buy but don’t have all of the capital they need, or have a balloon coming due on their current debt. I’m here at this conference to source new product for one of our clients who’s in the midst of a raise and he’s focusing on the resi product. <br><br>Sal’s Note: Next time ask me *before* you go to the conference to script this out for you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I&#39;m starting to realize that the most successful intermediaries( I hope I spelled that right /no spell check ) are the one&#39;s that not only learn the information on this platform but also take it upon themselves to learn how to market for commercial loans,They discard what doesn&#39;t work and focus on the 5 or 6 things that do work and do them day in and day out. If I&#39;m correct, I&#39;ll need tons of leads every month just to find the few diamonds that come my way and also have my 2 interns be able to quickly discard the poop and focus on the good stuff. When I start sending potential deals in I want you guys to say-Jerome sent in a potential deal-stop the presses and lets check this out . Have a wonderful weekend everyone.        </p>

          Jerome - right on. Marketing is key. Without it, nothing happens. I spent a solid year crystalizing enough knowledge to be useful in a wide variety of situations. After that, it has been about figuring out how to get myself into environments where my help is considered valuable AND people are willing and able to pay for it.         </p>

          Facilities: credit, equity, re discount, others? I&#39;m hopeful that you can break down the basic similarities / differences between the various facilities. <br><br>I always thought of these as sort of a line of credit extended from an institutional source. Who are good candidates for these? What&#39;s the best way to introduce them to x facilities? How best are they negotiated?<br><br>I am recommending a rediscount  facility to a client who thought he wanted a fund. He has $5mm deployed into hard money loans and $15mm worth of deal flow. To take advantage of his deal flow, build his deal book, keep his $5mm in play, and help him out his infrastructure in place, I think this is a good way to go. <br><br>It got me thinking that it would be nice to lay out the &quot;facilities&quot; options to clients as alternatives when a fund isn&#39;t an option yet.         </p>

          I did figure this out. The loan constant (K) is the true rate of interest payment made. It takes into account the loan spread and amortization. In other words: <br><br>- a loan that is interest only will have a &quot;true&quot; interest rate equal to the constant. The payment is equal to the interest. <br>- a loan that is amortized is changing (principal reduction over time) as a result of that amortization. The actual rate of interests payment is changing (the rate at which interest is paid is higher) along with it. <br><br>We have to figure out what the real interest rate is as amortization slowly changes the balance of principal and interest as percentages of a payment over time. <br><br>The loan constant (K) something we can calculate on our own. <br><br>The formula is as follows: =PMT(Interest Rate/12, Amortization*12,-1)*12<br><br>Where:<br>PMT = the payment<br>Interest rate = the annual interest rate<br>Amortization = the number of years the loan is to be amortized <br>We use 12 because there are 12 months in a year. <br><br>For example, a loan with a published 8% interest rate would have a loan constant (K) (calculated by Excel) of:<br>=PMT(.08/12,30*12,-1)*12 - or - 8.81%<br><br>If this loan were amortized over 15 years instead of 30, the loan constant would be 11.47%<br>If this were amortized over 3 years instead of 30, the loan constant would be 37.6% - meaning the borrower would be paying back a little more than 1/3 of the interest back in that 3 year period. <br>Amortized over 1 year, the loan constant would be 104.39%<br>If it were dragged out to 50 years, it would be 8.15%<br><br>K will always be higher on an amortized loan than it will be on an interest-only loan. <br><br>        </p>

          Dave,<br><br>For this I would look at current interest rates. Lower interest rates typically means more available debt. However, economic turmoil may cause stricter underwriting, which would make debt less available like we see today. Look at interest rates and overall health of the real estate market. <br><br>Matt        </p>

          A prospect contacted me - originally to tell me he&#39;s recently been qualified by a bank for a $6mm loan as a sponsor. He heard my sponsorship substitution podcast and wanted to know how he could be considered as a sponsor. He tells me he has about $5mm in property under management and $1mm liquid net worth. His experience seems a little weak and I&#39;m not personally overly impressed by $1mm liquid, but he seems eager.. I suggested that I&#39;d put him in my database and send him a newsletter to keep him informed of what&#39;s going on and any opportunities that come up. <br><br>Then he asked about starting his own fund. I suggested we might get him organized first (pitchbook, track record, management bio&#39;s) and see what shakes out. I explained a stepping stone approach to fund management - and that he might consider a credit facility, a rediscount facility or similar if he has the deal flow. <br><br>Then he asked if instead of doing a fund related pitchbook, if I could help him raise some capital around single assets. I said sure and explained that we will still need a pitch book, but a &quot;single asset&quot; pitchbook. He knows that I charge $25k for a fund pitchbook. I&#39;m now wanting to price a single asset pitchbook for him. <br><br>So my question is: How much do I charge for a single asset pitch book? <br><br>I intend to modify the one in &quot;Packaging the Deal&quot; as you suggest. My question is about pricing it fairly in today&#39;s market.         </p>

          *EVERYONE READ THIS. THIS HAS TO DO WITH CONSULTING THAT WE SPOKE OF ON THE LAST ASKDANDREW CALL*.<br><br>Good thinking, Dave.<br><br>I agree. This guy has no idea what he wants. Here’s what I do know (and please correct me if I didn’t profile him correctly): <br><br>- He wants to buy something as he’s seeing asset prices increase. He’s anxious. <br><br>- He is looking for a place to put money. <br><br>- He is going to be someone that you’re going to have to probably place on a consulting basis – after the Pitchbook is finished. <br><br>So here is what you should do:  <br>You can ask him for $5K to do the single asset pitch book where you fill in everything but the last 3 pages. Use a *modified* version of Packaging The Deal for this.  Modified meaning you’ll have to swap out the thesis for private lending to whatever asset he wants to target. Hire a writer *after* he pays you to do that if you want but I’ve seen your work and I don’t think you’ll have to do hire someone. <br><br>*For everyone else, hire someone on Elance using this infographic shortcut: https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=298*  <br><br>Then tell him “when he has a date to the prom”, meaning an asset he wants to buy, to contact you and you’ll walk him through filling in the blanks. The asset, the model, etc. You do this for him and copy and paste it into the book. He will feel a) empowered and in control and b) relieved that you did this for him. <br><br>Tell him this is evergreened, meaning he can use it over and over again to show prospective investors for any deals he has.<br><br>Don’t be shocked if he calls you to do this as you’re his virtual CIO. He’ll probably not want to do this but will pay you a hourly rate to do this. Ask me how I know this. <br><br>* Now where you will add real value: You&#39;ll have a moral obligation to tell him if these deals he&#39;s bringing you are dogshit or not using the 5 Data Points. Be frank. Just say &quot;this is a dogshit deal, here&#39;s why...&quot; Like you were me answering question on AskDandrew. He will respect that. And probably pay you $1,000 to review one deal to do so. If he doesn&#39;t respect it, we&#39;ll, you got your 5K and when he blows up, he&#39;ll come back to you.&quot;<br><br>Real estate, like any other investment has an emotional side to him. When you are working with him, pretend you are in the military again and look at the numbers *dispassionately*. He&#39;ll thank you for it and you won&#39;t be able to shake him lose. Again, ask me how I know this. <br><br>Of course, if you need help with this, just post your question here and I&#39;ll set it straight. <br><br>Rinse, wash, repeat. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          General comment: Pitchbook clients frequently ask me for contact information for other fund managers I&#39;ve helped. I don&#39;t think this is an unreasonable question, but I&#39;m not sure I would give them a list - even if I had a long one to give them (which I don&#39;t at this point). My response today (to a new pitchbook client): <br><br>&quot;I won’t be sending you contact info for fund managers. 1. we have NDA’s in place to protect both them and us. 2. Privacy of my clients is not something I am authorized to, or comfortable giving up. 3. Any one of our fund managers might be involved in providing capital for your emerging effort – whatever that shapes up to be. I am completely fine if you don’t want to work with us under those conditions. &quot;<br><br>Am I skirting the question? Yes and no. It is true that I have an NDA with my current pitchbook client, that he&#39;s not interested in my violating his privacy, and that fund managers I know (like Sal) might in fact, end up becoming capital providers. Why would I or any other person in the business of introducing capital, give up their capital sources before any agreement has been signed or we even know if the guy asking is legit? <br><br>Just thinking out loud here. Sanity check welcome.         </p>

          Dave<br><br>You are correct. <br><br>3. These are repeat clients and value privacy. No different than that of a law firm or any other family office. If I were to provide to you their information, they may think that I’m also sharing confidential and other sensitive information too, and that would definitely spook them. <br><br>*[BONUS Gamesmanship Play: Then put them on ice for a week, go radio silent. They will know you’re serious/not desperate and you will be able to get their business faster. If they asked, tell them you got pulled away on a roadshow for another client or something like that.

          No question today, just a comment. I&#39;ve been with the Dandrew community for almost a year now. April will mark one year from my first &quot;Day with Sal.&quot; I spent more than $25k with this organization. I&#39;ve earned the right to talk about it from a paying intermediary&#39;s perspective. Here is my thought as I write this:<br><br>Thank You. <br><br>&quot;Thank you&quot; to Sal, AJ, Tracy, Dave, Peter, Cory, and all the other mysterious and important people who make this program possible. I understand, first hand, the effort that goes into creating video, infographics, audio, a Web hosting platform, security, etc. I know the economics and the politics of a platform like the one the Dandrew crew built. Sure, it makes money, but: <br><br>1. There are days when it seems like all the money in the world isn&#39;t worth the pain and aggravation that comes from always feeding hungry minds and needy entrepreneurs. <br>2. Each failure is like a punch in the gut and the successes always seem too few. <br>3. There are infinite ways we can decide to provide a service. We can chose to be reluctant. That includes being grumpy, inaccessible, condescending, irritable, etc. OR, we can chose to be engaging and abundant: generous, proactive, helpful, etc. This team choses to be the latter.<br><br>- They are prolific - which tells me that they are thinking about us even during plane trips and over morning coffee. <br>They create new things constantly! ...each product with a focus on making our community stronger. <br>- They are accessible - which, while it can be rewarding, is a HUGE energy suck. They are out numbered X,000 to 1, but I don&#39;t see accessibility backing down. Questions posted to this forum are (and have been in my experience) always answered in a timely way and with authority. Help desk staffs always respond. <br>- They are creative. How many ways have they presented for us to look at the material we need to know? Inside the capital stack, along the timeline, outside the property at the market, across the county in heat maps... etc etc. There is a graphic for just about everything!<br>- They are persistent. Despite pressures from others; lack of time; lost opportunity costs; suffering fools, thieves, and abusers (remember the POF letter disaster?), and even lawsuits to take those abusers down a few pegs - they keep showing up. I&#39;d bet my next engagement letter fee that they&#39;ve thought of closing the doors on this program more than one time.<br><br>Things are not perfect in the Dandrew world, but this team is real, they are present, and from my perspective, seem to be truly focused on our success. For that, I am grateful. I&#39;m smarter and better equipped today to serve my own community as a result of my relationships with the Dandrew (and alumni) team. <br><br>Enough sap from me. Time to get back to work...        </p>

          @ David. That was a well written viewpoint about Dandrew and YES- I am real grateful as well to have found them and Sal. The knowledge is great and allows all of us to increase our chances in this wacky world of commercical real estate! Bless you David and appreciate you and all other intermediaries who post on here. May our paths cross soon enough...... Richard        </p>

          David<br>This is easier said than done. This would demand a finder’s fee or an equity kicker if you find a qualified, experienced “New Sponsor”. <br><br>The New Sponsor is the new owner/operator, so he gets all of the spoils that the “Old Sponsor” left on the table. <br><br>We’ve not done a sponsorship substitution since our old OFREE Fund were we had to legally get the investors to vote the old operator out and replace with us or our designated operator. <br><br>Depending on the number of retail investors you have, *and how the docs read* (meaning Operating Agreement), the investors need a 51% vote to oust the Old Sponsor. <br><br>If there is institutional money, they just file a UCC foreclosure, etc. to get rid of the sponsorship. <br><br>So the question is, what do your investors look like going into this deal? I could write a whole continuing ed on this alone. <br><br>Now tell Sal if this is one of your deals you&#39;ve invested in or one you&#39;re arranging for us? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          It&#39;s a deal that came to me through marketing channels. The sponsors are not strong enough. They heard my &quot;Sponsorship Substitution&quot; podcast, found a deal, and are considering the option.  <br><br>Dandrew&#39;s role would likely be to provide debt finance. Maybe help with finding a suitable Sponsor if my network can&#39;t produce one. Dandrew would never do this with the current cast of characters. <br><br>I still have some heavy lifting to do before this deal is ready for Dandrew, but I think the question will come up again.         </p>

          You can certainly find your own using LinkedIn and making a few calls. Of course, you’re a coaching student (or whatever we call you, Placement Agent level) so I can ring my rolodex. But the deal and the numbers have to be tight first. <br><br>That’s where you need to do a little brain damage with the 5 data points and see if this is a real deal or just an “opportunity”. <br>        </p>

Looking forward to a prosperous 2015 and I owe a lot to Sal as being a great teacher and mentor to me and I am sure many others on here as well.

          I finally asked a bag of groceries question! Bugger. <br>My take away: There is no answer to this question. Each deal is unique. So, feel free to send a deal that has 75% debt and needs an additional 10%-15% equity...         </p>

          Dave: <br><br>Good find.

What will they learn?<br><br>(Note: there are folks who like to post articles and other links on here. That&#39;s fine, but the proper etiquette for doing so is to put a comment as to *why* this link may be of value to the reader.

          Sal - My take away is that we are in the right place. <br><br>All forms of money will at &lt;strong&gt;least &lt;/strong? be concerned with this sort of activity. At &lt;strong&gt;most, &lt;/strong&gt;run from it. Where will it run? If we&#39;re in the business of establishing funds, raising or placing capital in an imperfect market, using a clearly defined and well bounded vehicle, then we are in position to provide a safe haven to money that&#39;s concerned about, or running from, nonsense like this. <br><br>I would incorporate a reference to this in my dialog with funding sources and use it in conversation to point out that the grass is in many ways greener on our side of the fence. It also demonstrates that we are sensitive to what&#39;s going on in the industry. <br><br>This highlights the latest of many nails in the Wall Street coffin. <br><br>Sorry for not reading your email. I&#39;ve had to prepare for an important meeting in Vegas. Those guys can be brutal.         </p>

          Very general follow up to hopefully help &quot;Eric&quot; (and others) from today&#39;s call re: the PLN. There was some back and forth between AJ and Eric without a concrete resolution, and I think the problem Eric was trying to solve simply wasn&#39;t clear to all parties. I&#39;m going to attempt to ask the question that Eric asked here in a little different way. <br><br>A PLN page comes as part of every intermediary credibility kit. There are also three unique forms that come as part of our Web sites: 1. a Request a Commercial Loan form  2. an Investor Questionnaire form and 3. a general Contact Us form. <br><br>Use and purpose of Contact Us and Request a Commercial Loan should be pretty clear to everyone. The first is a general catch all &amp; keeps our individual emails from getting SPAMMED. The second helps potential clients requesting a commercial loan (in the Private Banker vertical) to get specific about what they are asking for and collect the data we need. <br><br>The third, the Investor Questionnaire form, seems to target &quot;Individual Investors&quot; as described on the PLN page:<br><br>From the PLN page: &quot;Private Lender&#39;s Network™ (PLN) consists of Individual Investors, IRA&#39;s, Trusts, Pension Plans, LLC&#39;s, Corporations, etc.&quot; <br><br>The PLN page talks about return to lenders (debt), when interest is paid, terms of the loans (periods of no liquidity), tax treatment, etc. It makes the PLN concept attractive to someone (Mom and Pops) who might have some money on the sidelines to invest. One may conclude that the &quot;Investor Questionnaire&quot; is out there to invite individual investors - people who want to offer up their capital or self directed IRA funds to the PLN - to request more information as to how they might put up some of their money to be used to capitalize loans made by an intermediary entity. <br><br>Take a look at my page as an example: http://MLCcapitalpartners.com. Anyone familiar with the old rules around Reg D syndications might consider the &quot;Investor Questionnaire&quot; similar to the form we use to establish pre-existing relationships. <br><br>I think Eric was trying to clarify the relationship between the PLN program and the Investor Questionnaire - and to determine the intended use for the Investor Questionnaire form. <br><br>Eric - please correct any misunderstanding I may have about your question.         </p>

          My Dear Jeraldine, <br><br>You’re the 5th intermediary in the past month who has time on a radio show. How come I don’t get asked to be on a radio show? Is it because of my salty language sometimes? Now I’m sad. <br><br>*Frankly, this is a tall order.* But I’m answering these for you because I’m hoping you’ll be able to get a copy of you on the show talking about these points so the rest of the Dandrew Nation can cheer you on. Deal?<br><br>1. A history of real estate investing’s part in lifting our nation out of recessions.<br>Frankly, I could write a doctoral dissertation on this subject alone. However, follow my drift below in “Bold*:<br><br>*Housing has always been a wealth creator for Americans throughout the history of this country have been able help our nation in several different ways. Primarily, investors have been the mechanism for creating an efficient market when the housing markets have traditionally have been inefficient. They provide pricing discovery at the time they invest and resell to owner occupants who may not ordinarily qualify for traditional funding. Real estate investors think outside of the box to provide meaningful solutions to a majority of the population. This allows the average American to create wealth meaningfully.*<br><br>2. How RE investors can benefit the average American.<br>*Real estate investors benefit the average American by allowing them to get into opportunities for home ownership that frankly isn’t available to a majority of the population today. Banks and lenders are only lending to the top 10% of the population who have strong credit. Unfortunately, this leave most of the working class boxed out. <br>Real estate investors can also help get those homeowners who may be upside down out of their situations by doing the necessary negotiations with that homeowner’s lender. Investors are liquid, have readily available access to capital and this is one of the ways in which investors make markets efficient for both the buyer and the seller. It’s the ability to meaningfully craft the solution and do the necessary heavy lifting that benefits both buyers and sellers.*<br><br>3. Bridge loans and their part in today’s economy.<br>*Private capital today creates the mechanism for transactions to move. It’s the lubrication in the market that allows a buyer and seller to come together to create a market. When there is no access to capital, this is what causes housing prices to go down. <br>Bridge capital has its place as it allows investors to access capital for deals and opportunities that can’t be financed via traditional methods such as banks. This is why private investors are so important to the overall real estate market.*<br><br>Let me know if this helps and send us the recording as soon as you can get your hands on it. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Not a hypothetical here. I&#39;m hoping for some clarity around the concepts of &quot;light,&quot; &quot;medium,&quot; and &quot;major&quot; when it comes to renovations and repositioning of multi-family. For example, I would certainly consider $500 / door renovation &quot;light,&quot; but $6k per door of 50% of the units would not be &quot;light.&quot; <br>What rules of thumb might we apply to these concepts to ensure that we (and our clients) are communicating in a way that is consistent with expectations of our capital providers? Is there already an infographic that covers this?        </p>

          Financial Models: When it comes time to create financial models for our pitchbook clients, what specifically do you recommend that we model? Clearly ,representative or recent investment opportunities lend themselves to modeling. How about the proposed waterfall? What else should we model via excel? <br><br>I&#39;m referring to excel models now. Drawings are a different subject in my mind.         </p>

          Makes sense to me. I&#39;m not sweating yet. Just being proactive. I&#39;ve been paid (I know you&#39;d ask), but my client is moving r e a l l y slowly in getting me his deal book and other materials. So, I&#39;m using the time to improve my situation in anticipation of what I know is coming. <br><br>Specifically, I&#39;m setting up Prequin, making contacts, identifying my modeling team, and creating a series of training Webinars that break down each section of the pitch book, compliance, terms and definitions, etc. it&#39;s all infrastructure that I can reuse for future clients. And I&#39;m having fun doing it. <br><br>If, for example, I have access to two dozen models as a result of my Placement Agent level affiliation with the Dandrew community, I would want to march each of those models out into Webinars and explain the purpose, advantages, and use cases for each. I will serve those Webinars up in my membership portal for those who have paid me. Clients can review them as often as they need to while building their pitch books. Saves me time, multiplies the number of clients I can serve and the number of simultaneous activities I can do, and systematizes my services. Make sense? I seriously love this aspect of the business.<br><br>As for the models for this client, I suspect he will need to demo his hard money lending biz before and after we juice it with institutional capital. I&#39;m helping him with things like: making sure he has a complete file, origination, underwriting, understanding the relationship between his portfolio level metrics vs his asset level metrics, compliance, reporting, etc. Before his road show, he&#39;ll need to show how the money flows, represent how his structure works, etc. <br><br>I&#39;d love to line up those two dozen models as if they were on a buffet and explain the use case for each. We&#39;d have to chose (I&#39;d chose) which one (s) work best for each client situation, then walk that client through the use case for whichever model makes the most sense. <br><br>Have I mentioned how valuable it is for my business to be an active member of this community? Looking forward to Vegas next month.        </p>

          Dave, <br><br>This makes great sense. <br><br>I’d be hard pressed to think one of your clients across any sub-asset play (bulk NPN – simple stabilized NNN and in between) would need a model that is too much different than what you already have access to. If they do, figure out what you need to show, then take one that is most appropriate and hire someone on Elance (use the guy I use) to make those necessary tweaks. Don’t try to do this yourself, it’s the equivalent of giving yourself a root canal. <br><br>There is an old joke on Wall Street that there is only one pitchbook and its been reused for every deal. You don’t need to reinvent everything, sometimes a few tweaks is really all that is necessary. <br><br>Heck, Roger Nelson got $10,000 for reusing/re-purposing the pitchbook in Hard Money Financier for a guy looking to raise money for his private lending pool. <br><br>And regarding everything else, my book that you can get for *free* at www.makingtheyield.com discusses all of the governance stuff. That will come after the road show. But it is important for him to have that laid out somewhere in the back of his mind. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, I own and have read your book(s) more than one time. A lot of my content is modeled after what you lay out in your books - and a few other good books I&#39;ve read - a few of which I&#39;ve paid more than $600 for. Your material is extremely helpful!<br><br>Augmenting the book stuff with what I&#39;m picking up through conversation I have with you, other fund managers and other intermediaries. There is no question that my being part of this community is creating value for my clients. <br><br>Thanks for the way you and the gang at Dandrew consistently deliver.        </p>

          What are your thoughts on fundraising for other companies, Sal? Pros/cons of raising a single blind pool and placing capital as needed from that pool - or treating each client separately and Either a.) doing asset level raises or b.) raising a pool for the client to control? <br><br>Three out of the four prospects I&#39;m talking with now are only ready for golf and cigar.         </p>

          Great question. <br><br>Blind Pools really don&#39;t get funded. They only exist in old Swiss Private Banks, and the larger privately managed family offices. <br><br>Also, what people who desire to do this fail to realize is that it is *prohibitively expensive* for these deals to get papered (PPMs, Subscription Agreements, etc.) .<br><br>Pragmatically speaking, the problem is that the (smart) money will want to know where these funds are being placed, and if someone doesn&#39;t have a rich pedigree or track record, no one will want to invest. I&#39;ve seen some of these from the distressed side and they all have crap in there that the managers overpaid for. <br><br>Start them out on an individual asset basis first. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Each LP has it&#39;s own culture, approach protocols, regulatory controls and ESG requirements. Is it a good idea to reach out and become familiar with these in advance of attempting to guide a Sponsor into that world? <br><br>Might we reach out and establish relationships with some LP&#39;s in the context of a Placement Agent who is, and will continue to be, advising clients on how to capitalize funds of their own?         </p>

          You get more cerebral questions because 1. You&#39;re on a short of people who can capably go there. 2. Your thoughts are usually interesting and thoughtful - albiet sprinkled with sarcasm and cinicism 3. I&#39;m not playing around. It&#39;s not difficult to pick up the phone and read scripts, you&#39;re right - and that leads to quick money. But it&#39;s another matter to distinguish oneself from the crowd of fast action cowboys that my would-be clients run into very day. <br><br>Very simply: if I&#39;m providing advice to client / would-be fund managers, I want to have done the work to be capable of advising them properly. That includes, among other things, making connections ahead of time with would-be funding sources, getting to know their axe, and warming up relationships so we we come knocking down the road with a sponsor in tow, the experience is more productive for all of us.  74 words.<br><br>In this question, I&#39;m seeking your counsel on making the approach to serious LP&#39;s, as I know enough to know that these organizations can be overwhelmed with fund managers looking to close, and can be particular about with whom and how they communicate.         </p>

          Sal - A potential client is exploring his options to collateralize future loans mentioned that he is willing to provide a surety bond or a &quot;bank guarantee.&quot; I wonder if you can explain the &quot;surety bond,&quot; whether the use of a surety bond is good or bad in the Dandrew world, and how we intermediaries might best respond when this concept is brought up in conversation. <br><br>Context &amp; back story: Prospect is a former real estate commercial broker / property manager type. He came to me through my Web site. He&#39;s done a good number of deals in various capacities up to about 400 unit property size, but his recency of experience is weak. He retired once, but is looking to get back into the game and portfolio some property. He wants certainty of execution. He wants speed. He wants to be competitive. He&#39;s reaching out a little early to get some ideas and establish his strategy. <br><br>To accomplish his goals, he&#39;s looking for a banker who can help him with either a fund (he&#39;s not ready yet), a credit line, or the ability to come to the table with capital quickly. He&#39;s looking at markets in GA and FL: Atlanta, Jacksonville, etc. Multi-family. <br><br>He has no deals now. His deal book will be 10 yrs old. He seems to know the game and is willing to take second chair to someone with a more recent deal book and a strong sponsorship position until he gets re-established.<br><br>I want to try him out with a couple of deals to see what he brings to the table. In the mean time, I want to know if I can use this &quot;surety bond&quot; concept he offered as a way to strengthen our position in the deals he brings forward.         </p>

          Dave: <br><br>First, I apologize for not going to your site yet. It’s on my list. With EOM (end of month), we’re working through the weekends getting deals done. And we’ll probably be working through Memorial Day if I don’t manage my time well. <br><br>What you have here is a hero from the past credit boom. 10 years ago anyone could get a loan and overbid on assets. Even brokers. And they all dropped. Sounds like he was taken out after the credit boom as – perhaps – being a weak operator. Remember, to be cynical at best…<br><br>*Brokers are not operators, both technically and pragmatically.*<br><br>Right now, he has no deals and no leadership. He needs to get someone with more experience working with him. <br><br>The markets he’s looking in are *extremely competitive*, especially for multi-family. <br><br>Surety Bonds are not really applicable here as they are more for a developer to complete a job, not manage multiple investments. <br><br>Regardless, the bank or insurance company who would underwrite this would require your borrower to pledge some collateral, some net worth or something. <br><br>*Here’s What Sal’s Would Do:* Do not spend any time with him until he can pay you your consulting fee for you to do a deck. *He has to prove he has conviction in his pursuit before you waste any time with him.*<br><br>In the meantime, I’m sure he’s being nice and learning hard off of you. But you need to focus on stronger sponsors with legitimate deal flow. Not a tire kicker here. There are simply too many opportunities to spend time with this guy who is schooling himself off of you. (Ask me how I know this. Hell, even AJ has hung the phone up on some folks. He’s not as sappy as he once was.) <br><br>You’re not a mortgage broker. You’re an investment banker. Period. <br><br>Sal&#39;s Rule: *If you deliver value, CHARGE for value.*<br><br>My lead in to him would be “look, you don’t have a lot of recent experience, perhaps sales experience in up markets when trees were thought to be growing to the sky and lending was loose, however, I have a lot of projects on my plate now and if you want to structure this out, I can do this, but I need a) this fee and, b) your career deal sheet. Send me the deal sheet first before the money and I’ll see if it even merits taking your money. If it does, I need your conviction in the story that you can do this.” <br><br>This way, you’re getting experience in the following ways: <br><br>1.  Confidence saying “no” to marginal deals.<br>2.  Qualifying your Sponsor. <br>3.  Gamesmanship.<br>4.  Closing the person on the deal.<br>5.  Understanding your “true” value and how much your time is worth (especially after spending a day with me!)<br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          General Comment: AJ&#39;s pitch - very informative and reenforces the material we&#39;ve learned through Dandrew Media and by watching Sal&#39;s pitch a few months ago. Stellar content.         </p>

          This book is nothing less than a cultural primer. It explains a lot. I&#39;m glad you pointed it out. <br><br>Climbing into the mindset of an investment banker means not only a better understanding of the job and the people doing it, but a better understanding of the cultural expectations imposed on those who do the job by those who have worked with investment bankers of this ilk. <br><br>What I pull from this is the ability to differentiate my company from the competition, to more intelligently navigate the banking system waters, and to empathize with the poor sons of a gun who allowed themselves to be chewed up by this thresher to earn their stripes.         </p>

          One of my new capital providers mentions &quot;Taft-Hartley and Family Offices&quot; in the context of their products and clients. They also mention &quot;Commingled funds-of-funds,&quot;  &quot;Tailored separate accounts,&quot; and &quot; Select direct investments&quot; in the context of their strategies. Could you translate these concepts and put them in relevant terms to what we might be doing when we offer our services to potential clients.         </p>

          It starts with making contact with potential funding sources. We chat about what they do and explore one another&#39;s Web sites. This fellow is in the AG space and typically deploys capital in $5-10mm chunks for value-added and opportunistic agricultural property investments. They&#39;ve pooled money into funds - which they deploy into qualifying investments. Nothing hot right now in terms of deal flow, but like you&#39;e said, we can&#39;t control WHAT comes through the door, only how much. I figure something will eventually show up that I can package up for his fund. Our discussion is ongoing as the relationship develops. <br><br>He mentioned these concepts during our talk about the clients his company serves, the products they produce, the strategies they like to use, etc. I jotted them down because I don&#39;t feel like I fully understand what he was communicating to me. I figure I would improve my intelligence a little before engaging him again.         </p>

          He said they are working on something they can share. He first told me he didn&#39;t have anything - that his Web site told the story. It doesn&#39;t. Perhaps I can help him with that. <br><br>I follow up with him bi-weekly. I&#39;ll ask him for whatever he&#39;s got during our next call.         </p>

          David, <br><br>Naturally, he who holds the gold makes the rules. So the more money an investor is coming to the table with, the more rights they want. At least in the institutional world. <br><br>In the retail (aka Ma&#39;-n-Pa&#39; investors), they are not sophisticated enough to know they have rights (as you painfully told me during your Day With Sal when you said &quot;they are Common Equity but act like Pref Equity...&quot; - a quote my industry friends got a big kick out of...), so you don&#39;t have to give up as much to these folks. <br><br>Is this unethical? No. Because an institutional investor has deeper pockets and expertise to help invest *alongside you* to ensure the deal is a success (or sue you to the stone age if things go wrong). <br><br>Retail investors, on the other hand, generally speaking are needy, have no experience and giving them rights would mess up a deal like you wouldn&#39;t believe. They will want a say on everything and you&#39;ll spend more time dealing with the guy who put in $25,000 and expects red carpet service than actually doing the job your investors expect you to do: make money. <br><br>I can tell you I&#39;ve seen and raised money around triage funds (ie: OFREEFund.com) to buy assets from struggling funds where the Indians were running the reservation, and not the Chiefs. <br><br>*Sal&#39;s Rule: &quot;An empty container makes the loudest noise.&quot;*  <br><br>In the Oasis fund, we would buy assets from investors who would say they were big investors, then I would look at their Attestation of Investor Accreditation and see that they a) made 60K a year, and b) lied about their net worth to get into the deal. <br><br>Sal would then tell the investor this in a way that only he can, and then force a capital call on said noisy container investor, or he would be diluted or flushed out completely for false information. Then magically, the investors - all of a sudden - get very quiet? Hmm. Wonder what caused that to happen...<br><br>Just some real life examples. So unless you&#39;re working with an institutional investor who demands it, never voluntarily offer investors rights. They are all passive. Have a Coke and a smile. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Good graphic distributed today on Structuring Sound Governance of Funds! It generated a few questions I can&#39;t answer yet: <br>- what is a &quot;key man&quot; event as referenced in the &lt;Key Persons&gt; block? <br>- in the &lt;Investment Committee&gt; block there is a reference to a &quot;non-executive officer.&quot; What is meant by a non-executive officer?         </p>

          1. *&quot;Key Man&quot;*<br>Here&#39;s an example of *&quot;key man&quot;*. I&#39;m the &quot;key man&quot; in Dandrew Media. If I get hit by a bus, the business may cease to exist in its highest and best operations. <br><br>That means no more infographics that people love, no more continuing eds, no more writing scripts, or having to repeat myself on why the POFs aren&#39;t being issued now &lt;sigh&gt;. <br><br>So any investors in Dandrew Media, if there were any, would want me to get &quot;key man&quot; insurance to cover for the potential loss in revenue to the business and protect their investment in my business. <br><br>The business would probably go on as AJ would take over. But I&#39;m the guy who makes the rain and the insurance would cover the bridge until people warmed up to AJ. <br><br>2. *Non-Executive Officer, Non-Executive Director (&quot;NED or NXD&quot;)*<br>These are independent directors who are not internal directors, sit on boards of different companies. they can still hold shares in a company that they advise on and for start ups, equity is given instead of cash compensation. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Only one question on the Infographic from just David? I&#39;m sad now.         </p>

          Is there an option available to Equiteer and/or Arbitragers to juice up our Web site with Capital Formation and/or Arbitrage content? <br><br>I&#39;ve been thinking about the benefits of making my Web site speak more directly to capital formation and possibly arbitrage. I am assuming here that my target markets will find my site when checking my background. The folks at INET don&#39;t have content to stand up pages for these services - or to tack them onto the Web site that comes with our credibility kit.         </p>

          Suzette: <br><br>Yes. Although it sounds ominous, it&#39;s really a program where you come into the office and spend 10 hours with us going over something really specific. <br><br>We don&#39;t really market it - hence the really bland name. However, its for folks who want to really focus on starting a fund or a syndication - going from 0-60 in 10 hours, or starting a trading desk. <br><br>Its by request only. Call Matt at 866-325-2336 or send a line into DandrewHelpDesk.com if you want to learn more. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Here&#39;s the question you asked me to tee up form the conference call. It&#39;s a bit of a deep dive into the relationship between the Promote, the Manager, and the Capital Partner: <br><br>A. As I am coming to understand this ecosystem, the Promote and the Manager roles seem to be combined in some instances and separate in others. If I understand this correctly, when are each of these options generally used? What makes one structure preferable to the other? Practically speaking, I want to be responsive to each of my potential client&#39;s situations. I was asked who will manage the fund once we get it set up. As I dig into the material, it appears there are options. <br><br>B. What document options (assuming it&#39;s not all one-size-fits-all) do we have to paper each side (Promote to Manager/Operator, Promote to Capital Partner) of that relationship? When do we paper each side? <br><br>C. Can you describe the fee structures (how each role gets paid)?<br>        </p>

        <p>
          Sal,<br><br>I&#39;m seeking some clarification of roles relative to capital formation. <br><br>A. Are We (intermediaries) positioning ourselves to act essentially as consultants to a Client who expresses an interest in a fund? It seems to make sense in this case to take a fee from the Client, use the Private Banking Client Questionnaire Workbook to get the Client into shape, and structure the fund for them (with appropriate legal assistance). The &quot;Private Banking Client Questionnaire Workbook&quot; suggests to me a type of a consulting relationship. I find myself looking for an engagement letter in which the Client agrees to compensate me for that work  - above and beyond the fee structure found in the document mentioned in B below. Should We assume the fee structure We get for finding &quot;Acceptable investors&quot; covers our time and expense doing this consulting up front? <br><br>B. Are We positioning ourselves to Promote a given fund (pitch book initially) and do our best to get it funded? The &quot;Engagement Letter Brokerage Agreement Intermediaries&quot; document indicates an Agency relationship between the Client and my company where I essentially track down &quot;Acceptable Investors&quot; and earn fee for bringing in funds. <br><br>C. Are We taking on the role of the Fund Manager on behalf of the Client - perhaps relying on that Client for deal flow / individual asset management / deployment of capital? Do We keep management responsibilities for the fund after it is established alone or in partnership with the Client? <br><br>D. Any or all of the above given the circumstance? Or dealers choice? <br><br>In a B circumstance, it would seem Dandrew could fill the role of &quot;Acceptable Investor&quot; and We might need to deconflict, or at the very least, disclose our allegiance with Dandrew given the Agency with our Client. <br><br>Thank you for helping me understand this better.         </p>

          Dave: I&#39;ve answered these in same sequence of lettering (thanks for being organized!)<br><br>a. Yes. That is what the Private Equiteer shows you what to do. You are simply doing a raise for other operators. <br><br>b. Yes. Although those services can be stripped apart and be separate from just putting together the pitchbook. <br><br>c. *No.* Unless you want to start your own fund. Ask me this on the call for further clarification but this is either church or state; meaning, you’re doing investment banking work (for fees and retainer) or your doing the same work for yourself where *you* are the operator with the discretion to invest those funds. <br><br>d. Certainly. Disclose that but never until the last moment when the term sheet is given. Before then is not smart.         </p>

          That helps a lot. Thank you. <br><br>Frankly, I didn&#39;t consider doing the pre-fund consulting work for a potential fund holder as a separate paid service until I realized that the number of operators who express an interest in a fund is much bigger than the number of  those I think would survive the scrutiny and competition. Getting these operators into shape takes time. If we&#39;re spending that kind if energy, we should be compensated. A fee might also help to weed out some of the time wasters as well. <br><br>Do you have an agreement for this kind of consulting work somewhere in this course that I haven&#39;t found yet? I&#39;m working through the course and the briefcase, but working w potential clients at the same time. I don&#39;t mind helping them, but the value I am creating for these operators - whether we get them into a fund or not - should be worth something.         </p>

          We do. Its in there somewhere. Its called the *Engagement Letter and Brokerage Agreement*.<br><br>To be certain Dave, *you will never take on an assignment without a fee.* No if&#39;s, and&#39;s, or but&#39;s. It could be the best deal in the world, but if they don&#39;t have the money, you&#39;re better off finding an experienced, qualified sponsor to work with. There are many great opportunities that are lost on broke and inexperienced, weak, wanna-be fund managers or operators.  <br><br>If you want to take the Rolex off their wrist, that&#39;s fine. *But if they have nothing of value at stake, they will not have their interests aligned with yours.* <br><br>This is true in any business. We recently cancelled our $1 trial offer because the people who purchased we found out never watched any of the videos. They had nothing at stake, no skin in the game. Nothing. And when it came time for their $97 to be charged, they had no money either... So our marketing company cut that off after they showed empirical evidence to corroborate this. <br><br>The fee is also going to qualify these people. Some folks you&#39;ll see are all hat, not cattle. <br><br>Ask other Intermediaries what their experiences have been. Roger Nelson comes to mind as he&#39;s doing this a lot.         </p>

          Yes. Ask them to do it, but to call Sal first. Call Sindi about this so they don&#39;t mess it up and I go berserk again like after I saw how your briefcase was delivered. They will probably charge you a fee, but that is well worth it. <br><br>Sal<br><br>        </p>

          Hi Sermonvil: <br><br>We don&#39;t fund individual residential properties. Only commercial, and you must have an *experienced* operator/owner ready to take it down. <br><br>With that said, are you looking to buy a property and raise money around that?

          Well done. I will look forward to it. <br><br>In the meantime, do you have a logo? If not, get one made on Fiverr.com and *BE SURE TO GET THE .AI OR .PSD SOURCE FILE.*<br><br>They will charge you an extra $5 &quot;gig&quot; for this, but you will need it forever. Even if you don&#39;t use photoshop or adobe illustrator. Too many Intermediaries have cried because they didn&#39;t have the source files and their logo looked pixelated, cheap and chintzy, and stretched because they tried to save $5. <br><br>Don&#39;t make your first impression with these folks who are paying you 10 large look like Chris Farley in Tommy Boy...<br><br>Sal<br><br>        </p>

          Yes. I had a logo done a few weeks ago as you describe above. It DID come out pixelated - which I was unaware of until the INET folks got it into print shape. Fortunately, my Fiverr contact is a responsible person. About 10 hrs later, I had a print ready (300dpi) version and the source.         </p>

          Focusing for one moment on PLN - can you give the short answer on how that program conforms to SEC rules regarding solicitation of accredited or non-accredited Mom and Pop investors? I&#39;m not up to speed on how Web pages like the PLN page couple with a 506 (c) or § 201(a). I suspect the new rules make pages like this possible, but I&#39;m sure we still have some back office process to consider to ensure &quot;reasonable steps&quot; have been made to verify investor status? Do you have an easy recommendation?         </p>

          1. What is the average cost, all in, for setting up a fund to acquire a well defined asset class? What is the breakdown of expenses, and what&#39;s the split between my client and myself?<br><br>2. What kind of help is available from Dandrew to get one of these set up?         </p>

          Sounds like you need to go back into the Champagne Room for a private session. Call Matt on Monday and see if he can set something up for you. 866-325-2336. <br><br>My calendar is booking up with roadshows in Feb so call Monday.         </p>

          I agree. I have not had the time to go through all the course work before jumping in front of these people. People have responded much more favorably than I thought they would. Now, from midnight to 2AM is my time to absorb as much as I can. I&#39;ll call on Monday. <br><br>Just back back from the bar for some &quot;after-activities conferencing.&quot; Soon-to-be client clapped me on the back on the way out and said &quot;Dave, send me whatever you need me to fill out and I&#39;ll get it done for you.&quot; <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll send it next week.&quot; I said. <br><br>You are probably laughing, but you can guess how much I&#39;d like to know what I just got myself into.         </p>

          David. <br><br>I commend you for taking action. <br><br>This is really impressive. I&#39;m going to go out on a limb and say your ex-Armed Forces? <br><br>There are two types of people that I know will always get into trouble like this. The good trouble. They are all either a) women, and b) ex Armed Forces professionals.<br><br>AJ had nothing to lose and look at where he is today. I like that. He just didn’t care and took action. Now he’s rubbing elbows with some this nation’s richest folks. The .001%...<br><br>(I&#39;m not politically correct as I&#39;m not being paid by my members to be so.)<br><br>What you need to do is the following sequence: <br><br>1.  Tell your guys you’re aggregating the deal flow from the weekend and determining what is the best fit for your services. This will buy you some time. <br><br>2.  Speak with Matt to come to LV. This isn’t cheap, but you’ll probably use your retainer fee from these guys to pay for this. <br><br>3.  *You need depth.* You’re not going to be able to keep most of your first retainer by the time I’m done and Elance fee is paid, but the confidence you get afterwards being an advisor and investment banker to these guys will pay huge dividends throughout the rest of the year for you. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal - you are right about my military background. <br>I&#39;ll get retainers out to these folks when I get back from this trip (leaving for the airport in minutes).<br>I&#39;m not concerned about keeping my first retainer fee. I understand where I am. <br>Just please don&#39;t kill the goose before it&#39;s laid any eggs. I&#39;m not just talking about fees. I have no securities license or any other form of paperwork beyond this course telling the world that I am legally allowed to do what I&#39;m doing. I want my business above board and legit. I&#39;ll do what I have to to make that happen, but during this &quot;get started&quot; phase, I&#39;m relying pretty heavily on you to keep me out of trouble.         </p>

          Strong multi-family owner/operator with a good team. Interested in buying more multi-family, hotels and other commercial deals. Good candidate for setting up a fund for them? <br><br>If so, how tightly do we need to scope the focus? Do I need special license or other credential? Do I just run the workbook with them, then contact the Dandrew deal desk? <br><br>Hope these aren&#39;t repeat questions. I&#39;m working this from a hotel room in order, have not gotten to that section yet, and can&#39;t control which opportunities people throw my way. The demand for our services seems to be significant.         </p>

          I need help. <br><br>Flew into Orlando on Thursday. I decided to take the Dandrew method for a test run. I expected to meet maybe a few strong operators with deal flow who either need to know more about our commercial lending program or might raise their hand and want to learn more about setting up a fund to buy commercial property. I thought it might be a good stretching / warm up exercise. I used the Dandrew method, shared what I&#39;ve learned so far, educated a bit, and wrapped everything with my credibility kit, auto responders, and personal experience. <br><br>I found strong deal flow, a handful of strong operators, and a demand for setting up funds. The dinner I just left was private with an operator who&#39;s in process of an IPO. He is organized, says he&#39;s ready, and is the guy the other 8 and 9 figure operators turn to. I have been introduced up and around as if they were waiting for me. Private meeting after private meeting. <br><br>A total of three firms are asking for capital formation services - specifically for me to set up a fund that they have varying degrees of discretion over, that they can use to buy specific types of real assets. It seems to be a popular idea among this crowd. I met a third one from the same social circle who is meeting with his attorneys this week to get his fund laid out. <br><br>So far, I am rebranding the capital formation workbook, throwing questions like chaff, and trying to manage expectations - with the hope that I get out of here in one piece and can regroup when I get home. The biggest fish in this school was impressed b the idea of selling from the deck vs selling from the PPM. The PPM in his hand cost him $80k. <br><br>There is opportunity here. I need a wing man. A fumble here would be a mistake &amp; possibly the end of this intermediary - a sad story about a bald guy who took on the Green Bay Packers by himself and got pummeled. <br><br>Birth by fire, Sal. It is bloody hot right now, but I am plowing forward and having fun. Remind me later to never test this stuff over a weekend.         </p>

          Lets do a call this week. I didn&#39;t mean to scare you but when you take action like you did, things happen. <br><br>send an email to deals@dandrewpartners.com and we&#39;ll get something scheduled. <br><br>PPMs are *not* a sales document. No investors read those docs. It a big mistake. Just because someone spends 80K on a PPM doesn&#39;t mean the investors will come. <br><br>You don&#39;t by a prom dress if you don&#39;t have a date to the dance...         </p>

          Sal - This is a really smart and motivated guy. Mentioning that there might be a better way - to sell from the deck vs trying to sell from the PPM - added instant credibility to our exchange. He knew he was taking away an idea that will save him money down the road. I think that by itself paid for our dinner together. <br><br>One question I seem to get a lot is whether or not we can take investor money into escrow before the PPM is signed. They want control of funds as early as possible, but aren&#39;t sure what specifically constitutes a &quot;sale.&quot; When we &quot;sell from the deck,&quot; is a sale = a verbal commitment, a written commitment, movement of actual funds into escrow? It would seem to me that people want written rules and guard rails around their money before they would be willing to move it, but I don&#39;t know the actual answer. <br><br>&quot;Once we have them lined up and begging to get in,&quot; I said, &quot;that&#39;s when we paper the deal.&quot; Yeah. I thought I sounded pretty cool too. They usually smiled.         </p>

          What are the issues we need to consider when a client wishes to mix tax advantaged retail money with institutional capital in a fund structure? <br><br>Some thoughts that come to mind when my client asked me this question: <br>- Will this reduce the pool of institutional investors that want to work with this fund?<br>- Will this require additional verbiage in the docs <br>- Should the fund manager ensure a &quot;cushion&quot; for retail tax advantaged investors to ensure they don&#39;t get diluted in the case of a capital call? <br>- What might the fund manager need to consider when it comes to documenting, reporting, etc tax advantaged retail capital?         </p>

          My simple answer to this is “church and state”. <br><br>You’ll have (and we’re doing this with JG Mellon) two classes of investors. One will be institutional, the other will be retail. <br><br>That is it. Two separate classes of shares. <br><br>However, at this point, if the institutional investment is large enough, do you need the retail investors? <br><br>*Most importantly, what is this fund doing I need more meat to chew on. What will the proceeds raise be used towards?*<br><br>Sal        </p>

          26 days ago seems like a long time ago. We&#39;ve covered a lot of ground in Miami this month. But if this came from one of my current clients, then it&#39;s either going to be used for buying stabilized multi-family or making hard money loans. <br><br>The idea of structuring two separate classes of shares makes sense. It doesn&#39;t tell me what protections or disclosures to put in place, but it does give a good idea how we might structure the risk away from our institutional investors. I presume a well formulated question to a syndication attorney might answer some of this, but I wouldn&#39;t expect them to tell me what rules of thumb to apply to wrap a safety net around retail tax-advantaged investors. Maybe requiring them to have .5x the amount invested in reserve? Or 1.5x the contributed amount? <br><br>You see where I&#39;m going with this, yes?         </p>

          *Retail Investors*: Why do you feel the need to put 50% of that raised in reserves? I don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re doing. These investors take the assumption of risk. You&#39;re coddling them way more than you need to and will hurt their returns ultimately.         </p>

          I can agree with that if we work from the assumption that retail investors are sophisticated enough to protect themselves. What about those clients who don&#39;t make that assumption and decide to insulate their funds against the aggravation of diluting their retail contributions and raising capital to take its place?         </p>

          108 minute phone call w latest client today. These guys have paid me $5K for an asset level pitch deck, but climbing into their business model exposed the fact that they have limited experience and have a huge learning curve to get them into shape. I&#39;m thinking they are a good candidate for a monthly retainer-type relationship. They need vocabulary, discipline, structure, deal analysis, capital raising, etc. The works. They are coachable &amp; seem to be taking advice seriously. There is just no way that I&#39;d be introducing them to serious capital providers until they get a few things handled. <br><br>What do you think is a reasonable $ value and deliverable schedule to offer them? Considering the time I&#39;m investing, I think it fair that I be compensated. <br>        </p>

          Simply doing a single asset pitch deck for these guys. It&#39;s amazing what we learn when doing a simple pitch deck project for someone. Digging in, I discovered their strategy was flawed and their documents suggest that they don&#39;t really know what they want to be when they grow up. I really like this group of individuals. They&#39;ve taken steps towards infrastructure and discipline that sets them above the regular retail crowd, but wow do I see a lot of opportunities for improvement! There is no question in my mind that sharing what I know would help these guys. I just want the exchange to be fair.         </p>

          That will be more than fair. You need to charge them more so you don’t feel irritated talking to them and you’re happy to be taking their calls. You’re schooling them hard. <br><br>And they have no chance to be successful if you’re not there orchestrating the band to hum successfully together. <br><br>Didn’t you just see the Consulting Webinar we just did? Just kidding. I know you did.         </p>

          One idea for an infographic: Lay out the typical income structure for an operator next to that of a fund manager on a page. <br><br>An operator is going to be thinking in terms of an acquisition fee, cash flow and equity splits at the asset level. Typically in very simple terms such as a straight 75/25 split. Whereas a fund manager is going to be thinking about both the asset AND the portfolio level and will include items like management fee, performance hurdles and incentives, etc. I find myself explaining this concept to clients who are attempting to evolve past the purely operator mentality. <br><br>Whether they want to be a fund manager themselves or simply want to interface with capital that is accustomed to working with fund managers, it would be helpful to familiarize our clients with the primary differences. <br><br>Check out this excerpt I got direct from a client this morning. It represents a paradigm some operators have when working with institutional capital: <br><br>&quot;The source of money for an individual purchase is just as important as the property selected. Institutional money however, does come with some strings attached. Many of the income streams that &lt;company&gt; depends on for its own survival are controlled or eliminated when using institutional money. Many times the acquisition fee is reduced or eliminated altogether. Their take of the income can also be great too, leaving little for the investors, and in some cases, their control can also be limiting preventing many of the changes we intend to make.<br>If they were to withdraw their interest after our earnest money has gone hard, this could be disastrous to our financial ability to attempt to purchase our next project.&quot;<br><br>In 75 minutes, I will be attempting to explain the fact that using institutional money provides different income opportunities. It doesn&#39;t mean death or cutting into profit. It can mean additional volume, more robust infrastructure, additional eyes on the market, a safety net, and some additional fees to pay for maturities in infrastructure. <br>        </p>

          I&#39;m not sure this would be a great fit for an infographic. Its smarter money and the terms are all different. <br><br>This guy likes the &quot;loosey-goosey&quot; retail money. Meaning it is generally unsophisticated and he can do what he pleases without answering to anyone. That means there&#39;s not smarter eyes on his project. <br><br>And I get that, but if he wants to build a leverageable brand for himself with the certainty of deeper pockets for other projects and be the next big time developer, he will have to entertain some insitutional money. <br><br>But here&#39;s what he&#39;s forgetting: *He can always downshift back into retail capital* later.  Meaning, he can leverage his experience with institutional back into the retail world again (like I&#39;m doing with JG Mellon...). <br><br>Sal         </p>

          That makes sense. That&#39;s valuable perspective I&#39;ll be incorporating into my dialog going forward. Thank you. <br>I&#39;d still like to see some examples of those smarter money terms so at the least I can demonstrate what is possible. <br><br>That said, while I&#39;ve clearly found a way to monetize a few unsophisticated pages in my Rolodex, I&#39;m starting to consider the sophisticated ones more carefully. Helping to move retail focused operators into the institutional space is fun, but it&#39;s also heavy lifting and those I am helping don&#39;t always have the financial strength to pay.         </p>

          Sal - do you have any clean examples of redemption plans that might be considered acceptable in the market today? <br>Client proposing a 1 year lock up with, will first pay off all obligations, then is then basically kicking them out of the fund - never to return - for asking for a redemption. Seems both simplistic and punitive to me.         </p>

          I&#39;m getting them ready for the show. There are a number of issues that I don&#39;t think they have a healthy paradigm for. Redemptions is one of them. Their opening position was &quot;We&#39;re not giving anyone their money back until we&#39;re done.&quot; My advice was to craft a provision and be ready in case redemption becomes reality. <br><br>Their amended position is that they will lock up capital for one year with no exceptions, then wind down expenses. I&#39;m nudging towards the idea of adopting a first come first served approach - one that allows them to find replacement capital and carry on without derailing anything, but provides best effort to their investors. I&#39;m hopeful that you might have something in writing that can serve as an example or two of redemption provisions in action. <br><br>I recognize that their attorney will craft the final actual provision. I&#39;m simply adjusting attitudes here.         </p>

          There are two sides to this. And this is an important point. Your client’s (fund manager’s) job is to deliver value to his investors. Morning, day and night. He doesn’t want to have to take his eye off the ball to deal with redemptions. No one does. The way to do this is to put a 2 year gate into that. <br><br>Remember, if these LP interests are sold in the secondary market, they will not get par pricing (meaning dollar invested). Sharks like me will pay probably less than 50% for those shares. So he needs to make sure his investors know that their investment – like in any other partnership – is *illiquid*.        </p>

          Several months back you wrote to me on this forum in reference to a client &quot;He can transfer these defaulted or slow-performing notes onto a “hospital facility” but that is a story for the conference in May. OK?&quot; I don&#39;t recall discussion in May about a &quot;hospital facility&quot; or any other facility you and I have kicked around. You were working on a continuing ed at the time as well. Just raising the question again as it&#39;s still relevant and I know you&#39;re busy &amp; may have inadvertently stepped over this one.         </p>

          Its been a very busy summer. Just this past week I was in California pitching and then nose surgery on Wednesday. <br><br>Does your client have anything that requires a hospital facility? Its really moving bad loans onto a new, more expensive credit line so it doesn&#39;t violate the covenants of the first line of credit. If there are bad loans made on that line, that may prohibit the lender from making any additional loans until those scratched and dented have been cleared from that line. <br><br>Enter in the hospital facility at higher terms. And I can assure you that Dave Gordon will be discussing this at his workshop in September. <br><br>Does this make sense? If you need a hospital facility, get in contact with Gordon. As an Expert Network member, you can access him easily.         </p>

          Perfect explanation. Thank you. <br><br>I don&#39;t need one. I was scrubbing through AskDandrew looking for an answer to another question and realized we never closed the loop. I was looking forward to the facility discussion in May. <br><br>I will offer  - if it works for you and you can provide the content (or access to someone who knows this stuff) - to craft a table that shows the various facilities, general guidelines, and descriptions for each type of facility. For example:<br><br>A Credit facility is... it&#39;s used for... structure... terms rule of thumb... sources... special considerations<br>A Rediscount facility is... It&#39;s used for...structure... terms rule of thumb... sources... special considerations<br>A Hospital facility is... It&#39;s used for... structure... terms rule of thumb... sources... special considerations<br><br>Probably a good tool for the consultant toolbox. You can distribute to your other students who are working at that level. <br><br>I did this private video early in the year as an explanation of rediscount facilities for my client after our last talk: http://rch.evsuite.com/how-a-rediscount-facility-works/  It&#39;s raw, but it wasn&#39;t meant for public consumption.         </p>

          Put in what the 10 year Treasury is trading at. *Just enter the the Base Rate*, not the Spread as that is a function of the Base Rate and is driven off of the Base Rate.         </p>

          Using the 10 yr treasury rate makes this work easy. Thanks!<br>Is it safe to assume that each capital provider and/or traditional bank will calculate spread as a function of proprietary internal formulas, or is this something we can do on our own using rules of thumb and knowledge of given market conditions? <br>I&#39;ve been backing out spread by simply subtracting the base rate.         </p>

          &quot;Significant Equity Play&quot; is a concept that needs more specificity. A given investment needs to move the needle some number of points in a positive direction before an institutional investor will consider it &quot;significant.&quot; Recognizing that this concept is relative and that different investors will define &quot;significant&quot; in different ways, what do you think a good rule of thumb and measure might be? <br><br>Some examples might be: <br>- a 1% change in cap rate from a 5cap to a 4cap. <br>- A R.O.E. of 15% in 4 months. <br><br>Can you help me put some specificity around this concept? <br>        </p>

          I&#39;d like to get a list together of expected (lowest common denominator) data points / reports that institutional investors expect to see from fund managers and in what time frame. For example, I assume fund managers will report fund level IRR and perhaps asset level IRR on some regular basis. <br><br>What else will they report? What are the reports and what is the expected time frame for each? <br><br>Should fund managers use a data room service for this? One of my clients is building his own information system to report to his investors. He&#39;s asking me for what data fields / reports should be included.         </p>

          This particular fellow has been dissatisfied with the stock systems he&#39;s experienced out there. Says his business model isn&#39;t unique, but he wants to cover more of his process with automation. He&#39;s paying someone to developer his IT. I think it&#39;s influence from his son, who is an IT guy. I think he wants his son to be a part of his succession plan. May be some family politics. <br><br>That said, any idea where I might find standards for reporting to LP&#39;s?        </p>

          At the risk of crossing replies with you, I tracked down some reporting / compliance resources that the Dandrew community might find useful - in case we ever find ourselves being asked about reporting and compliance in the future. These are three of my favorites:<br><br>ILPA Standardized Reporting Templates: http://bit.ly/1S7krFq<br>NCREIF Reporting Standards Volume I: http://bit.ly/1B8xbaa<br>NCREIF Reporting Standards Volume II: http://bit.ly/1KYU8Nx<br><br>I sent these three to my client and instructed him to coordinate with his accountant to determine which of these standards are most appropriate for the business model he&#39;s trying to establish.         </p>

          I was going to say INREV as well. Good work and thanks for sharing. <br><br>However, this is not what he paid you for, correct? We like to use EisnerAmper for our funds, however, something this small a regular K-1 accountant can do the work for them. Again, if he has 3 investors, this is overkill and probably trying to make his son feel relevant. <br><br>It is very uncanny though that mostly software developers, IT guy and gals all decide to be come hard money lenders... <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal - this opens an interesting line of thought for me. These clients are paying me for two things: 1. to craft a pitch book and 2. to introduce them to capital. The challenge is that I can&#39;t (or don&#39;t want to) introduce them to strong capital providers unless they are strong themselves. I don&#39;t want to earn a reputation as introducing neophytes that can&#39;t play the game. So, I see the holes and try to fill them. I want their foundation strong and their pitch book to reflect that. Handing a client a super pitch book when I know there is nothing behind it, then sending them into meetings seems destructive. <br><br>How do you propose we handle these situations when we find them?         </p>

          Comment from a new customer: &quot;Do you have an example of a tear sheet and pitch book that we could pattern ours after?&quot; <br><br>I told them I would not even try to raise capital for them unless they had a tear sheet and pitch book. <br><br>He has a stabilized single asset in need of renovation with a $9MM loan from Arbor that needs $5MM in equity.

          Tell him you do after the check clears. <br><br>Use the consulting agreement and engagement letter and show him the model. The pitchbook shouldn&#39;t be given away for free. They will struggle with the model and then come to you for help out of frustration.         </p>

          FYI: I didn&#39;t need to send them the model. They just called and will be cutting me a check for a single asset pitch book ASAP. I explained that whether they are successful with this raise or not, they will have an evergreen fundraising tool for their tool box. <br><br>This project is to syndicate $5MM of equity for a $14MM stabilized (91% occupied) C+ multi-family project in a C+ neighborhood in North Charleston, SC (the good section West of 26). This could be played as a Core or a Core-Plus, but they are playing it as a value-add / opportunistic deal. Their concept needs more investigation. <br><br>As is:<br>- $14MM purchase price under contract at a 5 cap<br>- Current NOI: $738,000<br>- Proforma NOI: $940,000<br>- Arbor brought them the deal and will be in first position for $9.1MM (65% LTV). The sponsor has a few hundred K into the deal in the form of deposits, etc (minimal / weak). They want to use the money for acquisition and renovation. <br><br>Their strategy depends on three things: 1. organic rent increases (weak play, but they are 2% below the area in occupancy and $40-$175 below monthly rental rates for the area) 2. upgrading 50% of the units (increasing rent) and 3. recent local government commitment to opening a new entrance to the airport, the Panama Canal expansion (a source for ship traffic up the Ashley river), and a 2.3% employment growth in the city since 2011. Their strategy is to renovate 139 of the 280 (50%) of the units and increase the rent by $125 / month on these units. It remains to be seen if they can do this, but they claim there are two key members on their management team who have proven track records with this kind of repositioning. I am collecting their deal book and management bios &amp; intend to probe deeper. I have not heard them mention carrying costs for the downed units while under construction, for example. <br><br>My cynicism has me focused on their key events, their management team, and the wisdom of trying to reposition a C+ multi-family in a C+ neighborhood. It might be in an area along a newly defined path of progress - in which case, it might work, but we have some homework to do. I am told their team has a lengthy deal book that proves the concept has been executed by this team in other geographies in the past. <br><br>In any case, I will get a single asset pitch book fee and they get an evergreen fund raising tool for their tool box. <br>Good trade.         </p>

          I doubt he understands promote, which is one reason I&#39;m fishing for your thoughts on how to respond to him. His current investors enjoy (interest on their contribution + points) - his fee which is typically 2% for each loan he makes. <br><br>I&#39;m planning to suggest that he take 1.5% of commitments and carry on a whole fund basis, a 20 after a 9 with a 2% fund manager contribution (to maintain alignment of interest) and 0 transaction fees. Assuming $15MM fund and .7% fund formation costs. <br><br>I suspect I&#39;ll be doing some training on fund level performance vs asset level performance.         </p>

          Yes. I agree that is the appropriate way to do this as equity. What he is doing is the debt (old fashioned) way. Not bad, just the risk is more acute on a per loan basis. <br><br>And I would charge him *$25,000* *minimum*, and *outline the boundaries of the relationship*. <br>Otherwise you&#39;ll feel that you could have made just as much money flipping burgers at Burger King... Use my agreement. Email me for that. <br>        </p>

          Client&#39;s response to what their fund&#39;s preferred return and promote will be: &quot;Not Applicable. Need to discuss necessity for prospective institutional or private money.&quot; I&#39;m assuming he wants to know what is good and customary for the market he&#39;s targeting. <br><br>His offering, BTW, includes making loans to value-add NOO single family home projects where the average loan value is $254k. He&#39;s holding them for an average of 182 days.

          $1,000 to $2,000 provided you give him the info he needs *prior*; meaning you or your client fill out the investor questionnaire in the Fundraising Fundamentals pitch book formation system.         </p>

          So here’s where cynical Sal comes in. <br><br>I’m giving my money to a guy that like servicing? Well, he’s in the wrong business if he’s a lender. What he likes is the stable fees it brings in. <br><br>*Speaking from experience*, because that&#39;s all I can really state here, is that those who do their own servicing usually aren’t very good as deal sourcing rainmakers. Or raising capital. He’s managing the minutiae that pulls from his *2 jobs: finding deals and funding deals*.<br><br>I think it would show to his investors he is professionally mature and not the proverbial “chef, cook and bottlewasher”. <br><br>Let me profile this guy, he used to work in technology or something that make him very busy? So he feels productive most when doing the “busy” work and not the revenue generating work. <br><br>Clear Capital is a good BPO firm<br><br>Just a guess.         </p>

          I&#39;m acting the role of coach with him here. What you said about having him NOT servicing his own loans is where I&#39;ve been leading him. I think it&#39;s a matter of volume. With 30 loans and very carefully screened borrowers, it&#39;s been easy for him to service them. <br><br>His background is in sales / insurance. Always been a commission kind of guy. He does seem to like to do as much as he can though. You nailed that part. He takes great pride in the depth of his due diligence on his borrowers - which is pretty deep! <br><br>Thanks for the point towards Clear Capital!        </p>

          So here&#39;s a point worthy of some discussion: As you know, I have a client who has paid me $25k to create a pitch book for him and introduce him to institutional capital. His goal is to leverage his current deal flow to deploy $15mm - $12mm above the $3.2mm he currently has deployed. <br>Judging from his responses to the workbook, he is not ready. He is missing critical ingredients in almost every area. <br>My job has transformed from creating pitch book, to coaching him to be ready to craft a pitch book, THEN craft a pitch book, then introduce him to capital. I find myself having to shift fundamental paradigms; manage expectations, teach vocabulary and concepts; and in some areas, teach him his own business (like how to build a complete file). This guy is getting his $25k worth!<br>I don&#39;t mind doing this as it is inspiring me to create online course material around certain subjects that I will use over and over again, and it is forcing me to deep dive into details that I now have to teach, but it would be so much easier to service clients that simply needed a pitch book and capital introduction.         </p>

          I am sincerely looking forward to the &quot;get them up to speed&quot; part of the formula. There is no question in my mind that there is a demand for this service. I am working my way through the process of getting my clients up to speed with heavy supplementation from your two books, multiple $600+ books from PEI, Prequin, NCREIF, etc. <br><br>I found the &quot;sizing&quot; part is pretty easy to figure out once they start writing, but there is a lot of ground to cover sometimes. Definitely worthy of a fee. <br><br>The second thing I noticed as I dance around with another prospect claiming to be interested in a single asset pitch book, is that there&#39;s a line that should not be crossed. This guy is back and forth with me about individual terms of the agreement, but is clearly using our back and forth as a learning experience. I cut him off today - put him on ignore for a while. <br><br>In a typical exchange, he asks me a question that I know the answer to, but it takes me a bloody hour to respond (educate him). The next email he gets from me will come in a few days (after he pulses me again) that essentially says either pay me or stop draining my energy. <br><br>I think I just need a &quot;get them up to speed&quot; plan that I can plug these guys into when they show up. If they need that kind of help, then they pay a retainer as you suggest - else I set up an education system like the one you have through Dandrew media and shovel out content as needed.         </p>

          They, they will be schooling off of you hard, but just say that you&#39;ve got paying clients to work with and can&#39;t school him all day. <br><br>That&#39;s why you need a VA overseas or your wife to field these calls for you. <br><br>Radio silence will work wonders for you.

          Can you give us some detail around &quot;customary governance rights?&quot; <br>In one of your sample pitch books, you mention &quot;customary governance rights.&quot; The actual sentence reads: &quot;Generally minority stakes (5% to 25%) with customary governance rights,&quot; and is found in the Deal Structure subsection of the Investment Strategy.        </p>

          When a client mentions a name in a pitch book, it needs a bio, yes? What if they mention a name of an attorney or accountant when they are using an outside firm? I&#39;m going to assume they should simply use the name of the firm, and leave the names out; unless the name of the firm = the name of the person; or if the person has some material interest in the fund or is in partnership with the new fund manager. Am I close?        </p>

          Two deeper questions regarding a rediscount facility: <br><br>1. What becomes the cost of capital (on average) to the hard money lender who accepts this arrangement with an institutional capital provider? How much will an institutional capital provider charge (on average) to take the first 50% LTV position?<br><br>2. Will the hard money lender have to renegotiate relationships with his current private money lenders since the amount of total private capital will diminish (on a per deal basis), and yield on total capital deployed will change? <br><br>3. What impact on the hard money lender (and his private money sources)  is to be expected? <br><br>The reason for my questions: <br>I realize that in a re-discount facility arrangement, the manager still keeps points on the full amount loaned to (65% LTV), but I assume he will realize a lower spread on the capital provided by the institutional capital provider (50% LTV) on a deal by deal basis. <br><br>His private money sources currently provide 65% LTV on a deal by deal basis today. These same private money sources will ideally provide his contribution (15% LTV) to each deal after the rediscount facility is in place. <br><br>I&#39;m prepared to tell him that one way to keep the yeild to his private money sources constant is by making up the difference in sheer volume of additional loans to keep them happy. That means he will truly need to be confident that he can make 3 times more loans than he&#39;s making today in order for his rediscount facility to work. <br><br>Fortunately, deploying 3 times more loans is what he&#39;s looking to do. <br><br>What am In missing?        </p>

          Dave: <br><br>1. This is based on the collateral of what he will be lending on. What happens first is that the lender will review what this person has lend on, and how good he is at getting repaid back on his loans. Do his borrowers cash him out? Or is he constantly trying to extend and pretend that the loan will get paid off. *The tape is the soul of his business; it tells you what they are lending on, who they are lending to and how often they are churning money. It doesn’t lie.*  <br><br>Then the lender will draw a box and say this is what you can lend on and anything outside of this we won’t co-fund. <br><br>Fees and rates are usual, however, there could be some tricky fees such as if he doesn’t draw it down. <br><br>Lastly, a good rate range would be between a 7 – 9 handle. <br><br>2. Not really. The will be making more with less money in the deal. So the math for this can be done for this using the VigMaker Pro (which you have access to as a Placement Agent). It will show the pass-through spread between what the rehabber is paying through to the borrower. <br><br>(On a pool basis, the tool for this is  Private Mortgage Pool Financial Modeler™ Debt Model https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=418 – considering you’re a Placement Agent, you can get this by lobbing a ticket into the DandrewHelpDesk.com.) You need to play with this. <br>So now you’re asking what the hook is, right? Leverage will amplify the returns, the fund manager will get more points on less equity invested, and the private lenders or LPs will get more juice per loan because of the leverage. <br><br>The downside is that the equity is pledged as collateral as it is in the first loss position. What does that mean? It means if there is a loan at 65,000 made, the fund manager deploys 15,000 from his private lenders and the rest comes from the facility. <br><br>If something happens, where the asset is foreclosed on or sold for less than the 65,000, his equity is the first to get hit. Meaning if he sells for 55,000, then he lost 10,000 of his investor’s money. <br><br>Also, if he isn’t servicing these, or they’re not paying, he has to make the payments even though he’s not getting all of the payments. So make sure he saves his points into a slush fund as a management fee doesn’t customarily cover that. He can’t say “5% management fee as I have to pay for crappy loans…”<br><br>Now, what else can he do? He can transfer these defaulted or slow-performing notes onto a “hospital facility” but that is a story for the conference in May. OK? <br><br>I think this answers your question. I we have a continuing ed planned out to discuss all of these and we will once things calm down for me and I’m back in the LV office. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          &quot;What are ya going to do, Jack?&quot; <br>Last night, I took a call that made me recall those wonderful scenes from the movie Speed. In the movie, the antagonist, played by Dennis Hopper, puts our hero, Jack, played by Keanu Reeves, into impossible situations and taunts him.<br>&quot;What are ya going to do now, Jack. Huh? What are you going to do?&quot;<br><br>I want to doing something cool like shoot the victim in the leg. It hurts him like hell, but gets the job done and confuses the bad guy. Everyone goes home happy. <br><br>In this case, the bad guy was a money raising wanna-be. His contribution to &quot;the deal&quot; was to raise $1.7mm in equity. He raised zero, and didn&#39;t tell anyone until the last minute. Our hero, the buyer, did all the work putting the deal together, but made the mistake of taking his eyes off the money raising wanna-be partner. <br><br>This 80% seller financed deal is stabilized, has a few cool value plays, and might make a nice project for the right person or group. The contract is in place, buyers money is hard, and Monday represents another extension (and associated fee).  Our buyer is scrambling to see if there is a way out of his predicament. He called me. <br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s not much we can do here to save this guy&#39;s project, but I would like to hear from my pal Sal, or anyone else who is dealing with this sort of thing, what are some best practices for dealsing with these guys. Part of me says &quot;opportunity!&quot;  The other part says &quot;lost cause.&quot; <br><br>Cash at the ready could negotiate a strong position in this deal. Ownership interests are up for grabs as they booted the wanna-be. The DSCR is 2.29 at it&#39;s lowest point. The hold period is 2-5 years. <br><br>I&#39;m assuming this sort of thing might grab the interest of someone in a liquid position looking for a steady coupon. <br><br>What are your thoughts for dealing with deals on fire?         </p>

          Dave,<br><br>Just as the sun will rise, so will these opportunities come across your desk by people who do nothing expecting everything. <br>*Sal’s Rule #79: A lack of preparation on your behalf doesn’t constitute an emergency on my behalf.*<br><br>Here’s what I think, this deal may not be as hot as you think. Here’s why: if this guy couldn’t follow up with his “partner”, what makes you think he knows or has the aptitude as far as valuing this deal? Have you valued this deal yet using the 5 Data Points? <br>If it is a grand slam, then there is equity available for these, provided that you tell us what type of asset this is. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I ended up suggesting a capital stack inversion. It happens that I was chatting with Naedo that day and she asked if the seller would be willing to take back a second instead of a first. That set the wheels in motion and I thought: if he could get the seller to take up position higher in the capital stack, he might be able to get some cash out at closing and the sponsor might have an easier time raising capital. <br><br>I offered two solutions. One with seller taking back 50% (after a $2mm, 50% LTV debt loan) followed by a sponsor contribution of $800k CAPEX. I also offered a second solution in case the seller pushes back at going above the 80% LTV mark: to tranche the sellers take back into 30% at the 6% already agreed upon rate, and a second 20% at an 8% pref. <br><br>Here&#39;s an image of the solutions: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/sh/128fc177-ec3b-42fb-a3cf-1eddeb713ebc/92945de8382c5b4e6f87ad20608d3fe5<br><br>This guy&#39;s deal may be poop. I sincerely doubt that he has the moxie to double down on his earnest money and take it to serious investors. I also knew that it would never make it past the deal desk with such a short fuse.<br><br>He did get a taste of how creative structuring and/or real fundraising might be able to help his business - which is what I wa going for.          </p>

          This is brilliant. And much of what we&#39;ll be discussing May 28-30. <br><br>I like Option 2. <br><br>Remember, that real estate&#39;s primary benefit or burden is that it has a human element to it. This is what makes it inefficient. Stocks and bonds don&#39;t have a human element to it, but they are very efficiently priced. <br><br>So you&#39;re comment regarding this guys moxie is dead on. That is why deals fail. And how winners are created.         </p>

          Can you describe the essential characteristics, similarities and differences between a credit facility, a rediscount facility, and equity facility, and any other facility type I might not be asking about? <br><br>It would help a great deal to provide the menu of options to clients when they come seeking funding options. Many are simply not ready for a fund, but think they are. We&#39;d like to offer a stepping stone approach.        </p>

          Here&#39;s the reminder you asked me to post here during today&#39;s call: we&#39;re grateful for your offer to produce &quot;a crayon diagram of the transactional lifecycle.&quot; Context of our discussion today was pitch book formation. Client has existing hard money business and is distributing a little less than $5mm into SFR. The participants are his business, the capital provider (likely cultivated through Prequin) and the borrower / operator. We talked briefly through how we can tee this discussion up properly for LP&#39;s GP&#39;s. The crayon diagram you offered is a tool to help with that.         </p>

          Dave, <br><br>People used to make fun of my markers in the office. Now they are unemployed. Anyway, let’s chop some wood here. Of course you’d make me do infographics on a Saturday night. But since *you got the $25,000 cash in hand*, I think this merits rolling up our sleeves. <br><br>The attachment here will expire in 14 days. After that, I don’t know where it goes and it can be purchased I’m sure on DandrewMedia.com by then. <br><br>*https://www.hightail.com/download/UlRRa0ZUMGM5RmE1aWNUQw*<br><br>This schematic breaks out a hypothetical $100,000 hard money loan, where the Institutional money comes in and how they are protected when the asset is sold for less than 65,000. It shows who gets hurt, and who doesn’t get hurt. <br><br>This should be placed into the Pitchbook. Hire folks on Fiverr.com to make this slide for you. You may want to tweak this a little.<br><br>Sal        </p>

          This is effective, Sal. I don&#39;t care if it was literally on a napkin. I&#39;ve exchanged my share of napkin diagrams in the past and I am no genius with design either. When I get this one done by an actual graphics person, I&#39;ll send you a copy to do with as you see fit.<br><br>Here&#39;s what comes to mind: is the source of his (the hard money lender) current funds a concern that we should address with institutions? This client has pulled together about $5mm from mom and pop money. He&#39;s deployed most of it and would probably like to continue doing this in order to cover his newly leveraged 15%. <br><br>Might institutions be reluctant to invest alongside mom and pop funds?        </p>

          Early stages of working with a new client who needs a pitch book and ongoing capital. This client writes: <br><br>&quot;Do we have to engage you in order to get assistance and/or a template for a pitch book? If so, does the engagement letter price out that assistance (I have not seen it).&quot;<br><br>My draft response looks something like this: <br><br>&quot;The engagement letter spells out the terms for introducing XYZ to capital. We have a fee – flexible in the way is gets paid. Sometimes it’s all up front, sometimes it’s split and comes in part on the back end. Obviously up front ends up being less expensive. <br><br>We require a retainer to help with crafting your pitch book, working with you guys to get you ready, and making introductions. That covers the proprietary structure, financial modeling, graphics support, professional proof reading and edits, etc. XYZTrue Data pays for any travel &amp; other expenses, if required. <br><br>Our retainer is $25k. The fees in the engagement letter ranger from 1% (simple debt) to 5% of preferred equity provided to your company. <br><br>What are your thoughts around getting started?&quot;<br><br>Help me tweak this response?         </p>

          Dave  <br><br>This is a not-so-decent start. Let me trigger some action from them. Copy and paste what I have in bold. Remember, gamesmanship!<br><br>*Most of our clients already have a professionally placed deck ready for us to use. If you don’t have one, it is expected that you craft one. Otherwise we’re not going to be able to work with you. <br><br>However, this is a double-edged sword as if it doesn’t communicate the thesis appropriately, you will probably not get very far as most of these institutions have staff at the support level to weed out the flakes. <br><br>This deck requires you’re knowledge of the market, the asset and to be able to look at these numbers dispassionately. It’s more of an art than a science. We have a team of 2 analysts here that can do this for you. This includes the excel modeling and you’ll need to fill out our Pitchbook Workbook so we can craft and formulate your pitch for you. <br><br>The cost is $25,000 on this and we can turn this around inside of 3 weeks. Payment is due before we start work and I can send you wiring instructions for this. <br><br>The rights to the content is yours, and most clients use this as an evergreen marketing piece for future raises. <br><br>This is also critical as this is what is going to drive the language in the docs when we go to paper the deal. The atty’s will need something to base the transactional lifecycle off of this. <br><br>It’s a core competency and aptitude yard stick for sponsors in a market getting crowded…<br><br>Do you want me to add this language to the engagement letter before you execute?*         </p>

          Emerging Fund Manager screening question: What indicators / checklist should we use to determine if a person or team who SAYS they want a fund, are truly READY for a fund. What are some of your suggestions for keeping ourselves from working with amateurs / wasting our time? <br><br>Context: 20/20 hindsight is slapping me around today. I am working with a small group of professionals (a CPA, an Entrepreneur, a real estate broker type, the CEO of a mid-sized company, and a few others) with no deal book of their own who are looking to start a fund. They&#39;ve signed my engagement letter but paid me nothing (we have a verbal agreement to pay me in hope certificates). I know... and I won&#39;t be doing that again any time soon. <br><br>Assume this client claims to want to form a $250mm fund and has filed a PPM, but has little to no specificity in their filing (I have since discovered that it was filed without the benefit of an attorney - it&#39;s weak!). It is clear to me that this team of people knows nothing about portfolio theory, doesn&#39;t understand the math behind their own business model, and doesn&#39;t appear to have what I would consider a healthy focus on the welfare of their potential capital providers. I am losing hope that I will be able to take them to the big show. <br><br>I helped them word smith their documents. Now they call and email me more than any other client - nights, weekends... I stopped taking their calls without an appointment. <br><br>They are proving themselves to be a resource drain beyond what I feel they have a right to ask me for. Experience NOW tells me that had I had a proper screening process in the beginning, I would have probably spent my time elsewhere - or put them on a drip education program until they were ready for the big show. (Something I am considering now). <br><br>Frustrated, but adapting.         </p>

          Jeez Dave... This makes me cranky just seeing this. <br><br>anyone can say that they want $250mm. Tell them this has taken more time than you signed up for and that you&#39;re going to need to focus on other things for the foreseeable future. <br><br>Just get the hell out.

          Sal is my pal. Good day to you. Watching your videos on F.F. Question about &quot; MY EDGE&quot;. If I do not have any experience doing any raises or have been out of the real estate game for a bit- - can my edge be my intellectual capital- so to speak through training that you give? Also can I not now be a sponsor of a deal because I do have specialized knowledge? After all- we all need to start somewhere....... For example- I am looking at a 72 unit mf now here in my state. Negotiating the price down to where I need it to be with good upside. I can be the sponsor of this deal and do a deck or a raise for the funds to get in the deal- debt and equity- great property management team, etc. I feel I could be the sponsor on this deal even without experience running a 72 unit but have knowledge to get it done through utilizing or delegating responsibilities to experts in their field. Thoughts?        </p>

          My thoughts exactly. <br>This client brings $25k up front in the form of a retainer. The rest is in accordance with the agreement. I get paid when I bring in money. If I had compensation up front, I would think there would be a claim to more accountability. As it stands, I get nothing beyond the retainer if I don&#39;t produce capital. He loses nothing. <br>That retainer just keeps the lights on while I hunt. <br><br>How do you think I should word my reply?         </p>

          How do you think I should word my reply? I am a little confused as to how we can put in writing any differently that we will be taking responsibility for our actions (page 3, para 1). As it stands, we don&#39;t get paid if we don&#39;t bring in capital, and the Dandrew engagement letter already lists out what we&#39;ll do for the retainer.         </p>

          I&#39;d love to get some color around the generally accepted pool of rights and remedies. I think it would help placement agents when advising clients. <br><br>The basis for my question is simple: you put me on this path. In the near future, we will be on our first road show. My client will need to present a believable case for securing institutional investor&#39;s capital - and he will have to understand the limits of his negotiating ability. <br><br>He&#39;s telling me (when prompted) that he&#39;s going to secure capital using methods usually reserved for mom and pop investors who put up funds via a syndication or TIC for an individual property. His fund is going to be secured a little differently. <br><br>I assumed it will be done through the operating agreements, but you taught us that institutional capital will have a voice. Between the lines, I&#39;ve deduced that capital providers will each have unique rules they must follow in order to secure their investor&#39;s capital. It makes sense that they will want fund manager&#39;s operating agreements to make allowances for their &quot;voice&quot; and investing parameters.         </p>

          Engagement letter executed and in hand. Need to raise $250mm around a business plan/pitchbook that allows owners of commercial property who have large utility bills to triple the NOI of that property within 120 days. <br><br>We need to finish his pitchbook, but figure it&#39;s a good idea to start thinking about where we are going to take it. I&#39;m hoping for a point in the right direction.         </p>

          I can explain more when we next speak privately. It&#39;s business model specific and proprietary. I&#39;m under agreement. It makes good sense for what we&#39;re doing on that project, but I&#39;m not sure how applicable it is to the rest of your community.         </p>

          Working through pitch book creation with my $250mm fund client. Can you give some examples of typical promote/carry structures that a Fund Manager can expect to receive? I&#39;m equally as interested in when they should expect to be compensated, as well as what method (% and/or fee), and how much. <br><br>I&#39;m guessing the structure changes with experience, so please give us the range from emerging manager to more seasoned. I acknowledge that everything is negotiated, but I want to help with expectations setting.         </p>

          As you know, I&#39;m getting ready to execute my second engagement letter this week. This one to organize a pitch book and do a raise around a smallish $15mm hard money fund. <br><br>My client raised a very few minor points in our engagement letter. Thought I&#39;d share them with the group and get your thoughts, if any. I figure if I&#39;m seeing these types of comments, others will see them too: <br>1. Bullet #5 should read &quot;of&quot; instead of &quot;if.&quot; &lt;- no big deal, but good for all of us to correct the typo. <br>2. Bullet #6: he asked to strike &quot;for the property&quot; because in his case, I&#39;m raising capital for his fund vs for a property. &lt;-again, no big deal. Just customizing. <br>3. He pointed out that he (the CLIENT) is to indemnify the AGENT, but that the AGENT is not indemnifying the CLIENT against misrepresentation.  I thought this was a little odd to ask for, since the CLIENT should have no occasion to represent the AGENT, but hey... I&#39;m letting him have it. <br>4. He asked about Mezzanine, and why we only charge 3% for each transaction. I really didn&#39;t have a good answer for him - other than to say many mezz lenders are dead today. We still provide the service when appropriate, and that 3% is the going rate.         </p>

          Sal - Tomorrow afternoon, I am meeting (again) with the client you and I have discussed off line. This client has a mature system, a lot of experience, a good track record, and a differentiated strategy that I believe we can prove. Of all the contacts I&#39;ve made to date, he&#39;s likely in the best position to begin the process of becoming a fund manager. I&#39;m helping him with expectations and providing big-picture tomorrow and have three questions:<br>1. What are your thoughts re: Timeline - how long should he be expected to invest before he gets his fund capitalized?  (Prequin says avg was 17.5 months in 2012, but you have recent experience and contacts) <br>2. Resource commitment: What can I tell him that will put him in the ball park of what he should expect to invest to get this up and running: internal compliance, pitch book, reporting, road show, registration, ongoing operations?  <br>3. What is the current market sentiment regarding stabilized and mid-range value add product? Do you think he&#39;s got a chance, given what you already know, to differentiate enough to attract institutional capital? <br>        </p>

          Dave<br>These are great questions. I’m (trying to be) on vacation this week so sorry I’ve not responded faster. Here are the answers to your questions.<br>1.  What does this question mean by “invested”? <br>“how long should he be expected to invest before he gets his fund capitalized?”<br><br>2.  40K – 60K. That’s conservative on the higher-end and you’ll probably be able to get these expenses compressed too a little. <br><br>3.  There are a lot of players in this niche, its getting crowded. So you’re strategy has to be specific and refined. Just buying apts isn’t going to get anyone excited. But you do know this after working with us. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Interested in the size of the Dandrew box re: pref equity. Is it the same as for debt lending or can the pref equity box flex smaller?<br><br>I saw two deals from a team over lunch this afternoon. Both low value requirements: $200k - $400k. One isn&#39;t worth mentioning as they already have capital for it. The second, for which they need $400k (likely pref equity)  is to complete a debt stack that will acquire and reposition a self storage, a mobile home park, and a piece of land as a 3-part single package. They are getting in at a good basis in a Carolina tertiary market due to mismanagement, low occupancy and repositioning - lot&#39;s of hair. The acquisition is assisted by seller financing and has a few interesting upsides: like an extra parcel of land and a few good uses for it. <br><br>$400K seems like it may be in the &quot;too small for Sal&quot; category, but it is representative of deals that this group sees (and closes on) regularly - several times per year. I thought I&#39;d ask.         </p>

          $400K is too small for *anyone* in this space. They&#39;re better off paying you 10K to get a deck and some docs together so you can raise this on demand from other investors. <br><br>AJ and I are testing a very experienced atty to do PPM, Subscription Agreement and Operating Agreements for less than 2K for this NNN fund. <br><br>Email me next week for his contact. That is adding value right there. Immense value. <br><br>I&#39;m I&#39;m crazy enough, I may actually place the call as part of a Continuing Ed... <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Incredible value. That attorney is going to have business, certainly from me, if your test works out. <br><br>Following your advice, coupled with your attorney, costs my client $12K total + 5% of money raised, earns them a deck, my labor, and a stable of golf and cigar investors to fund their deal. <br><br>We set up an SPE (two actually) using the docs the attorney created and use one as a funding entity to fund a limited partner entity in the deal. Do I have that right? <br><br>I&#39;m used to Reg D syndication - which typically costs another $15-25K to paper, and background checks to ensure investors are accredited.         </p>

          Sal - when we are fund raising on behalf a client as a result of an executed engagement letter, who do you recommend does the SEC compliance portion of the golf and cigar guy&#39;s financial status? The client, us, or both?         </p>

          May be weedy because I&#39;m actively in meetings this week - just left one 90 minute ago. Questions come up as I go along: Client name M.A. signs engagement letter. Our agreement is that I will help her raise capital on an asset by asset basis for two years. 1st use case is a mobile home park. Likely to need some pref equity (and maybe a bridge) to close. I reach out to my network - you, a second funding source + golf and cigar guys. <br><br>As we consider my golf and cigar guys, M.A. and I both want to make sure these guys are accredited and capable of sustaining a loss - verified by 2 yrs prior tax filings. Should the verification be part of the service we provide to M.A. - thus suggesting that we keep the records on file in our office - or should the client (M.A.) be pulling those two years of tax records - or should we both be doing this?         </p>

          Two years for a raise? No. 6 months x2. <br><br>What happens if NYC is nuked? Or LV? Or something happens where the markets freeze up? <br><br>Who&#39;s idea was 2 years? That is too long.         </p>

          This isn&#39;t about spending two years for a single raise. It would be making fundraising services available for two years at agreed upon fee schedule without having to renew the engagement letter. <br><br>Why would I not want to raise money - or attempt to raise money - for this company&#39;s deal flow for the next two years? They are closing 4-5 deals per year. To me, that represents 4-5 K-1 and fee opportunities per year. <br><br>I suppose I&#39;m not following.  <br><br>My question was about the compliance work, but I&#39;m happy to discover a second opportunity to excel. <br>        </p>
