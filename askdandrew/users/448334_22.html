          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve decided in my commercial funding business to focus on three food groups, Multi family, medical office and warehouse. North Texas has a lot going on in the warehouse space.<br><br>My question us aside from the lending parameters already established by Dandrew, are there any additional caveats that need to be in the deal to make it worthwhile for Dandrew to fund outside of tenant type, lease duration and expiration, etc.        </p>

          Al, <br><br>These are not for us. This is for a local rehabber to buy. Perfect to be able for the seller to sell on wraps. <br><br>I would negotiate a deal with him that has seller financing in it - *on an individual asset basis* - then sell off each one by the shot to other rehabbers. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Since banks really cannot lend at this time and have been now in a position in some cases to have a lot of excess capital and have been buying loans from other banks, aren&#39;t they still needing to follow regulatory laws and are limited in how much they can actually buy from another bank?<br><br>If Dandrew is bidding on loans from a bank and another bank is also a bid on the same pool, isn&#39;t the bank in a better position to win that bid because their basis level is different from say a firm such as Dandrew?        </p>

          *If Dandrew is bidding on loans from a bank and another bank is also a bid on the same pool, isn’t the bank in a better position to win that bid because their basis level is different from say a firm such as Dandrew?*<br><br>Excellent question. Its not the *basis level*, its their *cost of capital*. It may be cheaper. Gordon will cover this at the workshop in depth, but if they have a cheaper cost of capital they can bid higher. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick question. On loan pools, is the minimum asset value $60K just as it is with Bulk REO?. A mortgage company has a pool of 215 loans they want an all-in on. The FMV is in the neighborhood of $33K.<br><br>Also have a pool from a different seller of 268 loans in Michigan, P and NPN that can be carved out. They told me it are land contracts and they are willing to let carve outs occur.<br><br>They said while most who allow cherry picking/ carve outs will expect a premium price for the right, they are in lieu of charging a premium, want the buyer to buy a minimum of 5.<br><br>Should I send the tape on the 268?        </p>

          Sal,<br>We ran into a problem today and had to get our attorney on this. The seller has an intern that released the tape when it was nit supposed to be released.<br><br>It has about 10% of assets in Detroit with the other 90% throughout Michigan. The tape was not to be released because the seller, an investment company was in process on doing workouts and other processes underway.<br><br>I got my attorney involved because I wanted to be sure we weren&#39;t in the middle of something we didn&#39;t need to be in. I knew we weren&#39;t but I wanted to be sure.<br><br>Anyway, as it turns out, the seller is an investment company that buys SFR&#39;s from banks, rehabs them if needed then resells them and holds the paper. They sell using the land contract process.<br><br>He has 6000 loans right now, throughout the country that he wants to sell and  is willing to discuss with me. He said his pricing expectations are between 43 and 50% of the UPB, depending upon the property, jurisdiction, how much they have into it, etc.<br><br>He said they could sit in these through the term but they really want to liquidate and reinvest because this is their business model. These guys are professional investors who understand the market, the business, financing, asset liquidation, modeling, etc.<br><br>He asked me about deals I&#39;ve been involved with not necessarily closed. He said he likes to know my story on deals I&#39;ve done, what I did with them, he said a lot of deals never see closing so he can&#39;t base a decision on my experience and capabilities by being concerned with only closed deals.<br><br>I told him about the rough deals I sent over to you, but never mentioned Dandrew or you. He said he was glad I mentioned them. He said they don&#39;t buy rough assets in war zones or at sub par pricing just to buy something. He said his firm buys turn keys but rehabs to bring the properties up to their standards and are mostly cosmetics anyway.<br><br>He said their name and their stamp is in every deal so each property must be at a certain level, as it enables them to sell at better prices.<br><br>I will keep you posted.        </p>

          JV/Mezz Loan: Mining/Exploration Canada: Graphite, Titanium, Gold, Silver and Other Minerals  <br><br>Sponsor has a 25-year ironclad lease on the 8,200 acre land located in Canada that has various types of mineralization that were shown in the previous years of exploration.  Over $7 mil has been spent to date to drill 146 holes that were tested all positive; the most important asset is the presence of Graphite (mineral that will revolutionize the chip technology), Titanium, Gold, Silver, Copper, and many others.   The land is valued today at more than $50 billion, and was divided in several zoning for mining: <br><br>M Zone: Significant Sedex type polymetallic precious metal massive sulphide deposit. Drilled indicated <br>and inferred resource of 1.2 million tons grading 9.85 oz. /t Silver, 6.06 % Zinc, 2.67% Lead, 0.06% Copper<br>and .026 oz. /t Gold down to the 1300 foot level.  Screen Analysis was done on 2 drill holes and the Silver<br>assays averaged 20 ounces/T and the Gold came out at 3 grams/t. Based on the type of deposit and the geology<br>data, experts believes the M Zone has 3 times the resource indicated.<br><br>Project would start with mining the M zone. Potential Gross Annual Revenue (USD) (Ag, Zn, Pb, Au, Cu) <br>= $ 134,806,600 <br><br>G Zone: Graphitic Argillite and Titanium: <br><br>Deep penetration electromagnetic survey (six drill holes) as well an Airborne EM survey picked the huge<br> Graphitic Argillite Horizon ranging in width from 46 to 149 feet.      <br>Samples of core were submitted to SGS Research, Lakefield and assayed up to 2% Graphitic Carbon.  <br>Important to note that this horizon contains 14 pounds/Ton of Titanium which can be easily recovered by floatation producing a high grade Titanium concentrate.     <br><br>C Zones: The C Lake area continues to return very encouraging gold and base metal assays associated with<br> Arsenopyrite in structural and volcanic terrains. Recent drilling has intersected Gold values up to 13 g/t over 0.5m, <br>8 g/t over 3 m, 2.4 g/t over 8.8 m and 4.3 g/t over 1.4 m. Sampling from trenches assayed 0.5 oz. /t Gold.<br><br>Current market value of the land = $50 billion<br>Skin in the game = land ($50 billon)+ $20 million<br>Loan Request = $200 million for mining <br><br>I know this is another “Big Elephant” project you are not interested in, but this may be big deal for an investor you may know, who has money and wants to secure his future and the future of his children/grandchildren. I am bringing these deals to you first, Sal before giving them away. <br>By the way, the NY city construction projects are going on pretty well so far; we’ll see!<br>        </p>

          Fulga <br><br>Give this one away. Its not for anyone I know. Actually, be careful because a lot of fraud happens with these deals. I wouldn&#39;t be pitching these deals really. Here&#39;s usually how they blow up and rip off unsuspecting investors. I&#39;ve seen this so many times in oil and this is the same way. <br><br>First,  you find a giant patch of dirt with no oil in it, have your engineers declare a trillion or two in recoverable reserves, issue stock against that valuation, sell enough stock to buy yourself a new Bentley, Rolls Royce and a Gulfstream V jet. Then you buy a few drill rigs for show, syphon a few hundred billion to the cayman&#39;s, reassess your trillion dollar fields and realize there&#39;s no oil, and poof... File Chapter 7. <br><br>Same with minerals. I know, I know, your deal is great. But they all follow the same script. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Where *exactly* are you with the NYC deal. Has it been papered yet? <br><br>         </p>

          Fulga,<br>I&#39;ve seen a lot of these deals lately. They all seem to talk about revenues yet when you ask certain questions, you always get the same answers which are, we just started drilling or mining, were in beginning stages, we&#39;ve spent a lot of money on dd and land studies, feasibility studies, etc.<br><br>Many of these are small companies and the question I always pose is, if this land and it&#39;s tracts are so heavy with the commodity being mined for, how come the larger players with larger capital resources don&#39;t know about it. The old saying of they aren&#39;t making any more land comes into play.<br><br>The other question posed always is how much additional money can fit into the capital stack and where do you want us comes into play as in any deal.<br><br>The usual answer is we need 100% funding. The answer to that is not going to happen. If they had the funds to do these expensive studies why do they not have any equity to put in?<br><br>Why do I see these deals? Because I&#39;m in Dallas and Fort Worth, home of many of these companies and they all want huge amounts of equity capital.<br><br>These deals are known as Dreams of fools because only unsophisticated people looking for the once in a life time Microsoft type score invest in these.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

I believe that this website as you said is a statement piece. <br><br>I am thrilled to be aligned with Dandrew and lif this is just the first of what is to come, than what lies ahead is what everyone should be excited about.<br><br>Well done, well, well done.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I think I&#39;m about to ask a question that may have never been asked before. Now while I don&#39;t have a deal firmed up, I have been asked about the potential of this deal that follows...<br><br>Very experienced sponsor operator, has done in excess of $40M in deals to date ranging from SFR to MF and some industrial as well. Here is what they want to do.<br><br>They want to buy LLC&#39;s that contain very strong cash flowing MF properties. They want to then sell off some of the properties and repay the debt stack within 12 to 18 months and the remaining properties would be portfolio&#39;d then sold at a later time to raise capital for additional investments in some higher risk ventures.<br><br>They have 35% equity in capital reserves that they would be willing to block into escrow. If their available equity is not enough, they can partner with another entity who would go onto the deal and the loan with them. They also have some additional assets they can pledge to cross collateralize. They mentioned a free and clear citation plane and I said that it must be real estate. I told them planes go down in value every hour they fly and the market for planes isn&#39;t exactly robust if my capital provider had to try and liquidate.<br><br>Any initial thoughts?<br><br>        </p>

          They said that they own several unencumbered assets such as this Citation 10 private jet that they own. The escrow thing came from them. They are willing to block the funds into an escrow account so that the money is held aside.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Hope all is well. I have been posting some on LinkedIn. Anyway- I say I am direct to hedge fund. Is this the right verbiage to use? Some of responses do not believe it as they say that hedge funds can find their own tapes. I then say MAYBE- BUT in this case they are too busy doing capital raises and other things so why not delegate this to guys like me and others???? That is that. I believe this is it... LinkedIn is not the best place to find deals but a great way to build some relationships to do deals outside of LinkedIN. Thanks!!!<br>        </p>

          Richard, I just tell them that my firm is backed by a  large fund that provides capital to do my deals. I never use the term Hedge Fund because many people don&#39;t really understand what a hedge fund does anyway.        </p>

          Richard, I agree to an extent about Linked In. Not the best place to find a deal but great to network. I have 2009 connections, all deal makers, but it comes down to informing them of what we do.<br><br>If you look at the summaries on potential connections, they all mainly say the same or near same thing. You have to stand out in what you say in your summary section.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Got my first tape over- performing- FL., GA., MO,TX,IND,some other states. 9.56 mill UPB. They have a lot of good info on it. Do not have credit on borrowers and finding out if the loans are recourse or not.<br>1 kicker- all 30 year terms with 3 year arm- Int rates go up to 10%. Seasoned average of approx 7-10 months.  So am gaging sellers expectations to see if we can move forward. Do you need credit on payors before the tape is sent? These are performing mind you. Thanks!!!        </p>

          Sal - Do all of the capital products offered right now come with a &quot;Recourse&quot; provision or would there just need to be a form of collateral obligation should anything go wrong in a value-add deal?         </p>

          Brady: <br><br>This is an excellent question. And believe it or not, we do have an infographic that discusses this! See on the DandrewMedia.com website “Carrots and Sticks”. <br><br>But recourse is a negotiated “carrot and stick”; meaning sometimes it’s there, sometimes it’s not. <br><br>There is a convention called “springing recourse”, where there might not be recourse layered on at some point if specific milestones aren’t accomplished in a timely matter or otherwise. <br><br>Remember, these are usually applied on *value-added* deals where there is a lot of heavy lifting that needs to be done. <br><br>Sal        </p>

They called me at 10 pm last night and said why do you need this information meaning the 5 data points and I said because we need this to determine If we want to provide debt on this and he said, wait, you are capital guys, I said yes, sometimes were debt and sometimes were equity.<br><br>He said oh I am the owner of the property, I&#39;m looking to off load this.

Can I put this on my website now?<br><br>We’re one of a few national finance companies that functions as a “one-stop shop.” Our firm specifically focuses on middle market financing (total asset value of $50 million and less) and has reclaimed the space left by many commercial real estate finance companies that did not survive the last downturn. <br><br> Our new bridge loan program will focus on transitional loans with the following parameters: <br><br> Size: $2 – 10mm <br><br> Term: 1 – 4 years <br><br> Rates: 5.5 – 6.5% (fixed or floating) <br><br>LTV: Up to 75% <br><br> The program is available to acquisitions, refinancing, and mini perms.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am in contact with a group that is in contract to buy a nice class &#39;A&#39; apartment complex in Charleston, SC. for $11.6mm. He has qualified for a FNMA loan, including the 10% liquid, and is trying to raise $3.2mm for the 20% down. What he would rather do is to get one lender for debt (long term, low interest rate) and an equity investor for the equity portion. I have a 12 page Investment Summary. <br><br>I know that this is not the Dandrew wheelhouse but do you know of anybody that might be able to help?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I meet with an attorney that does work and has direct access with small to regional banks about acquiring NPN&#39;s. His work is primarily in the southeast. He is open to the ideal or working with us to source notes from these banks, if he  could do the legal work after the notes are purchased.

          During the most recent conference call. A large part of the discussion centered around the 3 income streams generated from a Commercial Real Estate Deal. My question is does the Intermediary ( me) have to pay for the Sponsor out of the money we collect in the three income streams??<br>&gt;I heard that a good sponsor can be found by me putting the word out at LinkedIn. If that is my responsibility, I think I have to contract and pay the sponsor??<br>&gt;<br>&gt;================================<br>Hello : Based on the last conference call, I have a question : Please see above. Thank you.        </p>

          Rocky, your making things too technical. I understand your getting back into the game. The strategies have not changed per se , just the markets. As far as paying people who you enlist onto your team in a deal, yes your going to have to pay them.<br><br>Your not paying the sponsor, it&#39;s these folks who are the beneficiary of the loan funds. The sponsor is the operator of the property.        </p>

          Sal, here is what I have right now and I&#39;m working on getting the deal together. A hotel in Dallas is expanding and has already acquired a vacant property directly across the street. They&#39;ve begun demo work already. Behind the newly acquired property sits a vacant parking structure, they said I believe is four stories.<br><br>They want to acquire the structure, and are looking at possibly taking an acquisition loan. My intern knows the owner of the hotel personally. He went to SMU with the owners son.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was approached by a CFO of an investment firm in Atlanta that buys SFR&#39;s from banks in portfolios and they resell the entire portfolios. They employee  the buy low and mark up a bit to make a profit, which gives them some pricing fluctuation capabilities.<br><br>They are looking for a source who can buy these deals from them. They make their profits in volume, not one shot deals. They understand what were looking for.<br><br>They were so excited to be connected that they had someone they know send me a portfolio of 17 SFR&#39;s in Texas, $2.4M dollar value, all rented, minimum asset value $85K up into the $200K neighborhood. $26K per month in rent flow.<br><br>The buyer they were working with is out of capital. Before I send the deals, I want to make sure it&#39;s T&#39;d up for you.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal, the seller of the SFR&#39;s is trying to play a game of cat and mouse with me on this. They cannot come to the conclusion of their pricing expectations. I was very nice and very professional and simply said, without pricing expectations we simply are not going to be able to bid on your portfolio. I also reiterated that we would not be a bid on anything under 60K. They are without a doubt a mom and pop seller.<br><br>I wanted to update you on this. I have also received another portfolio in the neighborhood of about $4.7 million and I am waiting on their pricing expectations.<br><br>I am feeling as you may be on this that this is not going to be able to be bid on, I will see where they stand on Monday and advise.        </p>

          Sal,<br>My intern and I got together last week and we decided that in order to move forward and be more productive in our deal flow sourcing, we need to target our marketing to those sources outside of private sellers who are really mom and pops who have product but are unsophisticated.<br><br>We&#39;ve seen deals from these types of sellers that do to know their pricing expectations or are wanting par for product that is rough.<br><br>My intern began reaching out to a clientele that is more sophisticated and are actual investment firms such as the bulk buyers in Atlanta. We are learning however that not all investment firms who are deemed sophisticated are not really that.        </p>

          Good strategy. Love it. <br>The mom and pops don’t understand the market really, the look at things very myopically, to say the lease. Somewhere they buy these assets and never realize what the market is paying for these. Then the market beats them up, realizes that your not a vulture and then comes back to you. <br><br>Time and circumstance will change all mom and pop buyer’s minds at some point. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Good day Sal. I am curious about something. Would Dandrew consider buying a bank that is in trouble? Would this even be feasible as it occurred to me that why not buy a bank with some non performing loans on there and this way you have them at a great price? Are there regulations that might prevent Dandrew from acquiring a bank??? Anyway- just a thought and if you would even consider this. Thanks!!!        </p>

          Richard<br><br>This is something Fred and I tried doing in 2010 via a bank recapitalization fund. The problem is that “problem” banks become “healthy” again through accounting legerdemain….

          Rocky, when you do it the way Sal says to with regard to the FDIC site, you have the choice of over $1B and 1B and under. I focus on banks under $1B which us what Sal says to do.        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br>I’ve received a proposal for a bridge loan $7.5mm for an apartment project in Jersey City across from Lower Manhattan.  It consists of rehabbing 2 existing vacant buildings for new apartments and upgrading available parking lot and garage.  The 16 apartments already in place are currently 100% occupied.  The bridge loan will pay off existing notes and construct 30 new apartments.  I know this is probably not in Dandrew’s wheelhouse.  However, would any of your cowboys possibly be interested with further info submitted?  Thanks.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been seeing the name CrePig show up here a few times and wanted to provide some insight on it. Crepig is not a deal site or a site for anything meaningful.<br><br>The deals you will come across will always have send POF and LOI attached to it. You will ask for information to be sent and never receive it, ask me how I know, well I will tell you.<br><br>As a test, I replied to someone. I introduced myself, talked about what I do, my experience level and then started to talk various cocktail terms and zero reply and zero information. I informed the person that I needed specific information.<br><br>When I looked at the same posting again, I noticed that others received the deal. I noticed that they were nothing more than brokers who knew nothing. I realized that the poster knew he was not going to easily get a deal done through an experienced person.<br><br>Your going to spin your wheels and get nowhere fast.        </p>

          Sal,<br>If you were starting all over again and you started with a deal flow and wanted to hire an intern, how would you pay them? would it be a salary plus incentives, a % of deal fees? what are your recommendations?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Generally speaking, interns don’t really get paid. However, over the past few years some have been getting paid from larger firms. Now you’re not a larger firm. Legendary Intern Peter Kasyanenko put together a very robust and comprehensive system called Intern Intel Private Coaching Series. It is one of the crowd favorites. To learn more about that, go to here: <br>  <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathnifeu <br><br>The way you want to do this is give them pieces of the deal that close. They are learning the business  - and there are very few finance or business majors who *don’t* want to learn this business – in exchange for college credit and experience. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          James: <br><br>Catch-ups are more prevalent in the opportunity fund (value added) sector. This is a defined split of profits that go to the investor and fund sponsor. A high catch-up split would be 80/20 that is 80 percent to the fund sponsor and 20 percent to the investor until such time as the sponsor has received its 20 percent return on overall profits. Even though the catch-up mechanism<br>would normally kick in at the preferred return – for example, 9 percent – it would mean that for every dollar of profit over and above the 9 percent return, the fund sponsor would get 80 cents until the sponsor has received its 20 percent return on overall profit. <br><br>Now this has changed a bit since 2008, but as is everything with these types of opportunistic funds, everything is negotiable. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a question regarding recurring deals where your buying from same seller multiple times. Let&#39;s say in the case of the pool your looking at that I sent over and you buy it and I earn let&#39;s say a 2% fee. Let&#39;s say you buy another deal from same seller the following month, who determines the IM&#39;s fee on each subsequent deal?<br><br>Or is it a case where they come to me and say would your fund buy again, then that deal generates a fee that I decide upon?        </p>

Completely renovated in January of this year.<br><br>This is a value-add opportunity. Recent income bump due to rent increases. Now, what would make this a value-add opportunity?

          James: <br><br>Rent increases are a catch 22. I wouldn’t go into this thinking you can increase rents arbitrarily, after all many a mult-family newbie thought they could raise rates. If the market resists, you’ll get killed. <br><br>In retail, these rents generally need to be disclosed prior usually though rent escalation clauses. The market isn’t too kind to rent increases today, so I would say this isn’t a meaningful value-added play. <br><br>And neither is reducing expenses, for that matter…<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Oops, the new deal is under $1M, the 5 notes were all commercial, each note above $200K each. My error in adding the last comment. It&#39;s the deal I accidentally sent to deals as well as you.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just received a new deal from the same seller for the 5 note deal I believe your working on. Now this is a single note, NPN on a 40 unit MF in St. Louis, secured by a $912,000.00 first mortgage.<br><br>The question I have is this. Would a deal like this be attractive because the asset is a multi family as opposed to a SFR? I know this is a small deal and not really what would fit into Dandrew&#39;s criteria.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I went out and secured a domain name under jbcapital.ws. I setup emails for that domain as follows...<br>jb@jbcapital.ws, deals@jbcapital.ws, and info@jbcapital.ws., can you suggest any additional one&#39;s that I&#39;m not thinking about? I took your advice and got away from the gmail stuff.<br><br>Also, is it better to have a toll free number in addition to a local number? I am ramping up to really start acquiring and implementing the credibility tools, seeing that I have really begun seeing alot of deal flow.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just keep getting these massive deals on what seems like a daily basis. I have been presented with a huge deal. It is for $856M in loans. <br><br>I am questioning the deal because they&#39;ve presented a offering of Memorandum. This seems like more of a capital raise or syndication deal.<br><br>I remember that recently you replied to someone here and said sometimes these deals, even at the massive dollar volumes are actually very real.<br><br>On a deal like this, if it was analyzed and determined to be a real deal, how would a deal like this be structured? would Dandrew syndicate this deal or would it be structured where a larger fund partners with Dandrew?        </p>

          James. <br><br>In this case, the burden of proof is on you to prove to me why you think this $1 billion deal is legit. <br><br>We&#39;re smaller balance players; the reason is becuase that is where we are the biggest fish in the pool. Why does this person need you and not Goldman Sachs to move this trade? <br><br>So before you ask us questions on a hypothetical basis, why you feel as though this is legitimate enough to talk about? Did you peel back any layers of the onion yet? <br><br>Why Due Diligence did you do before merely placing a question here? I don&#39;t see anything of substance here.

          I actually have looked at the Offering Memorandum. I was asking really as a chance to get some insight from you as to how a O.O.M. correlates into this being an offer from a seller of product to sell already existing inventory in their house as opposed to someone looking to either establish a fund to acquire these large pools or syndicate some capital to buy assets.<br><br>I have not looked at many O.M.&#39;s only because I have not been presented with one. My thinking is that I can make performance and incentive fees for each investor I bring to this deal, sort of as if I bought an accredited investor to a Dandrew Fund.<br><br>I really need to look at this and its merit.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Actually here is what prompted me to suggest this. Two weeks ago there was that exchange between Fulga and yourself and I chimed in with my four and a half cents and I caught a bit of flack.<br><br>Molly replied and said that members just wanted to get a better understanding of what causes deals to lose traction in the initial preliminary analysis once a deal is deemed to be worth taking a look at.<br><br>I am paraphrasing her comments because truthfully I don&#39;t remember them. I too recently have had some deals lose traction, well truthfully they never gained any, so I was thinking, wouldn&#39;t it be a good educational tool for those submitting deals to understand what causes a deal to lose traction, what are the factors that come out in the wash so to speak, that would make you say, you know, this is not going to be a pass.<br><br>I think that most have never been in the war room so to speak where analysts are actually looking at a deal, discussing it and figuring out how to underwrite the deal.<br><br>I enjoy everything you do, and I will be the first to tell anyone that working with you is for me, the best choice I ever made.        </p>

          Sal,<br>This is not really deal related but more for educational purposes. Just as your wife has you watching that hotel turnaround show, my kids have me watching Shark Tank.<br><br>The one shark who stands out is Kevin O&#39;Leary, the Venture Capitalist. I&#39;ve known many VC&#39;s from my days in the street and they don&#39;t invest in small ventures.<br><br>Why would a guy who is a fund manager such as O&#39;Leary invest in mom and pop businesses? what is the attraction of trying to scale a business that generates $50,000.00 a year into a multi million dollar entity?<br><br>Also, if I walk into the Shark Tank and I ask for $200,000.00 for a 10% equity interest in my business! I&#39;m obviously valuing my business at $2,000,000.00 and that value is not where my business is at valuation wise, how can accepting an offer of $200,000.00 and giving up 40% equity take my business from not being worth $2,000,000.00 to all of a sudden being worth substantially more?        </p>

          Thank you for this insight. I think most people would be quite surprised to find these folks aren&#39;t that rich. If they were, why are they doing this tv show as my wife puts it.        </p>

          Sall,<br>I was approached by a bank and right now I don&#39;t want to put the cart before the horse and say who they are, they said they want to sell their entire portfolio, everything, and he confided that they are already in trouble, very deep and they no longer want to make mortgage loans, they want to convert to a small business bank and divest themselves out if what they have.<br><br>I asked the size of the pool and he said over $200M. He said they would be willing to sell in tranches over a negotiated time frame until everything is liquidated.<br><br>I&#39;ve handled it this way. I said the fund I&#39;m backed by is very real, so much more real than most you&#39;ll come into contact with that they use very specific tools that enable them to see into a banks standing (I was referring to the FDIC tool), that they are principal bids, that they are liquid, and that before I even move to determine their interest, I need a Bio on all the principals, a overview of exactly what their portfolio consists of in terms of loans, types, volumes, % of P, RP, NP, etc.<br><br>I told him that were only going to bid on real estate secured loans, not loans secured by retail businesses, equipment leases, etc. Were not going to be a player in any other space but real estate secured loans and Bulk REO.<br><br>I then suggested that he assemble a portfolio of his scratch and dent loans seperate, because we could possibly be interested in saving them the headache and unnecessary hassles of filing the legals and at best case scenario end up with even more negatives on the file which will lower their credit standing with the fed and make the cost of money more expensive for them.<br><br>I will keep you in the loop.        </p>

          Agreed. Get the tape.

          Sal, <br> I am simply just doing what you have taught us to do. I air on the side of caution.  You have taught me that it is important to dot your I&#39;s and cross your T&#39;s.<br><br>You have taught us all that it is extremely important to be direct, to know your deal, know the players and the inner workings of the deal and not the country music love song.<br><br>I am ready to do this, if it is real. I am simply going to provide them with a list of the information we need to see on a excel spreadsheet, and have them assemble the information.<br><br>I am not going to take on the liability of putting together the tape. I always heed your warnings. <br><br>        </p>

          I wouldn&#39;t ask for bios. Call those dogs off. Just get the assets. <br><br>Anyone who works at a bank has probably gone through extensive background checks if they are at the level you&#39;re playing at .        </p>

          James: <br><br>First, good for you for having month end meetings. That is important. <br><br>Second, the answer to your markets question is not a straight forward one. <br><br>On one hand you’re fortunate to live in one of the best pro-business, pro-landlord, pro-investment, fastest growing city in the United States. Everybody loves *urbanized* Texas and Dallas is the crown jewel in the Lone Star State. <br><br>So if you’re looking to syndicate money to buy assets, Dallas is a great place to start. You can attract money by doing that. <br> <br>If you’re crossing trades (Arb’ing) or financing deals (Banking), then no. You should look outside your home state. That is because you’re relying on us to do the due diligence and not yourself as its not your job or responsibility to go hard on costs to do things that must do anyway. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br>This is what you asked me to post about the Philadelphia 170 deal. I really appreciate the time you spent on this deal, going the extra mile for me.<br><br>I have advised the seller that this will more than likely be a pass. He&#39;s asked me to exhaust all sources. I have another outlet but they are going to want me to acquire first then sell to them. Not sure why.<br><br>I was very direct in a non confrontational way and I said I know you have better product, your trying to sling crap my way to see what I can do. He finally said I have a portfolio in a Myrtle Beach, I&#39;m going to send and no one else has it. He was holding up to capitalize on the interest gain until June.<br><br>He said every asset is above $60K, all waterfront properties and he is the owner of these assets and can sign all docs. He said we can cherry pick what we want and the rest he will hold into for income. He said he is not pulling the good stuff for himself, and as I put it, slinging crap.<br><br>Anyway, the new deal came in, all the assets are above $200K in value, so I&#39;m going to take a look at it. A few side notes to clarify a few things.<br><br>This is the same seller that sent me the Canton 68 and the Philly 170, all rough assets. I was told at the beginning that he gets really good stuff all the time. I spent a fair amount of time in conversations with this seller and continually stated all assets must be at $60K in value, and I wanted to be firm with him.<br><br>I don&#39;t make it a practice to rough people up verbally and am not a proponent of it. I don&#39;t want my firm to gain a reputation of being a loopnet type deal clearing house.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve just printed your reply. I&#39;m going to use it. I had to adjust my ways between going from banker to PE. When I was at banker level, I said just send me the deal and I will take a look at it, not realizing what I was setting into motion.<br><br>I got a deal in and I never sent it or told you about it. It was to fund a closed down quarry that the sponsor wanted to convert to a recreational facility where people bungee jumped.<br><br>Zero experience, 3.5 % to put down! zero money to buy equipment! and this deal came in because I said just send it! it took me a lot to not laugh when I said it was a pass.<br><br>I listen to everything you say and I am learning a lot everyday.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I will admit to everyone here that I&#39;m guilty of sending some rough deals over to you, and I was thinking about how this could be a lesson in itself and help those still searching for their first deal.<br><br>What factors come into play that lead to the determination that certain assets are considered rough. Let me clarify for everyone here that rough does not necessarily mean properties that are run down or are in questionable areas.<br><br>This is a question coming more from the financial side such as basis, etc.        </p>

          James<br><br>Very good question again. <br><br>*1. Performing Notes:*<br>*Yield* is what investors want. So this is why they bid down as compared to the face value of the note. The lower the bid, the higher the yield. *Basis* is not so much of an issue with *performing* notes. <br><br>*2. Non-Performing Notes:*<br>Basis. The lower the better. No yield so you’re buying this for control of the asset, not so much yield. And this is a function of costs and time to foreclose. <br><br>*3. REOs*<br>*Basis.* Some folks will tell you that they will pool and say it throws off a cap rate or NOI, but most *sophisticated (aka institutional) investors* will look at the basis only.  If you’re talking to *retail investors* they are less sophisticated and will look at the rental cash flow, which in my opinion isn’t an accurate way to look at this product. <br><br>Keep up the good work. <br>Sal        </p>

          James: <br><br>Why does he use it? <br><br>What does he think you would want to use it for? <br><br>We don’t use this (as the *Buyer*) as we use ClearCapital to do BPOs for us. We need to use objective 3rd parties for these, Google Earth isn’t regularly updated and if a trade goes wrong, we need to hold someone accountable. <br><br>Case in point, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, some homes had notes that were actually – performing. On Google Earth the structure was still standing. <br><br>*But when the BPOs came back, it was under water*. <br><br><br>The Seller (a bank) tried to tell us there was still as structure there. <br><br>As an Intermediary arbitraging these deals, *you should not be looking at Google Earth images as it’s a waste of time, and we’re going to get BPOs anyway.*<br><br>So the only reason he said this was probably because he thought you were a buyer or doesn’t understand how institutional buyers operate in this business. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Ah. Great question. <br><br>*Retail Investors* (aka Ma’s-n-Pa’s) will pay par because they feel as though they are getting a good deal. These are usually the sales pitches from hard money lenders who will sell whole loans or partials to a group of doctors and dentists. The aforementioned doctors and dentists don’t know any better – about seasoning, etc. – and will gladly pay par because they see a face yield of 12-15%. <br><br>Institutional Investors (aka Smarter, More Sophisticated) have higher yield requirements and will pay less for the note to get a higher yield. <br><br>*The lower the price, the higher the yield.* <br><br>*Institutional Investors* also are more sophisticated to buy and bid from banks where the average Retail Investors can’t and won’t.         </p>

          Sal,<br>I may have asked this previously and forgive me I did but don&#39;t remember and am asking again. A gentlemen I have known a long time, has many banking connections. He is a former industrialist that my father in law and I play golf with.<br><br>He is in the as he puts it, the connection business. He called me today and said remember you mentioned your looking to connect directly with banks and I said yes, he said I have 35 bankers right now that I&#39;ve known for years, I can give you their name, phone number and vice-versa and you strike your own deal.<br><br>He said he gets paid by them. He has no say in any deals, doesn&#39;t hand deals off, engineers nothing. If a successful deal is done, they renumerate him.<br><br>Is this considered a broker deal?        </p>

          Sal,<br>After looking at Fulga&#39;s posting about the luxury homes in Colorado, I begun doing a search of pension funds who invested in the ultra high end home development opportunities in Colorado. Why I chose Pension Funds? It just came to mind.<br><br>I was quite surprised to find that the Dallas Police and Fire Fighters Pension Fund that has $9.4 Billion under management, invested $400 Million in a development in Colorado in 2008 and 6 years later, they have a zero ROI and they did this a second time in Arizona with near same results.<br><br>How can we make a play here on something like this? I think we could bring value in some capacity, just not sure how we could.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was approached two days ago to buy a portfolio of 12 multi family properties in Dallas, Texas that needs work and repositioning. It&#39;s a value add opportunity. All twelve properties for $9,500,000.00 being sold by a private seller and it&#39;s off market. It&#39;s has a double digit cap rate.<br><br>Currently it has a NOI of just north iif $440K and a pro forma of just north of $770K but I believe that if repositioned properly, the pro forma NOI could be raised to about $900K.<br><br>I&#39;m going to leverage my intellectual capital into a consulting gig. The real estate broker is doing this for 3% commission because I think they have had a long term relationship. I have not had to do any heavy lifting on this so I&#39;m thinking a flat rate fee of 2 points for bringing an experienced sponsor operator to the table and then orchestrating the funding for the sponsor operator through Dandrew.<br><br>How I want to structure the compensation and the deal is as follows.<br><br>Flat fee commission for locating buyer and creating funding strategy: 2 points<br><br>Funding fee commission: Charge 1 point<br><br>Equity position on the back end:  5 percent.<br><br>Take three of the buildings and create a condo conversion opportunity, creating a selling opportunity for the buyer of the twelve properties where they sell the units and use that money to retire the capital stack. The three properties would be the ones that will generate the least in rental income, even if they are renovated. This would be capitalizing in the highest and best use strategy.<br><br>Any thoughts?<br>        </p>

          Sal, something that comes to mind and this may be an aggressive strategy here, but what about doing a master lease on all 12 properties commingled with a seperate agreement as an option to buy in 12 months. The master lease would require me to manage the deal and pay the lease holder one payment per month. They make what they would anyway in terms of income without the hassles of managing and the expenses. I would hire a management company to do the hands on.<br><br>My thinking is that I can go in, reposition them and get them stabilized. I can prep the condo conversion and since the three are by Baylor Hospital, sell them off to Baylor Hospital who can come in and finish out the conversion to medical condos.<br><br>Use the funds from selling off to the hospital to pull the trigger on the option, complete the acquisition and refinance to pay down any remaining debts and pull some capital out to add to my retirement fund.<br><br>Any thoughts?        </p>

          Hello Sal &amp; AJ,<br>For the first time, someone has entered information on my banker’s website through the PLN page wanting to invest $10,000 for 1 year.  I’ve never had an inquiry through PLN before so I don’t know how to address this with the potential investor.  Please advise.  Thanks for all the help and education.  <br>        </p>

          Dave, <br><br>This is great. However, $10,000 isn’t enough to do *anything* with. But you should keep in in mind for when larger deals come down, you can patch together his $10,000 with others. <br><br>I just want you to make bigger money, that’s all! But I guess you have seen for yourself that the <br>www.PrivateBankerIdentityKit.com *works*.  <br><br>This is good news for you, your business and your overall confidence. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>To me it looks like the PLN portion is to combine capital from various retail investors to ultimately use for syndication for a particular commercial deal.  If this is correct, I’d ask what’s the best utilization of the site as far as marketing to find investors,  how to find choice properties to syndicate, &amp; how to respond to investors that say they want to invest a particular amount like the couple that filled out the form on my site - $10,000 for 1 year.   To me it’s the chicken or the egg – find a property &amp; then market the PLN, or market the PLN to find investors and then find a property.    Or, I may be way off base here.  <br><br>        </p>

          Dave<br><br>There are many ways you can generate revenue from this. And, because I am your mentor, I will tell you *the #1 mistake that all investors make is to find a deal first*, and then scramble to find investors. That is a 1st Class ticket to frustration, broken dreams and discouragement. <br><br>The reason why we can do even more deal types than we care to advertise is because I have relationship with investors that are “axed” for certain deal types and if they fit, the get closed. <br><br>So this is a resource that you should continue to keep in touch with, cultivate, build and then utilize these investors any one of these ways: <br><br>1.  Place them into someone else’s deal if you don’t have one. If you are a Hard Money Financier, we call this “brokering” and if you make 5 points on 100,000 that’s $5,000 (5 points on 10,000 is enough to buy a nice pair of shoes for your wife, but still, there is value here if you keep building the list). <br><br>2.  Sell the lead to Hard Money Lender(s). Yes, you can sell the lead more than 1x. As long as you disclose this. $50 for the name, $100 to take it off the market altogether so its exclusive (and make sure you hold to your word that you’re selling this exclusively otherwise, like they say, building trust is like a skyscraper, takes years to build, seconds to bring down). <br><br>3.  Place them into your own deals. If you are a Capital Syndicator, then you bank these names, send them your “What is a Syndication” Pitchbook, then when the deal comes, send them your “Deal Level” Pitchbook. <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br>I just got something that could be a deal and I will give you a brief overview. 12 Notes in California, all performing, all assets except one is above $60,000.00. The one that is below $60K is a busted Heloc, asset value dropped to $18K, payments being made to bankruptcy trustee outside of plan but is current.<br><br>Pricing expectation is 93% of UPB but I think we could get them down, I&#39;m not sending anything more on this to you until I get at the inner workings of the deal to see where they really are at.<br><br>Is this of interest to you?        </p>

          I will send the tape. I spent some time on this after dinner. Here is the figures.<br><br>Original Balances: $3,315,900.00<br>Current Balances:$ 2,179,212.00<br>Asset values (Through Appraisal) $7,326,000.00<br><br>I verified that this is direct from the seller, which is an investment corporation. They stated, we have all files and docs, can ready them for DD immediately.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting for the monthly payment amounts so we can get an idea if the cash flow figures. I will send the tape once I get these.  If you would like to bid on the sub $60K I&#39;m certain they would love to get rid of it. I don&#39;t really think they would mind selling 11 of 12 loans at one shot.        </p>

          2 questions, please.. I put it here because it didn&#39;t seem to fit the other categories...<br><br>1.  Regarding the Credibility Kit.. I already have a Marketing Services LLC; do I need &gt;to get another separate LLC for Camellia Capital Funding (the name I selected for this business), or can I make it a Camellia Capital Funding, a division of Ken Fong Marketing Services, LLC (or a dba).  I need to select the &quot;proper&quot; name for my business for the credibility kit; <br><br>2.  Can I use my UPS Store address as the business address, and not my home address?  I work out of my home.<br>        </p>

          Ken,<br><br>1.  No. Just keep it as Camellia Capital Funding. <br>Do *NOT* put on there “…a division of Ken Fong Marketing Services, LLC”. <br><br>2.  Yes, use the UPS Store Address. That is fine. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Just to be clear, you are saying I can use Camellia Capital Funding for the Credibility Kit, and not need to create a separate LLC for it?  Do I need to register the business name with the city (i.e.Doing Business As)? (and separate bank account?)  Just trying to figure out how do I do business under Camellia Capital Funding, and process checks from Dandrews. I guess you would/could send checks to me make out to me and not Camellia Capital Funding.. <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Ken        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am aware that Dandrew buys loan pools and loans that are performing. You have also indicated twice in recent times that banks don&#39;t really have an incentive to liquidate these types of assets because the status if the loans are obviously current.<br>I have a bank in Fort Worth Texas they may want to liquidate some of these, what are the risks in buying these outside of the potential to no longer be performing. Also when you look at the risk, does the question ever come into play of, does the bank know something they are not sharing and when your scoring the pool do you give the pool a lower score to offset this potential key event?        </p>

          James: <br><br>First, this is not a *“key event”*. A key event is the event in commercial value-added deals that must happen for the deal to be a success. For example, a large NNN tenant signed on to a retail center. That is what the exit strategy is contingent upon. <br><br>Regarding the Texas maybe-soon-to-be-probably-will-be defaults, the largest function of pricing these are *costs required and time to foreclose*. <br><br>I think I answered this or something similar to these, but in Texas, and we love Texas, you can lasso their asses out in 21 days for non payment. If you have an attorney who is good. <br><br>So just keep that in mind. And now’s the time for this guys to move balance sheet because the longer it goes, the deeper the discount…<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>There are many of the PE&#39;s here that may not know that funds operate on a 2 and 20. This is as you and I know, 2% of fees and 20% of returns generated, both going to the fund for compensation, but could you elaborate if this is the industry standard or are there sometimes variations in this compensation formula?        </p>

          James<br><br>This is a great question<br><br>In the “JV Equity vs. Fund Structures” module, I discuss that not all investors pay rack rate. <br><br>For example, some investors pay less and some pay more. And the best analogy I can make is like buying an airline ticket to Las Vegas. <br><br>Let’s assume that all folks will fly coach coming to my event in Las Vegas from the same city. <br><br>The person in front of you will pay more than you did. The person next to you may pay less. <br><br>If Warren Buffet invested in my fund, he would want “0% &amp; 0%”; meaning he wouldn’t pay any fees or splits. But I would get to tell the world that Warren Buffet was an investor in my fund, which would bring more people in who would pay 2/20. <br><br>Sal<br><br><br>        </p>

          Aspen CO: Land at Ski Lodge, base of ski resort (“ski in/ski out/ 14 luxury properties”)<br><br>Everything about this deal is LOCATION: 3.5 square miles land at the famous Aspen CO ski lodge. The last piece of land in this area has recently become available and it is located at the base of the ski resort.<br>Sponsor wants to acquire the land and build 14 luxury homes, about 6,000 SqFt each.  After years of heavy fight with the building department (very difficult to get permits in that area), permits have been obtained.  The land is appraised at $38 mil, and the gross revenue estimated at about $200 mil. <br><br>Sponsor needs a JV to buy the land, with 100% financing, and in turn he is willing to provide equity as per lender’s terms. Once the land is purchased, sponsor will have no issue to raise the capital for construction. Developer Bio /Proforma will be provided if there is interest in this type of JV (100% financing with equity as per lender’s terms).<br>Here are the figures:<br>• Land acquisition: $35,000,000<br>• Total projected building cost: $68,162,600.00<br>• Total projected development cost: $103,162,600.00<br>• Projected sales price: $2,500.00 per square feet or $13,800,000.00 per home<br>• Total sales revenue: : $193,200,000.00<br>• Net: $72,649,000.00<br>• ROI: 70% or $50,854,580.00<br><br>Is Dandrew interested in this type of JV?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Fulga, why don&#39;t you become the JV Partner yourself? Use your intellectual capital to leverage your skill sets to captain the deal. Your intellectual capital has a value just as goodwill has a value in a business sale. Anyone can get a JV Partner who sits around like a puppet and brings no real value, how many people get a JV Partner who actually can do what you do, I do, etc.<br><br>Provide your services as a consultant in the deal, handling the heavy lifting for an equity piece on the back end. Prep the financial package for a $5,000.00 fee paid upfront.<br><br>Think you can&#39;t do it? don&#39;t forget, you have Sal to answer your questions here.         </p>

          Fulga,<br>Call Cooley LLP in Broomfield, Colorado at 720 566-4000, tell them you have this deal that needs a JV Partner in a Ski Resort. They are a law firm that has clients that are extremely wealthy, some I believe are motion picture actors and actresses, pro athletes, Fortune 500 CEO&#39;s who invest as passive investors and Cooley provides the legal in the deal.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Since this event in Las Vegas is going to be your last, I think I speak for those that are not going when I say, we wish you were not stopping, but some times its better to leave while on top.<br><br>I can only imagine what this event is going to cost you. have you given any thought into doing a live streaming type of preview and charge about $195.00 per person to attend , sort of like pay per view.<br><br>At $195.00, they get to attend live but from their living room or office, etc., video of the sessions after they attend, etc.<br>If you got 2500 people @ 195.00 each, you would gross $487,500.00, probably enough to cover your costs.<br><br>I was thinking about this as a suggestion.        </p>

          Hi,<br>During the call this morning, AJ suggested I contact &quot;Ask Andrew&quot; with my question.<br>So...I&#39;m a commercial mortgage broker in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have provided several loans for a developer client during the past 6 months.  They buy small commercial properties - ranging from $1 million to $5 million (industrial, mobile home parks, residential development and flex office in Northern California) that need some improvements, entitlements, or other value add.  At the completion of the work they flip the properties and make a nice profit.  <br>They don&#39;t have deep pockets and have been bringing in outside investors with whom they have a professional acquaintance for equity on their deals - they typically property at 50%, with 50% equity.  Those investors are starting to get a little &quot;bitchy&quot; by throwing their weight around in an unproductive (and unprofessional) way.  The result is clients want to bring in new investors to fund their deals, and they asked me to lead that effort for them.<br>On the call this morning I asked AJ for some guidance on how to price my services to these developers, in terms of points and equity interest I should receive as compensation for bringing them new equity investors.  AJ drew a blank on the question and suggested I might need to buy another product, and that you could better advise me.<br>Can you suggest how to price the deals I&#39;m asking about or (more likely), do you have suggestions about a product that could help me with my pricing dilemma?<br>Also, I was out of town (in Iowa) from last Friday until Tuesday night (with no regular internet access) and didn&#39;t see the scripts offered in Sal&#39;s email on Sunday.  I saw Sal&#39;s email Wednesday morning, but it was too late to download the scripts.  I also saw they would be offered later for $97.00, so can I buy those scripts?<br>Thank you.<br>Dennis<br>        </p>

          Dennis: <br><br>Retail investors are – as a rule – a huge pain in the ass. They don’t understand markets, deals and like to pretend they are the big man/woman on campus. <br><br>If they have a business plan, which during this preliminary point all I would need to see is their: <br><br>1.  *Bios.*<br>Who they are and what they do. Resumes, etc. <br><br>2.  *Deal Sheet.*<br>A list of deals they’ve done. Includes: deal name, asset type, basis they bought at, basis they exited out, return to investors; <br><br>Then that would be enough to see if they qualify for a JV Equity Facility. Meaning they have a checkbook that requires 2 signatures (ours and their’s…)<br><br>Review your Private Equiteer training (JV vs Fund Structures) for more info on this. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;ve invested in a few Dandrew products - DIP Financing, Hooked on Overages, Capital Syndicator, Mezz Financing &amp; Pref. Equity, Arbitrageur, and recently bought your Briefcase.  But I&#39;m not a Private Equiteer (unless it&#39;s known by a different name), and don&#39;t see anything in what I have that&#39;s called &quot;JV Equity vs. Fund Structures&quot;.  I&#39;ll be the first to say I may well be missing something.  Where can I find the info on Private Equiteer or &quot;JV Equity vs. Fund Structures&quot;?<br>As I wrote the various products (above), it occurred to me that you could probably suggest the order in which I study them.  I would appreciate your help with that also.<br>Thanks.<br>Dennis        </p>

          Hi Sal...What&#39;s the sentiment that a seller of a note should have if they have a 12% note selling it at 8%.  I&#39;m concerned that the buyer would see the original 12% yield and feel like they are being robbed.  How should I handle this?  Thanks, Hurol        </p>

          I asked this question because I know a source for 12% interest NOO loans and the idea I had was to sell it off to retail investors at 8% interest yield...Is this above board? I ran some quick numbers on it and the gains are substantial ( I will have to go back though and check the ltv&#39;s)        </p>

          Yes. You can do this. Of course. it hasppens all day long. Just the more savvy and sophisticated investor won&#39;t buy into these. <br><br>But the guy who desperately wants 8% *desperately* will buy these all day long. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hurol,<br>I started in this business brokering note trades. As long as your fee is not out of the ordinary, you should not meet with resistance. Case in point, on a $50,000.00 note your not going to be fair in charging more than 1 to 1.5 points.<br><br>Don&#39;t fall victim to what these note courses tell you to charge, they are not realistic.        </p>

          Rick,<br>My brother used these guys. They are reasonable compared to others and I believe it was like $99.00 upfront and you pay in installments. They run your credit immediately so they have up to the minute data. If your client would have issues with another inquiry in their credit report, he probably won&#39;t use them.<br><br>Definitely worth it.        </p>

          Sal<br><br>Would it be possible to get some business references from past banks that Dandrew have closed portfolios with, along with say purchasing history of say the past 3 years or so of distressed assets purchases (Bulk REO &amp; NPL) and these would greatly help while we wait for the proof of funds to be sorted out.  I haven&#39;t had any banks ask me for POF yet, but I think a company profile including some references from past deals from our funding source would be greatly beneficial. <br><br> I have gotten some interest from lenders but they are very slow to move and I really want to make the best impression possible, as some are telling me stories of bad experiences from flaky companies and are now very hesitant.,  and now want additional information from past buying experience.<br><br>It could be something along the lines of a document saying that  Dandrew purchased X amount of non performing paper last quarter / year  and is looking to spend Y amount for the next quarter / year .  In addition to saying something along the lines that last year we closed on deals with such and such a bank.  Something a long the lines of what was included in the DIP autoresponder scripts message # 1, but a little bit more detailed and relevant to the Bulk REO/ Arbitrage side of the business.  <br><br>Rudy Richard        </p>

          sal,<br>I just watched the MHP deal in one of the looking over your shoulder training. I live in mobile home parkville. In North Texas, this is huge business and some of these parks are 200 to 500 pads, just mammoth in scope.<br><br>I am willing to bet for the right price, these could be purchased at attractive prices. Are you still entertaining these types of deals? what is your exact criteria as far as # pads, desired NOI, crietria for owned vs. rented, if owned and park is collecting lot rent, what is the minimum lot rent that makes it attractive, is self managed more attractive or is professional management more attractive, yes/no on seller financing.<br><br>I am always looking for deals and there are certainly deals in this asset class, here and I agree, they are cash cows and really a wave of the future.        </p>

          Sal, <br>I am learning the importance of not only qualifying the deal but the players as well. I&#39;ve concluded you can have the best deal but if you have players in the deal that don&#39;t bring value, the whole deal loses value.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is where I&#39;m at on this deal, what I have uncovered. It&#39;s a 55 plus mobile park community. 5 star level property with room to expand. Property is at 137 acres. No rent control and well established. On lake, all double wides. Stable cash flow w/ no distress. Lot rents are $382, $390, $409, $437 and $483 depending on lot location in park. Park uses 37 acres of the 137 acres. 100 additional acres for expansion or development.<br><br>2013 year end P&amp;L was Gross Income from all sources of $1,291,422.56 Total net operating income was $723,210.83.<br><br>This has an assumable loan on it. They are asking $14,000,000.00, however I believe that with the economy still in its current condition, the fact that there are not too many buyers, I believe there is a play here.<br><br>The strategy I think to make a play is to acquire the property net of the assumable loan. You obtain an appraisal or BPO on the 100 acres and do a joint venture with a developer. Depending upon the permissible use of this 100 acres, you sell off the 100 acres to the developer or a buyer.<br><br>The value in this deal I think is if you take the value of the park and the value of the 100 acres and add it together, and you back out the cost to acquire, you can make a sizable profit. I believe there could be an opportunity to a DPO on the assumable loan and add that debt service costs back into the Income of the property.<br><br>Now for the risk. The risk is that the seller may be asking too many times EBITA to make this worthwhile even with the income, NOI, the additional acreage. They may have invested too much money into the property and are trying to get that back out.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting in the first qtr 2014 numbers to see if there have been any dramatic changes in the numbers, too see if there have been any rent increases and as a result, a potential vacancy increase.<br><br>I&#39;m also going to contact the zoning board to see what the 100 acres is zoned for and to get an idea of what is happening in the area to see if this becomes a big box retailing growth area.<br><br>If big boxes are coming and the zoning permits for it or can be changed for it, there is significant upside in selling the 100 acres to one of those guys.<br><br>I will keep you posted.        </p>

          What if we did this deal structured in the following way. $10,000,000.00 cash to close now, $3,000.000.00 deferred for 18 months and we bring in a big box retailer to buy the 100 acres. We sell each acre at $85,000.00 per acre or $8,500,000.00. $3,000,000.00 deducted from sale proceeds leaves $5,500,000.00. Deduct this figure from the $13,000,000.00 paid and your in at a basis of $7,500,000.00.<br><br>We JV on this, I come in and manage this project hands on earning my back end equity piece from sweat equity.        </p>

          How about structuring it as follows...<br><br>Purchase price: $13,000,000.00 with $10,000,000.00 cash paid at closing<br>Assumable Loan: We assume this debt<br>Land placed into a LLC and we setup a equity share arrangement. We sell the LLC for $8,700,000.00 and we give the seller of the park, $1,000,000.00 from these proceeds.<br><br>The seller receives $11,000,000.00 total from the sale, which is equivalent to have received all cash anyway. <br><br>Out of the $7,700,000.00 balance, we do a DPO on the assumable loan, offering $500,000.00 for the debt and retiring it.<br><br>Of course the deal is contingent upon the values of both the park and the land proving out. I would go to California on a weekly basis and manage the deal and carry out all the initiatives to make the deal go as planned.        </p>

          Yes. We ignore these. Why? <br><br>Because these folks are looking to merely list their assets to have unsophisticated and inexperienced investors jump in and do all the brain damage of pricing these assets – only to say, “thanks, but no thanks”. <br><br>So, don’t be a sucker. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I got an email request that falls somewhat in a gray area so I&#39;m asking if we can do this. Its sort of grocery anchored, with NOI in line with the loan amount requested. If it was a string of dog kennels I would know the answer. But its borderline, so should I pursue this or decline:  <br><br>I&#39;m looking for $5 mil loan to purchase a package deal of 3 superamerica gas stations c/stores w/liquor franchises chain in Minnesota. The acquisition includes businesses with real estate.<br>The yearly gross revenue is $25 mil.<br>The net is $1.2 mil a year. after all the operating expenses, fees, the mortgages, the taxes and the pay roll are paid.<br>The market value of the businesses and the real estate is $7.5 mil<br>The stations can sale easily for $2.5 mil each.<br>I have 25 years experience in this Industry. I worked for oil companies managing the retail divisions. I also owned and operated similar businesses.<br>Our objective is to expand ,acquire more gas stations ,become a jobber ,sale fuel to other gas stations and dealers.<br>The loan will go directly to the seller(Oil company) to purchase this chain of gas stations.<br>Because of my Extensive Experience in this Industry The Oil company will put 20% for the down payment.<br>The Deal can be done one Gas station c/store at the time or the entire chain at once.<br>If you think you have the capability or what it takes to get me the other 80% of the Loan Contact me.        </p>

          I have a capital provider for these. Email me at structuredcommcap@gmail.com, the following:<br><br>State they are located in, Gross revenues, Net income, these need to include all sources such as c-store, fuel, car wash, etc.<br><br>Are year to date financials available and have they been audited, if yes, when. What is the value of the real estate and what is the capital stack. What is the value of the business seperate from the real estate.<br><br>What is the lease arrangement with the franchise and what is the franchise agreement in terms of royalties, having to use one supplier, How many years is the lease for.<br><br>How many gallons of fuel is pumped on a daily basis. Has a environmental study been done, what is the age of the tanks. Has a traffic study been done by the borrower. Why is this important? because the gas station businesses success is predicated upon traffic flow. How many other gas stations in the area.<br><br>What is the story of the deal?

          Sal, <br>I recently had a visit to  my offices from a gentleman I once had a deal going with in Austin that Peter turned down. The deal was for a student housing project at University of Texas that turned into a development deal and it was not doable.<br><br>He asked me if we are still in the same boat of not funding student housing and I told him yes, we are not in the business of ground up development. He said look, we are ourselves now in a position of having to locate properties already built that are dated, acquiring these and out of our own resources, funding the rehab/conversion but we may be needing funding to acquire.<br><br>I informed him that we would enjoy working with him and his firm on this. he asked about fees and points and  I quoted him 65 to 70% first, remainder to be hard cash equity that is seasoned and verifiable. I told him that if he wanted to cross colllateralize with another asset that is free and clear, he can pledge that. I quoted him 12 to 14% interest, interest only, 1 to 3 year term, 1 to 3 points.<br><br>He asked if they can buy down the interest and I said we can discuss this once we have a live deal in front of us. I told him that I need a bio of all the principals including himself and a brief overview of the project, time frame for needing the funds, exact sources and uses, where their equity is coming from, and a deal sheet of previous student housing projects they have completed and who they have funded through in the past. I also provided a list of the five data points obviously without Dandrews identity listed.<br><br>He told me that they dislike their previous funders and are looking to establish a new source. I told him to get all this together and we will work the deal at that time.<br><br>Any additional information you need to see?        </p>

          On the previous go around, the deal was a ground up development deal. I wanted to be firm and let him know that if he wants to send deals where they want ground up monies, were not in that space. <br><br>If they have projects where they can acquire a property such as a multi family and convert it then send it. I find that  sometimes I just have to be firm. I have no interest in wasting Dandrew&#39;s time.        </p>

          Here is what they want to do. They want to acquire multi family properties that are available as a REO or in some level of near vacancy, acquire them, rehab them, using their own resources and then market them as student housing properties that are upscale.<br><br>They will charge a monthly rent on a per room basis. They are offering to possibly pay the first six months of debt service immediately after closing, so they get ahead of the game.         </p>

          Sal,<br>This just came over this morning. It&#39;s a tape I received an overview email on. It&#39;s a tape of loans. <br><br>Portfolio UPB: $3.4 M<br>Total # Assets: 89<br>Average Loan Size: $41,549.00<br>Interest Rate Weighed Average: 9.7%<br>Lien Position: First Position across entire pool<br>Collateral locations: Nationwide<br>Collateral Type: Residential 1-4 Family.<br><br>I took a page from your strategies on the Bulk Live Videos, which is to get a overview first, then if it&#39;s worth a looksie, then get the tape.<br><br>Here&#39;s where I think the play is at. It&#39;s all firsts, residential, small portfolio but still above the minimum $2M. The loan balances are not very high which signals a potential to be closed out fairly soon. There is the potential to get the loan refinanced to buy us out and there is a potential to offer a DPO to the payor. Are these viable impressions?<br><br>The one concern I have is the loan size of $41,549.00. The risk is that the property values will be low and that&#39;s why the average loan is what it is.<br><br>Once I get the tape, should I send it?        </p>

          Sal, a little clarification please regarding DIP. I am looking at Chap 11 on Pacer.gov and going to the individual cases. Open the attorney list and see the list of &#39;creditors and attorneys&#39; and &#39;debtor and attorneys&#39;. Sometimes under the listing for the debtor it will be &#39;debtor in possession&#39;. Does this mean that a DIP is already working?        </p>

          Sal,<br>One of the opportunities you&#39;ve helped a lot of us get into is the consulting business. The intellectual capital you&#39;ve provided has been tremendous in getting us in the door.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen a few here mention this a few times. My business has evolved more into that of a consultancy, really just on its own. It&#39;s been exciting, it&#39;s been challenging and I&#39;ve been documenting everything I&#39;ve been doing.<br><br>My struggle has been in pricing my services where I&#39;m getting fairly compensated for my work. I&#39;ve come up with a formula. Please provide some insight.<br><br>First, I have my exploratory call and client analysis. I&#39;m charging $500.00 for this, paid up front. This is a 1 hour job. I&#39;m essentially getting to know my client, what they want to accomplish, what they have done, their strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Next I have what I call financial tooling and re-tooling. This starts at $1500.00 paid up front and once this three hour time is exhausted, it&#39;s $250.00 per hour after. This is where I look at the deals they are doing, look at revenues, costs, losses, etc. I have an accounting degree, so this is stuff I know.<br><br>Next I have my Next Level Session. This is where we look at how they take a project to the Next Level. This is business, marketing and day to day operational plans. Did they source out funds yet, what did they say, did they put their best foot forward. We look at their chosen capital provider, can that provider actually fund their project, etc. This fee will be be $5000.00 with $2500.00 paid upfront, remainder 15 days later.<br><br>Now we move to Operation Deal. This is where we put together the five data points, the pitch book, marketing materials, financials, strategy for structuring the deal, put together the team which consists of financial, legal, compliance, brokerage, and others and we move forward.<br><br>I&#39;m charging  $10K for the pitch book alone and $15,000.00 for the remainder and of course im looking to craft in a equity piece if the project can support it.<br><br>My question is, am I charging too much, am I missing something?        </p>

          Three quick Loopnet related questions: <br>1.I was asked by a broker I contacted through Loop net whether we do HUD loans or just cmbs. Any suggestions as to a response?<br>2. Since we are sourcing for acquiring property, what data points should we request from the broker, other than length of the remaining term the owner is willing to finance?<br>3. What is our exit strategy for these acquisitions?<br><br> Thanks again for the infographic.        </p>

          David: <br><br>1.  What do you mean “do”? We don’t offer HUD loans or CMBS loans. <br>*Please be specific.* <br><br>2.  5 Data Points. Then place here and let me do the rest. <br><br>3.  Exit Strategy. I have no idea. This is for you to buy, not us. We don’t buy anything. <br><br>Folks: this strategy was to show more experienced and aggressive Intermediaries how to acquire commercial property without using their own credit or money. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, thank you. I spoke with the sponsor today and rescheduled for 9am Pacific time in the morning to do some research. I have been going through all the webinars and training from everything you sent me and trying to run my business from what you taught me. The DIP financing portion is part of my website and I don&#39;t have the funds right now to get what I need to know for the morning. Eventually I will get it. This deal is probably way out of my league but what can I do in the meantime to get prepared?         </p>

          Hi Sal, I have a general question about hard money lenders. I heard your guest speaker Byran Kern on the arbitrage live  video, are hard money lenders affiliated with banks or no, they use private investors money. Thanks, Dexter        </p>

          Dexter: <br><br>No. Hard money lenders are not affiliated with banks. But sometimes hard money lenders get what’s called “*credit facilities*” from other banks. This is adding leverage to what they have. <br><br>For example, if a hard money lender has $5mm raised in investor equity, he can get a loan for an additional $5mm (or in good times $10mm). <br>So now for $5mm, he’s making points and fees and interest income on $10mm. What a wonderful country, right? <br><br>Except leverage can destroy you if you don’t know what you’re doing. And I’m here to tell you, Dexter, that many hard money lenders screw up operationally, and then blow up. <br><br>So, then if you’re thinking like your pal Sal, you go to the bank, offer $4mm for the defaulted loan secured against the $10mm portfolio, and foreclose and get $10mm worth of assets for…. You guessed it! $4mm. So we would add $6mm to our net worth because we leverage our brains. <br><br>Now, that’s what you call Grave Dancing. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I had a call today from a broker who actually put me onto a call with a seller. The first question I asked is are you the legal owner of the assets and do you house the files at your office or through a storage facility.<br><br>Most brokers don&#39;t even know what a storage facility is and what the significance of theses are. I was on the phone with the seller and I&#39;m getting the tape. The broker on this deal is his attorney who has a lot of expertise with note dispositions and trades.<br><br>Anyway, the broker said that he would like to partner with my firm on deals. He realizes just how funds dislike broker deals. His idea is he will locate the deals and screen the sellers and I bring the buyers to the deal and we split fees 50/50 after expenses.<br><br>I informed him that my capital provider and fund does not entertain broker deals and he said he meets with this resistance everywhere that he connects with real sellers.<br><br>My question I am guessing would be since deals would be coming from my firm technically and my partner and I are splitting the fees and points, would this in Dandrew&#39;s view still be a broker deal?        </p>

          James. <br><br>when we send you your incentives, anything you promised the other broker or 3rd party comes out of those proceeds. Not ours. <br><br>So if we send you a wire at close for 40K, its your responsibility to pay your referrals from that pool of 40K. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Dan, <br><br>This refers to Self Storage Facilities. These are really just cement slabs with steel doors that hoarders use to store their crap in for a monthly fee. <br><br>These were also over build duing the late 2000s when every doctor and accountant wanted to become a “developer”. So there is a supply and demand issue. Too much supply. Not enough demand. So the price goes down. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>He has experience flipping low-balance homes, not being a developer.

          Real Estate Investing Conference New York City April 24:<br><br>Sal, I did attend today the NY City investor conference as an Exhibitor, and I had the opportunity to give my 2 min “Elevator Speech” (I was waiting for your help on that…I think you have forgotten about me); I was really impressed meeting investors who came not only from US, but from Europe, and Asia, just for this event! <br><br>The funny part of my NY city adventure was trying to sell my financial services to Ziel Feldman, the founder of HFZ Capital Group, who purchased the notes securing 303 East 51st Street, 20 West 40th Street, The Setai at Wall Street (40 Broad Street) and One Madison Avenue, as well as properties located at 11 East 68th Street and 11 Beach Street, all located in New York City. I did not know about him and his investing portfolios when I explained my Mezzanine $2 mil-$10 mil loans…but I had a very good laugh afterwards. <br><br>The interesting part to share with you is that the CEO of a capital creation company was looking for Equity Partners for a sky rise building in NY City. I told him that I was interested, and we exchanged business cards…more to come<br>        </p>

          Sal, I do take your concerns seriously. Although I feel pretty strong in analyzing commercial real estate deals, I am pretty weak in JV because I am a beginner in this area. As I said before I have many JV deals, and that’s why I need your help in guiding me here. Before I call the sponsor to ask the hard questions, I need to know what these questions would be, so thank you for clarifying that.<br><br>I was also sure that this was a Purchase JV, not a construction one, since the sponsor is using somebody else to pay for the construction expense; so as you see…it’s a learning curve. <br><br>I will get all the info you requested, but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s fair to use your time if you cannot benefit from this deal, but all you want is to help me, which is greatly appreciated. <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on the medical project I am doing the capital raise for, it is really getting exciting and it really has taught me a lot.<br><br>We met with the owner of the subject acquisition property and we presented our offer of seller financing, ten years, 10% simple interest with one payment per year of $50,000.00 plus the interest.<br><br>He asked what we are going to do with the property and my wife said we need you to sign a confidentiality agreement first and he signed it. He is a retired medical doctor, so we did not want to lift our skirt first.<br><br>He came back with the following. He said that he likes the project a lot. He said why don&#39;t I give the property to you, since I own it free and clear and I have no real use for it and to get a buyer outside of us would take awhile.<br><br>He proposed that in exchange for the property, he gets a 15% equity stake in the entire project. He said he will make more money over the long term than selling the property outright and from a tax standpoint, this makes sense.<br><br>I will keep you posted as we go on.        </p>

          I&#39;m boosting my marketing by offering a 100% financing product to &quot;professional&quot; commercial real estate clients of real estate attorneys.  The offering will consist of part debt (whether it&#39;s existing or fresh)  and part equity (whether it&#39;s through capital raise or Dandrew).  Basically get one or the other from Dandrew - debt or equity that is- and get the remainder through a raise...but I had to sweeten the deal this way so I&#39;ll have the &quot;he who hold the gold makes the rules&quot; type leverage....basically this offer is to make up for my light experience but heavy intellectual capital.<br><br>-Hurol        </p>

          Huron,<br>Why would you offer 100% financing? Where is their skin in the game? being experienced is never going to take the place of having skin in the game.<br><br>Also are you going to amortize the loan over a long term with a balloon payment due in a shorter period of time? also if your going to do a capital raise, how will you structure the deal? what&#39;s in it for the equity investors?<br><br>How long are you going to keep the investors money tied up and how are you going to get it back to them? what if the investors want preferred equity? what if you need to do a capital call and the investors say no. What if the deal goes South, how will everyone be protected. Is all this capital going to over leverage the deal?<br><br>The risk you take is that a funder that will be in first position will ask where is the sponsor-operators equity going to come from? a lender may say that if the sponsor-operator uses funds from a capital raise, that those monies are not equity from their own resources.<br><br>If I were structuring this, I would do a complete capital raise for the entire investment and create a joint venture structure where the equity investors get their money back plus a negotiated % of profits or ROI and the principal sponsor-operator gets the income plus tax benefits.<br><br>        </p>

          To the above intermediary.  I agree with what your saying.  If I&#39;m not mistaken having debt along with equity doesn&#39;t stop the equity holder from enacting remedies for non-performance as well as rewarding the sponsor for exceptional performance; there will be hurdles which have to be met.  Like Sal said this is knowledge of the lawyers, so they will be more versed in protecting the equity and the project.<br><br>For Sal, I guess at times I get stuck in analysis paralysis.  Ever since I heard you use the term &quot;Structure away the risk&quot;,  it is something that I have tattooed in the way I think.  And no, I&#39;m not putting together docs or papering deals; I&#39;m just hashing out talking point - sort of like and LOI.  Something like a verbal agreement before I bring it to you guys; basically setting expectations...(is this something you could help me with)?        </p>

          That is fine. You need to have these discussions *before* you speak to the attorneys. Otherwise they will charge you for “discovery”. Meaning, you’re paying to be the R&amp;D department on your own deal! <br><br>Structure the verbal agreement, place it here, and I’ll make changes as needed. <br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          Hurol,<br>I like the concept of offering 100% financing, not too many are doing this today. Let&#39;s look at the capital raise for a moment. Your asking investors to place funds in the deal and yes I agree, with the right docs drafted by the right attorneys, the investors can be protected and at the end of the day, that&#39;s where you need to place your concern.<br><br>Now if I&#39;m an investor and your pitching me on this deal, the first thing I&#39;m going to ask is how much skin in the game are the sponsor operators putting in. Why am I asking this? Two reasons.<br><br>1) Because I&#39;m looking to limit my exposure 2) I&#39;m looking for a reason (s) to say no. I&#39;m looking at the risks. Investors are always looking at the risks first, the rewards second because just one risk proving out can dilute my entire investment.<br><br>Next, I&#39;m going to ask, what happens if the sponsor operator causes the property to end up in foreclosure, am I going to have to get into a capital call just to save the property from foreclosure and protect my interest.<br><br>Next concern is how am I going to feel about sharing the stage with a lender? In a foreclosure action, most lenders will escalate the interest on the loan to the highest rate allowed by law, so if the loan starts out at 10% and the need to escalate comes about and the maximum in your state is 21%, were all in trouble. The lender isn&#39;t going to care about the investors.<br><br>Next I&#39;m going to focus upon you. Your setting up all of this. What experience do you have in this? do you understand what fiduciary duty really entails, how are you being compensated. You mentioned the concept of who has the gold calls the shots, well unfortunately, its the investors with the gold, so they will probably call the shots.<br><br>Like I said, I like it however, I would structure this as a joint venture, saying to the sponsor operator, you line up the funding first and my fund will invest the remainder. Your fund will be one you create and manage.<br><br>I know I sound like a james downer, I&#39;ve learned to think like this because this is how Sal has conditioned me to think.        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I just received an email from a private lender I know, has been in the business for a long time and is quite diligent about his work.  I wanted to share with you his lesson learned and to any others here that lend their own money.<br><br>&quot;A scary thing happened to me 8 months ago.<br>Lent $2.2mil on 2 apartment buildings, at 60% LTV, 11%, 2 points, 1 year, 3 mo prepaid interest.  A great loan, I thought.<br>After 3 months were up, interest payments did not come in.<br>Contacted the borrower, no response.<br>Went to the building, searched for manager.  <br>The manager told me these were fraudulently obtained loans.<br>WOW, I could feel the cold sweat on the back of my neck.<br>The real owner filed a police report.  Detectives interviewed me.<br>I kept thinking, &quot;what about my 2.2mil&quot;?<br>Contacted the title insurance company at once.<br>Took them 5 months to investigate.<br>It was scary, even I knew all along that I had title insurance.<br>Finally, last week, I got paid off by the title company, a great sigh of relief.<br>Got my own money back, but it certainly felt like wining the lotto.<br>I hear fraudulently obtained loans are plenty out there.   Watch out.  Especially if you are lending on a free and clear property.<br>Double check everything, I had, but I still fell victim.<br>There are gangs out there, searching for free/clear props.  Forging all owners&#39; info, id, and they are very good at it.<br>Signatures match, ids match, title company is fooled, etc etc.&quot;<br><br>Chris<br>        </p>

          Deric<br><br>*Great question.*<br><br>I would say that the honest answer is that we should be placing some of these closed deals (either with Dandrew Intermediaries or without Dandrew Intermediaries) somewhere in a members section for case studies for members to reference. <br><br>This way, these can be referenced for our Intermediaries. <br><br>In the meantime, tell him the average trades are 5mm in value, nationwide from smaller regionals looking to move balance sheet. <br><br>Gordon and I will put our heads together. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have been working for about a month now with a very experienced buying entity out of Newport Beach, California that has been buying seconds from banks for about seven years now. I think I mentioned them in another post.<br><br>I was thinking about presenting the idea of a credit facility to them through Dandrew. Would this be of interest to Dandrew? they want to do business by selling to us the seconds they choose to sell each month. <br><br>I&#39;m thinking a credit facility would be of great interest to them.        </p>

          James<br><br>Not for seconds. No. Nobody wants to provide debt (or equity) in this space as they are too small (in aggregate volume size) and remedying these can be expensive. <br><br>The collateral is dubious too. These are more like buying credit card paper and if they have been worked over before, chances are the buyer isn&#39;t going to pay. So what you&#39;re getting essentially has been picked through before by larger players. <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br>This gives me a idea. This idea could be a profit center in itself. The wheels are turning. Let me put this out there, please give me your thoughts.<br><br>How about creating a credit facility program/product available to those loan pool and bulk asset/bulk REO traders who are experienced, where they have two options. Option 1) Buy and hold for their own portfolio and pay Dandrew a predetermined monthly payment on each note on the credit line,  but they have to buy in bulk, so in essence, if they used their line to buy 50 notes, even though they are buying in bulk, they are paying on a per note basis. Option 2) Dandrew makes a equity investment and  I&#39;m taking this idea from the 40K Flips webinar, they either pay a Dandrew 15% profit or 12% per month until they retire the notes.<br><br>The risk is that they won&#39;t repay Dandrew because a note or notes go bad, so Dandrew files a UCC-1 and has a interest in each note or pool of notes or property, this way if it goes bad, Dandrew can recover the assets and facilitate a sale, thus recovering their monies.<br><br>This is Equity Sharing on steroids.         </p>

          James<br><br>You&#39;ve come a long way since before you became a Private Equiteer. Now you&#39;re thinking about what can go wrong and how to *structure the risk* away from your investors. I like that. <br><br>I think an 70/30 split after a 12% pref (or IRR look back) is what the market is clocking in at. <br><br>That is what Gordon and I are around for similar JV facilities for NPNs. <br><br>Remember, equity is not debt. <br><br>Credit is debt. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I have a multifamily portfolio deal in Dallas -Houston, TX, that pass all our Pre-qualification questions (e.g. skin in the game, NOI can service the debt, 91%  occupancy, sponsor experience, etc.), but the loan amount required is $314,000,000. Since the loan amount is huge, I have advised the sponsor to try breaking down the portfolio in groups of buildings, so there would be several loans.  To further assist the sponsor, I need to know:<br>1.  What would be the max loan amount Dandrew would provide? This would help us grouping the assets, to fit Dandrew’s criteria).<br>2. Is Dandrew-Sal interested in a JV? <br>Thank you<br>        </p>

          Fulga:<br><br>We need to clarify a few things: <br><br>1.  That pass all *our* Pre-qualification.<br>Who is “our”? Fulga’s or Dandrew’s pre-qualifications? I’m only interested in the 5 Data Points for each asset at first. Nothing more. <br><br>2.  What is his experience managing this asset class? Did you ask for a Deal Sheet from him? <br><br>3.  Where are these assets coming from? Are you direct to the seller, who I imagine should be a lender or a large REIT? <br><br>4.  How long have they been looking for capital for this deal? <br><br>5.  Do you have – on an Excel spreadsheet – the assets that are included into this big trade? <br><br>If the numbers and experience add up, anything is possible. Right now these larger deals don’t usually flow downstream to the students as they are picked up by larger firms who have a lower cost of capital. Which makes me wonder about why they are coming to you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Wow, that is a hefty number, what I am wondering is after several firms co fund this thing, will there be any meat left on the bone and just how much the monthly debt service payments are going to be at that price.<br><br>Fulga I would pay real close attention to the sources and uses statements, do they align with the story of the deal? Also let me tell you about how multi family works in Dallas.<br><br>You have South Dallas, North Dallas, Dallas, Uptown Dallas, and Oak Lawn. Dallas is comprised of 22 independent cities within Dallas County and each is a market of their own, with market conditions that all differ.<br><br>The areas I mentioned above are where all the multi family properties are in The city of Dallas.<br><br>South Dallas is an area that is not highly desirable based upon the market. Rents are somewhere around section 8 levels and can drop to a low of $300.00. This area is a war zone on steroids and there is at this time, zero upside to owning there. No one is coming in and investing any new money into infrastructure.<br><br>The other areas are more desirable and some properties can command rents of $2000.00 plus per month. My guess is that the collateral for this loan is going to have to be somewhere between $800 and $1200 per month or better to make debt stack payments.<br><br>The thing that makes Dallas attractive for the non-wealthy is that Texas in itself as well as Dallas and Houston us that us what us called debtors heaven. This means that those who have screwed up financially can move here and literally start over.<br><br>You can buy a car with no credit to severely damaged credit, can lease purchase a home even if you&#39;ve never paid a bill a day in your life for about $750.00 up front.<br><br>No one cares about people&#39;s pasts it seems. Very bad business practices.        </p>

          Sal, I am happy to find out that we can go so high in loan value with you, so I will get the answers to your questions. Regarding why somebody would come to Fulga with such a huge project, my answer is: Maybe I am doing something right. <br><br>I have also a request for a $1.7 Billion loan, where a group of investors would purchase a chain of high rated restaurants across US; I did not believe it first, so I requested all kind of documents, and I’ve received all the proof needed that they were serious about it (hundreds of legal pages). I’ve spent hours over the phone with the main sponsor to find out details about the deal, and we even talked about structuring scenarios. <br> <br>…so YES Sal, we are getting loans requests for huge amount of money, but I did not take them seriously, until now. <br>I have also on my desk loans requests for more than $50 mill each: 9 JVs, 8 development projects, and 2 multifamily purchases in London. <br>        </p>

He is starting in the business and I&#39;m teaching him about loan pools and bulk assets.<br><br>He echoed your thoughts but took it a bit further. He suggested doing a call with the whole loan trader at this Hedge Fund and ask for a tape of what they have available. Upon securing this, let him model it against Dandrew&#39;s spreadsheet to ensure we have all the key data needed.<br><br>He made a very good point when he just saw your talk us cheap comment. His point is that if this really is an active Hedge Fund trading in these assets, they will understand what a fund like Dandrew will want to see. They won&#39;t be playing games with us.<br><br>Once everything we need is secured, submit it to you for purchase. Once submitted, then work to setup a conduit type relationship where they will give us first right of refusal on all subsequent deals and push to create a flow basis.<br><br>He also suggested saying to them, if your turning product every 60 days because your creating a huge tape, why not just break it in half and trade every 30 days and keep your funds investors monies working every 30 instead if every 60.        </p>

          James<br><br>Exactly. This is called a “bulk flow basis”. He is absolutely right. Have him call the funds to see if they want to “clear balance sheet” or at least having us “hang a number” on what they have. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>He called and they are going to setup a exploratory call for tomorrow morning, with him and I. This could be very promising and I like it because it&#39;s a fund and we get to talk adult stuff with no hand holding. I will update you after the call, looking to secure a tape tomorrow immediately after the call.<br><br>We will impress upon them that we want to buy if they want to sell and we can make a play.        </p>

          Never at par and certainly not at par plus. That&#39;s like buying a slightly used Mercedes that you really want and paying new car prices. Anyone reading this, never, never, never pay retail, you can&#39;t make money that way and neither can your capital provider.        </p>

          Dexter, years ago when I started in the business I was brokering notes. Back then the in thing was trading individual notes. Pools were for the big boys, I.e selling entity to the bigger Wall Street type buyers with deep pockets who understood the matrix on pools.<br><br>I often worked with builders, mainly the smaller guys who did not always have the liquidity needed to secure development financing. Liquidity is a banking term that means having cash reserves on hand.<br><br>How I structured deals was as follows. I setup a relationship with note buyers ahead of time. This was easy because I was in their eyes a shop that would always have product available. I was going to bring about opportunities for them to make money, I wasn&#39;t a once in awhile deal source. <br><br>In the loan pool business and note business today, this is referred to as flow basis. This is what everyone wants. Once and dones are great but flow is where it is at.<br><br>Builders were easy to get on board because what I was doing was increasing their market because they would simply advertise, &quot;We offer Builder financing&quot;. This gave the builder a whole new market niche, because not many were offering this and it bought people in on Saturdays on a regular basis.<br><br>The deals were structured as follows. 65/20/15. This meant Builder would create a first lien mortgage for 65%, a second mortgage for 20% and buyer had to come to the table with 15% down. <br><br>The note buyer would run credit, qualify the deal and say yes or no. If it was a go, the title agent would create the docs and setup and administer the closing. The actual down was 10% but we added back in the anticipated 5% discount the builder would have had to take.<br><br>I generated a commission of $500.00 per closed deal. When your a twenty something kid and your making $500.00 a deal, it&#39;s huge. If I did 5 per month, that was $2500.00 and back then that&#39;s like making $10,000 per month today.<br><br>Now the note buyer would buy the first, the builder would hold the second for income. The note servicer would collect both payments and simply mail back to the builder his payment, minus fees.<br><br>Now why would a buyer do this deal? the reason is that they couldn&#39;t buy a new home any other way and the two payments were not much more than what they would pay a bank anyway.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a deal coming across this weekend and I&#39;ve already been informed already about what asset classes comprise this portfolio of bulk properties.<br><br>Here&#39;s the story. Wealthy Jewish businessman going back to Tel Aviv, buying into technology company. Wants to liquidate all his properties. <br><br>There is a mix of SFR, Commercial, Multi Family. He is looking for .38 cents on the dollar. We cannot carve out, it&#39;s an all in. This is a total divestiture of a portfolio. <br><br>Here&#39;s where my question comes out of. There is land mixed in, zoned for commercial. My question is, if it&#39;s a portfolio you&#39;d want to acquire, on a situation like this, would you take the land to get everything else that can be immediately used?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Where are these located? You can cross these assets quickly *if they are in desirable areas*. If they are in Detroit, don’t waste your time. <br><br>The bids on these are prepared as follows: <br><br>1. *“All In Bid*.<br>This is the total bid for the pool. IN your case, 38%. But 38% of what? Value? BPO? Are these loans? <br><br>2. *“Asset-Level Bid”*<br>This is an *“individual bid”* where we “hang a number” on *each asset*. So if we were to look at this, the land would probably be discounted to zero bid. Yes, I know it’s zoned, but as you have seen in Land Development Financier™ only 5% in the industry actually know what “zoned” means as a function of value and how prices are discovered. <br><br>So I would be interested to look at this and perhaps we *could* cross a trade with someone else. But if the assets are crap, then no dice. <br><br>Sal <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have two Ohio deals for portfolios of SFR&#39;s to submit tonight. My question is this. Since Canton Ohio is not a Tier 1 city, is this a market you&#39;d consider making a play in? The first portfolio is 68 SFR&#39;s, all tenanted and seller is flexible. I got this directly from the owners of the assets and they just sent me the second deal that I&#39;m going to review.<br><br>As always, I&#39;m working g through the night. I can sleep when my bank balance is at a very high 7 figures, until then it&#39;s chase the deal, chase the compensation but above all else, build a relationship.        </p>

          James<br><br>I don&#39;t sleep either. <br><br>Here is my question. I&#39;m betting that the person who owns this is a private seller or a hard money lender/private lender. <br><br>This type of housing stock is usually low-balance, rough product &quot;rehabber specials&quot;. <br>If the values are below 60K, we&#39;re going to carve those out or provide a 0 bid for them. <br><br>So with that said, what do you have. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Re:Re:Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>You stated that: “The main issue why this is a pass is because one of the main tenants leases expire in 2015”….so let me rephrase what it has been said about this tenant: “Siemens Electronics: Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement; Gross Income = $389,389”<br><br>So the lease will be renewed.  Would a new lease change your mind or there it will be something else? <br>Also, please explain why you don’t consider the cross-collateral as a very strong decision maker.  You can easily sell the shares and recover the capital if things go sour. The cross-collateral is practically yours.  I really need to better understand your reasoning. <br>I greatly appreciate your time and feedback on this deal, but as deals start flowing in my office, it’s important to understand the specifics on why deals won’t pass.

        <p>
          Fulga<br><br>So we’re back to the question. Will Siemens Electronics renew after 2015? Are they “pregnant” or not? If so, have the renewed formally and how long is the lease term? What&#39;s changed in the past 24 hours since I believe you stated they weren&#39;t going to renew? This is something that doesn&#39;t happen overnight. It happens over a protracted period of negotiations. <br><br>(And any new &quot;news&quot; will spook investors like us and is a reason why we put these deals on ice for a period of time for the truth to come out...)<br><br>I think cross collateral is great, but if I’m promising an investor a coupon each month, it doesn’t make sense for any lender to make a loan against something – albeit cross collateralized – that will lose value in less than 9 months because a major tenant is moving out.<br><br>Cross collateralization is not a *reason* to make a loan itself, but rather an extra comfort that your over secured should anything go bad. Its also an excuse for a Federal Bankruptcy Judge to nullify the cross-collateralization clause as it can been seen as being &quot;predatory&quot; in some states because we made a loan that was cross collateralized knowing that a) the tenant was moving out and, b) as a result, they didn&#39;t have income to make the debt payments, and c) we foreclosed on the collateral. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Fulga, I am enjoying reading this, however, I am confused, do you want this to be funded or not??? As I told you on our call, you need to have additional capital providers. The number one reason capital providers got into trouble back a few years ago was by just simply writing checks for investments that were not worthy of funding.<br><br>Sal has said its a pass, he has stated that here and you acknowledged it as such. He gave you his reasons and right now at this point, I fail to see why you simply do not look elsewhere for funding.<br><br>At this point from my view and I&#39;m going to say the view of others here that your trying to call Sal to the mat and make him look bad. Sal has said in the past that 1) he is not obligated to fund any intermediaries deal just because they spend money with him and 2) he will not be strong armed into funding anyone&#39;s deal.        </p>

          I don&#39;t think Fulga or anyone wants to make Sal look bad.  We are all grateful for his expert training.  We simply want to understand our deals and what makes them a good or bad candidate for his  capital investment.  We all want and need deals to go through.  You bring up a good point ...is it Jim? Capital consulting team.  How can we make the deal work by getting other capital providers to spread the risk or is it just a bad deal?  That is all we want to know. Why it is a bad deal and or what we can do to make it better or to work?        </p>

          Thank you Sal.  Happily I do understand what you are saying.  It has taken some time but I think I am getting it.  Your capital providers are guaranteed a coupon, income check, on a monthly basis and you can&#39;t provide that if the value is depleted due to a vacancy.  We don&#39;t go by a promise of a renewal.  Only a signed agreement will do. (pregnant test positive)         </p>

          Molly, I appreciate your feed back. I understand members wanting to understand the why and why not. I also understand wanting to know why a deal gets passed on. Were all here to learn.<br><br>However, when someone turns a post into something personal and uses strong words like &quot; I don&#39;t get you Sal&quot;, that&#39;s when I feel like I do and why I came across the way I did.<br><br>I think AskDandrew is a great forum for learning not only from Sal but one another. I value everyone here as a professional.        </p>
