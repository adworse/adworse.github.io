          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on the capital raise for the medical project I spoke about recently. We did the presentation to a room of 35 tonight.<br><br>I did the capital raise presentation and the other team embers handled legal, project plans, etc. After the event wad open to Q and A, we seemed to get far more questions from this one group of 5 doctors.<br><br>At the end of the evening, here is what the pitched us on.<br><br>1. They will provide $5,000,000.00 immediately for a 20% ownership. They will provide management services for an additional 10% stake. These are 4 plastic surgeons who invest together. They will receive proportionate income based off the 20% and cash out the 10% stake in year three. They will retain 20% ownership for the remainder of the project.<br><br>2. When they cash out their 10% stake in year three, they will then have the option of continuing management at a monthly fee of $7500.00 or stop at that point.<br><br>3. They will provide expansion capital for the second and third center and will commit another $10M for this endeavor.<br><br>4. Additional details are that we will master lease center number 1 for $50,000.00, paid $25K each 6 months. We will master lease for three years then we will have an option to buy it for $600K, paying a total over three years of $750,000.00.<br><br>5. I get a check within 48 hours for $25,500.00 as a fee for services and 5% ownership in center 1. Not bad for three weeks of work and some additional deal structuring and negotiations work.<br><br>So we raised $5M now with another 10M  within 18 months. The investor group liked my work and have some additional consulting opportunities they want to discuss Friday over Golf.        </p>

          From a list of medical center supporters and CPA&#39;s who do work with medical practitioners, the main invitation list was created, these investors who pulled the trigger on this were actually referred by a PGA Golfer who plays at our country club.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve decided in my commercial funding business to focus on three food groups, Multi family, medical office and warehouse. North Texas has a lot going on in the warehouse space.<br><br>My question us aside from the lending parameters already established by Dandrew, are there any additional caveats that need to be in the deal to make it worthwhile for Dandrew to fund outside of tenant type, lease duration and expiration, etc.        </p>

          Al, <br><br>These are not for us. This is for a local rehabber to buy. Perfect to be able for the seller to sell on wraps. <br><br>I would negotiate a deal with him that has seller financing in it - *on an individual asset basis* - then sell off each one by the shot to other rehabbers. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Pass. Too small.<br><br>And its Chigago, which means that the average size is 136,000 which is pretty low. <br><br>I would contact Bank of the Internet USA to see if they would want to find something like this. But Chicago is not looked that favorably upon right now.          </p>

          *If Dandrew is bidding on loans from a bank and another bank is also a bid on the same pool, isn’t the bank in a better position to win that bid because their basis level is different from say a firm such as Dandrew?*<br><br>Excellent question. Its not the *basis level*, its their *cost of capital*. It may be cheaper. Gordon will cover this at the workshop in depth, but if they have a cheaper cost of capital they can bid higher. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick question. On loan pools, is the minimum asset value $60K just as it is with Bulk REO?. A mortgage company has a pool of 215 loans they want an all-in on. The FMV is in the neighborhood of $33K.<br><br>Also have a pool from a different seller of 268 loans in Michigan, P and NPN that can be carved out. They told me it are land contracts and they are willing to let carve outs occur.<br><br>They said while most who allow cherry picking/ carve outs will expect a premium price for the right, they are in lieu of charging a premium, want the buyer to buy a minimum of 5.<br><br>Should I send the tape on the 268?        </p>

          James: <br><br>FMV meaning the *average* FMV? <br><br>We&#39;re a pass on this. We&#39;ll be discussing at the conference how to run a book selling these assets. <br><br>A mortgage company really lent on these assets? I&#39;m not shocked.

          Sal,<br>We ran into a problem today and had to get our attorney on this. The seller has an intern that released the tape when it was nit supposed to be released.<br><br>It has about 10% of assets in Detroit with the other 90% throughout Michigan. The tape was not to be released because the seller, an investment company was in process on doing workouts and other processes underway.<br><br>I got my attorney involved because I wanted to be sure we weren&#39;t in the middle of something we didn&#39;t need to be in. I knew we weren&#39;t but I wanted to be sure.<br><br>Anyway, as it turns out, the seller is an investment company that buys SFR&#39;s from banks, rehabs them if needed then resells them and holds the paper. They sell using the land contract process.<br><br>He has 6000 loans right now, throughout the country that he wants to sell and  is willing to discuss with me. He said his pricing expectations are between 43 and 50% of the UPB, depending upon the property, jurisdiction, how much they have into it, etc.<br><br>He said they could sit in these through the term but they really want to liquidate and reinvest because this is their business model. These guys are professional investors who understand the market, the business, financing, asset liquidation, modeling, etc.<br><br>He asked me about deals I&#39;ve been involved with not necessarily closed. He said he likes to know my story on deals I&#39;ve done, what I did with them, he said a lot of deals never see closing so he can&#39;t base a decision on my experience and capabilities by being concerned with only closed deals.<br><br>I told him about the rough deals I sent over to you, but never mentioned Dandrew or you. He said he was glad I mentioned them. He said they don&#39;t buy rough assets in war zones or at sub par pricing just to buy something. He said his firm buys turn keys but rehabs to bring the properties up to their standards and are mostly cosmetics anyway.<br><br>He said their name and their stamp is in every deal so each property must be at a certain level, as it enables them to sell at better prices.<br><br>I will keep you posted.        </p>

          JV/Mezz Loan: Mining/Exploration Canada: Graphite, Titanium, Gold, Silver and Other Minerals  <br><br>Sponsor has a 25-year ironclad lease on the 8,200 acre land located in Canada that has various types of mineralization that were shown in the previous years of exploration.  Over $7 mil has been spent to date to drill 146 holes that were tested all positive; the most important asset is the presence of Graphite (mineral that will revolutionize the chip technology), Titanium, Gold, Silver, Copper, and many others.   The land is valued today at more than $50 billion, and was divided in several zoning for mining: <br><br>M Zone: Significant Sedex type polymetallic precious metal massive sulphide deposit. Drilled indicated <br>and inferred resource of 1.2 million tons grading 9.85 oz. /t Silver, 6.06 % Zinc, 2.67% Lead, 0.06% Copper<br>and .026 oz. /t Gold down to the 1300 foot level.  Screen Analysis was done on 2 drill holes and the Silver<br>assays averaged 20 ounces/T and the Gold came out at 3 grams/t. Based on the type of deposit and the geology<br>data, experts believes the M Zone has 3 times the resource indicated.<br><br>Project would start with mining the M zone. Potential Gross Annual Revenue (USD) (Ag, Zn, Pb, Au, Cu) <br>= $ 134,806,600 <br><br>G Zone: Graphitic Argillite and Titanium: <br><br>Deep penetration electromagnetic survey (six drill holes) as well an Airborne EM survey picked the huge<br> Graphitic Argillite Horizon ranging in width from 46 to 149 feet.      <br>Samples of core were submitted to SGS Research, Lakefield and assayed up to 2% Graphitic Carbon.  <br>Important to note that this horizon contains 14 pounds/Ton of Titanium which can be easily recovered by floatation producing a high grade Titanium concentrate.     <br><br>C Zones: The C Lake area continues to return very encouraging gold and base metal assays associated with<br> Arsenopyrite in structural and volcanic terrains. Recent drilling has intersected Gold values up to 13 g/t over 0.5m, <br>8 g/t over 3 m, 2.4 g/t over 8.8 m and 4.3 g/t over 1.4 m. Sampling from trenches assayed 0.5 oz. /t Gold.<br><br>Current market value of the land = $50 billion<br>Skin in the game = land ($50 billon)+ $20 million<br>Loan Request = $200 million for mining <br><br>I know this is another “Big Elephant” project you are not interested in, but this may be big deal for an investor you may know, who has money and wants to secure his future and the future of his children/grandchildren. I am bringing these deals to you first, Sal before giving them away. <br>By the way, the NY city construction projects are going on pretty well so far; we’ll see!<br>        </p>

          Fulga <br><br>Give this one away. Its not for anyone I know. Actually, be careful because a lot of fraud happens with these deals. I wouldn&#39;t be pitching these deals really. Here&#39;s usually how they blow up and rip off unsuspecting investors. I&#39;ve seen this so many times in oil and this is the same way. <br><br>First,  you find a giant patch of dirt with no oil in it, have your engineers declare a trillion or two in recoverable reserves, issue stock against that valuation, sell enough stock to buy yourself a new Bentley, Rolls Royce and a Gulfstream V jet. Then you buy a few drill rigs for show, syphon a few hundred billion to the cayman&#39;s, reassess your trillion dollar fields and realize there&#39;s no oil, and poof... File Chapter 7. <br><br>Same with minerals. I know, I know, your deal is great. But they all follow the same script. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Where *exactly* are you with the NYC deal. Has it been papered yet? <br><br>         </p>

          Fulga,<br>I&#39;ve seen a lot of these deals lately. They all seem to talk about revenues yet when you ask certain questions, you always get the same answers which are, we just started drilling or mining, were in beginning stages, we&#39;ve spent a lot of money on dd and land studies, feasibility studies, etc.<br><br>Many of these are small companies and the question I always pose is, if this land and it&#39;s tracts are so heavy with the commodity being mined for, how come the larger players with larger capital resources don&#39;t know about it. The old saying of they aren&#39;t making any more land comes into play.<br><br>The other question posed always is how much additional money can fit into the capital stack and where do you want us comes into play as in any deal.<br><br>The usual answer is we need 100% funding. The answer to that is not going to happen. If they had the funds to do these expensive studies why do they not have any equity to put in?<br><br>Why do I see these deals? Because I&#39;m in Dallas and Fort Worth, home of many of these companies and they all want huge amounts of equity capital.<br><br>These deals are known as Dreams of fools because only unsophisticated people looking for the once in a life time Microsoft type score invest in these.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been looking at your blog The Term Sheet on the website and I read what has been posted so far on residential markets being no mans land. I wanted to post something interesting here for those in the community that believe that there are still opportunities. Here goes, and it&#39;s on the web...<br><br>B. Wayne Hughes is a name that many may not know as of yet and I mean yet. Ever hear of Public Storage? This is the company that Mr. Hughes founded many years ago. Okay James what does Public Storage have to do with single family residential? great question.<br><br>B. Wayne Hughes and his new company American Homes 4 Rent is an entity that has come in to the Dallas market and is buying up all and I mean all of the SFR&#39;s that are available and is controlling the rental market. He is not looking to steal people&#39;s homes and gain rock bottom pricing. He&#39;s not asking the age old question most investors ask which is If I buy your home and pay you cash, what is the lowest price you will accept. Why is he not looking for lowest price points?<br><br>He has a war chest of a Billion Dollars in cash. He is concerned with building a rental income portfolio and is in it for the long haul. What can he rent a three bedroom 2 bath home for is more compelling to him than what can I buy this home for.<br><br>Bad news for Dallas investors and this is just the first stop on his nationwide home buying tour. He knows that once sellers know he is in the market for homes and he is not looking for lowest prices, they call and they will call.<br><br>If your a home seller who is upside down and have zero equity or low equity and your choices are to call this guy who says I will buy your home at ask or near ask versus calling some investor who says I will pay you 50 cents on the dollar, who will the home seller call first?<br><br>Go on the new Dandrew Website and read the blogs on residential Sal is spot on when he says residential is no mans land.<br><br>If your trying to become a residential property investor, realize that once B. Wayne Hughes and guys like him arrive in your market, your power is going to erode and erode fast.<br><br>Want to play in the residential market, start a fund with deep pocketed investors and raise a war chest of cash, because that will be the only point of entry you will have, in residential.<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I got the new website to come up. I am shocked that today is Monday and no one has commented on the new website as of yet, so let me be the first.<br><br>This is the nicest website I have seen in our industry, hands down. I believe that this website as you said is a statement piece. <br><br>I am thrilled to be aligned with Dandrew and lif this is just the first of what is to come, than what lies ahead is what everyone should be excited about.<br><br>Well done, well, well done.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I think I&#39;m about to ask a question that may have never been asked before. Now while I don&#39;t have a deal firmed up, I have been asked about the potential of this deal that follows...<br><br>Very experienced sponsor operator, has done in excess of $40M in deals to date ranging from SFR to MF and some industrial as well. Here is what they want to do.<br><br>They want to buy LLC&#39;s that contain very strong cash flowing MF properties. They want to then sell off some of the properties and repay the debt stack within 12 to 18 months and the remaining properties would be portfolio&#39;d then sold at a later time to raise capital for additional investments in some higher risk ventures.<br><br>They have 35% equity in capital reserves that they would be willing to block into escrow. If their available equity is not enough, they can partner with another entity who would go onto the deal and the loan with them. They also have some additional assets they can pledge to cross collateralize. They mentioned a free and clear citation plane and I said that it must be real estate. I told them planes go down in value every hour they fly and the market for planes isn&#39;t exactly robust if my capital provider had to try and liquidate.<br><br>Any initial thoughts?<br><br>        </p>

          They said that they own several unencumbered assets such as this Citation 10 private jet that they own. The escrow thing came from them. They are willing to block the funds into an escrow account so that the money is held aside.        </p>

          James, <br><br>Nothing says that your sponsor has no conviction in his or her own business than putting funds into escrow. <br><br>Insitutions like us don&#39;t like that kind of arrangement, because those funds can be hard to get to, yes, even in escrow. <br><br>In general, why don&#39;t they take some, throw it in as their equity in the deal, and then they get paid *pari pasu* (read (&quot;Even Steven&quot;) on the take out or sale event? <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Hope all is well. I have been posting some on LinkedIn. Anyway- I say I am direct to hedge fund. Is this the right verbiage to use? Some of responses do not believe it as they say that hedge funds can find their own tapes. I then say MAYBE- BUT in this case they are too busy doing capital raises and other things so why not delegate this to guys like me and others???? That is that. I believe this is it... LinkedIn is not the best place to find deals but a great way to build some relationships to do deals outside of LinkedIN. Thanks!!!<br>        </p>

          Richard, I agree to an extent about Linked In. Not the best place to find a deal but great to network. I have 2009 connections, all deal makers, but it comes down to informing them of what we do.<br><br>If you look at the summaries on potential connections, they all mainly say the same or near same thing. You have to stand out in what you say in your summary section.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Got my first tape over- performing- FL., GA., MO,TX,IND,some other states. 9.56 mill UPB. They have a lot of good info on it. Do not have credit on borrowers and finding out if the loans are recourse or not.<br>1 kicker- all 30 year terms with 3 year arm- Int rates go up to 10%. Seasoned average of approx 7-10 months.  So am gaging sellers expectations to see if we can move forward. Do you need credit on payors before the tape is sent? These are performing mind you. Thanks!!!        </p>

See on the DandrewMedia.com website “Carrots and Sticks”. <br><br>But recourse is a negotiated “carrot and stick”; meaning sometimes it’s there, sometimes it’s not. <br><br>There is a convention called “springing recourse”, where there might not be recourse layered on at some point if specific milestones aren’t accomplished in a timely matter or otherwise. <br><br>Remember, these are usually applied on *value-added* deals where there is a lot of heavy lifting that needs to be done. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br>They hid from me the fact that they wanted us to buy this, not lend on it. I&#39;m going to put my head into the oven now. They called me at 10 pm last night and said why do you need this information meaning the 5 data points and I said because we need this to determine If we want to provide debt on this and he said, wait, you are capital guys, I said yes, sometimes were debt and sometimes were equity.<br><br>He said oh I am the owner of the property, I&#39;m looking to off load this. I said, we don&#39;t buy things we lend on them through our capital provider, which is a large fund.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just saw this as one of your responses posted here on the Dandrew Dashboard. Can I put this on my website now?<br><br>We’re one of a few national finance companies that functions as a “one-stop shop.” Our firm specifically focuses on middle market financing (total asset value of $50 million and less) and has reclaimed the space left by many commercial real estate finance companies that did not survive the last downturn. <br><br> Our new bridge loan program will focus on transitional loans with the following parameters: <br><br> Size: $2 – 10mm <br><br> Term: 1 – 4 years <br><br> Rates: 5.5 – 6.5% (fixed or floating) <br><br>LTV: Up to 75% <br><br> The program is available to acquisitions, refinancing, and mini perms.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am in contact with a group that is in contract to buy a nice class &#39;A&#39; apartment complex in Charleston, SC. for $11.6mm. He has qualified for a FNMA loan, including the 10% liquid, and is trying to raise $3.2mm for the 20% down. What he would rather do is to get one lender for debt (long term, low interest rate) and an equity investor for the equity portion.

          During the most recent conference call. A large part of the discussion centered around the 3 income streams generated from a Commercial Real Estate Deal. My question is does the Intermediary ( me) have to pay for the Sponsor out of the money we collect in the three income streams??<br>&gt;I heard that a good sponsor can be found by me putting the word out at LinkedIn. If that is my responsibility, I think I have to contract and pay the sponsor??<br>&gt;<br>&gt;================================<br>Hello : Based on the last conference call, I have a question : Please see above. Thank you.        </p>

          Rocky, your making things too technical. I understand your getting back into the game. The strategies have not changed per se , just the markets. As far as paying people who you enlist onto your team in a deal, yes your going to have to pay them.<br><br>Your not paying the sponsor, it&#39;s these folks who are the beneficiary of the loan funds. The sponsor is the operator of the property.        </p>

          Sal, here is what I have right now and I&#39;m working on getting the deal together. A hotel in Dallas is expanding and has already acquired a vacant property directly across the street. They&#39;ve begun demo work already. Behind the newly acquired property sits a vacant parking structure, they said I believe is four stories.<br><br>They want to acquire the structure, and are looking at possibly taking an acquisition loan. My intern knows the owner of the hotel personally. He went to SMU with the owners son.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was approached by a CFO of an investment firm in Atlanta that buys SFR&#39;s from banks in portfolios and they resell the entire portfolios.

          Sal, the seller of the SFR&#39;s is trying to play a game of cat and mouse with me on this. They cannot come to the conclusion of their pricing expectations. I was very nice and very professional and simply said, without pricing expectations we simply are not going to be able to bid on your portfolio. I also reiterated that we would not be a bid on anything under 60K. They are without a doubt a mom and pop seller.<br><br>I wanted to update you on this. I have also received another portfolio in the neighborhood of about $4.7 million and I am waiting on their pricing expectations.<br><br>I am feeling as you may be on this that this is not going to be able to be bid on, I will see where they stand on Monday and advise.        </p>

          Sal,<br>My intern and I got together last week and we decided that in order to move forward and be more productive in our deal flow sourcing, we need to target our marketing to those sources outside of private sellers who are really mom and pops who have product but are unsophisticated.<br><br>We&#39;ve seen deals from these types of sellers that do to know their pricing expectations or are wanting par for product that is rough.<br><br>My intern began reaching out to a clientele that is more sophisticated and are actual investment firms such as the bulk buyers in Atlanta.

          Good strategy. Love it. <br>The mom and pops don’t understand the market really, the look at things very myopically, to say the lease. Somewhere they buy these assets and never realize what the market is paying for these. Then the market beats them up, realizes that your not a vulture and then comes back to you. <br><br>Time and circumstance will change all mom and pop buyer’s minds at some point. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Good day Sal. I am curious about something. Would Dandrew consider buying a bank that is in trouble? Would this even be feasible as it occurred to me that why not buy a bank with some non performing loans on there and this way you have them at a great price? Are there regulations that might prevent Dandrew from acquiring a bank??? Anyway- just a thought and if you would even consider this. Thanks!!!        </p>

          Richard<br><br>This is something Fred and I tried doing in 2010 via a bank recapitalization fund. The problem is that “problem” banks become “healthy” again through accounting legerdemain…. They are a moving target. <br><br>If you know one that is for sale, I’d love to take a look at it. But we need to get to the principals. <br><br>So, not to burst your bubble, but I spent a lot of time an expense on that and we got zilch! <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I&#39;ve been offline for a bit.  I&#39;m currently re-learning these lessons.  I&#39;m searching specifically for the lessons and link to FDIC that shows which regional banks hold less than two billion in assets.  Which module should I look in?        </p>

          Rocky, when you do it the way Sal says to with regard to the FDIC site, you have the choice of over $1B and 1B and under. I focus on banks under $1B which us what Sal says to do.        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br>I’ve received a proposal for a bridge loan $7.5mm for an apartment project in Jersey City across from Lower Manhattan.  It consists of rehabbing 2 existing vacant buildings for new apartments and upgrading available parking lot and garage.  The 16 apartments already in place are currently 100% occupied.  The bridge loan will pay off existing notes and construct 30 new apartments.  I know this is probably not in Dandrew’s wheelhouse.  However, would any of your cowboys possibly be interested with further info submitted?  Thanks.<br><br>        </p>

I know that area pretty well actually. But I’m sure you can find a home for this. <br><br>Remember, our min is $2mm for debt, $3mm for equity. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been seeing the name CrePig show up here a few times and wanted to provide some insight on it. Crepig is not a deal site or a site for anything meaningful.<br><br>The deals you will come across will always have send POF and LOI attached to it. You will ask for information to be sent and never receive it, ask me how I know, well I will tell you.<br><br>As a test, I replied to someone. I introduced myself, talked about what I do, my experience level and then started to talk various cocktail terms and zero reply and zero information. I informed the person that I needed specific information.<br><br>When I looked at the same posting again, I noticed that others received the deal. I noticed that they were nothing more than brokers who knew nothing. I realized that the poster knew he was not going to easily get a deal done through an experienced person.<br><br>Your going to spin your wheels and get nowhere fast.        </p>

          James: <br><br>Generally speaking, interns don’t really get paid. However, over the past few years some have been getting paid from larger firms. Now you’re not a larger firm. Legendary Intern Peter Kasyanenko put together a very robust and comprehensive system called Intern Intel Private Coaching Series. It is one of the crowd favorites. To learn more about that, go to here: <br>  <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathnifeu <br><br>The way you want to do this is give them pieces of the deal that close. They are learning the business  - and there are very few finance or business majors who *don’t* want to learn this business – in exchange for college credit and experience. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          James: <br><br>Catch-ups are more prevalent in the opportunity fund (value added) sector. This is a defined split of profits that go to the investor and fund sponsor. A high catch-up split would be 80/20 that is 80 percent to the fund sponsor and 20 percent to the investor until such time as the sponsor has received its 20 percent return on overall profits. Even though the catch-up mechanism<br>would normally kick in at the preferred return – for example, 9 percent – it would mean that for every dollar of profit over and above the 9 percent return, the fund sponsor would get 80 cents until the sponsor has received its 20 percent return on overall profit. <br><br>Now this has changed a bit since 2008, but as is everything with these types of opportunistic funds, everything is negotiable. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a question regarding recurring deals where your buying from same seller multiple times. Let&#39;s say in the case of the pool your looking at that I sent over and you buy it and I earn let&#39;s say a 2% fee. Let&#39;s say you buy another deal from same seller the following month, who determines the IM&#39;s fee on each subsequent deal?<br><br>Or is it a case where they come to me and say would your fund buy again, then that deal generates a fee that I decide upon?        </p>

          James<br><br>It’s net out of the bid. So the seller will probably not see what the Intermediary will make. That is usually between just the buyer and the Intermediary. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I know you don&#39;t buy things per se but fund them. I got a deal in tonight that is one for the books. I thought I would see what your thoughts are.<br><br>Class A Office Building, $29.15 Million firm in Silicon Valley. $2M rent roll annually. 8 tenants, nationally recognized brand name anchor tenant. Completely renovated in January of this year.<br><br>This is a value-add opportunity. Recent income bump due to rent increases. Now, what would make this a value-add opportunity? Can rent increases be considered a value-add?<br><br>        </p>

          James: <br><br>Rent increases are a catch 22. I wouldn’t go into this thinking you can increase rents arbitrarily, after all many a mult-family newbie thought they could raise rates. If the market resists, you’ll get killed. <br><br>In retail, these rents generally need to be disclosed prior usually though rent escalation clauses. The market isn’t too kind to rent increases today, so I would say this isn’t a meaningful value-added play. <br><br>And neither is reducing expenses, for that matter…<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just received a new deal from the same seller for the 5 note deal I believe your working on. Now this is a single note, NPN on a 40 unit MF in St. Louis, secured by a $912,000.00 first mortgage.<br><br>The question I have is this. Would a deal like this be attractive because the asset is a multi family as opposed to a SFR? I know this is a small deal and not really what would fit into Dandrew&#39;s criteria.        </p>

I setup emails for that domain as follows...<br>jb@jbcapital.ws, deals@jbcapital.ws, and info@jbcapital.ws., can you suggest any additional one&#39;s that I&#39;m not thinking about? I took your advice and got away from the gmail stuff.<br><br>Also, is it better to have a toll free number in addition to a local number? I am ramping up to really start acquiring and implementing the credibility tools, seeing that I have really begun seeing alot of deal flow.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to pass on something to the members that you have went out of the way to reinforce in getting my thinking to come full circle on the subject of risk.<br><br>Here goes. It&#39;s so easy to want a deal to be real, to put the cart before the horse, I do it, it&#39;s something that I&#39;m working on. Sal has told me just because something looks like a deal, doesn&#39;t make it so.<br><br>Pragmatically speaking, a deal really isn&#39;t a deal until the deal is scrutinized, has gone through due diligence and terms are created and agreed to and then you can say it&#39;s a deal. Until that time, it&#39;s an opportunity that needs to prove out.<br><br>You have to look at the risks. This is prudent business. It&#39;s so easy to look at the financial rewards first because you want to get paid. <br><br>Everyone wants the big score, the huge fees, etc. This is why the players like Blackstone for example focus on the larger deals. Why they undertake capital raises to create a two billion dollar fund. They are building a financial war chest so they can buy those $250 million dollar deals and up, or the myriad of ninety million dollar resort deals, etc.<br><br>It&#39;s easy to bypass risk because as an Intermediary, you have no risk in a transaction because your not writing the check. Your risk is the time your investing at the front end and the only thing you risk is losing a payday and maybe a equity piece on the back end. The funder risks losing their capital, their credibility, etc. People never remember the great deals you do, they remember the bad deals.<br><br>You have to ask yourself what can possibly go wrong if my capital provider gets into this deal and it goes south at any point in time during the term of the deal. On a funding deal, what can go wrong at 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, the day before the term ends. On a syndicated deal, what happens if the sponsor pulls the trigger on a bad decision, are the investors going to have to do a capital call and put more equity in, just to make the deal whole, etc.<br><br>For a fund such as Dandrew, it&#39;s more than just capital. It&#39;s reputations, credibility, future abilities to gain the trust of investors to place monies again, investors monies, pension funds monies. This is why Sal and Dandrew just do not buy every deal. It&#39;s more than just deploying capital. Money has two voices and two tolerance levels, pleasure and pain.<br><br>When life in the deal is great, money is happy, it&#39;s growing, it&#39;s generating rates of return, it&#39;s generating cash on cash returns, etc. When life in a deal is not so great, money voices it&#39;s displeasure with those who had their hands on it. It&#39;s like a woman who is scorned and it gets even in ways that no one wants to be privy to.<br><br>Sal tells us all, just locate the deal, qualify it through the five data points, put together the package, and send it to him. The only one who can speak for Dandrew is Sal and AJ. Let them model the opportunity and make the determination if the risk is worth them buying the deal.<br><br>Funds like Dandrew have complex software programs that enables them to see all the risks, often risk categories we have never heard of.<br><br>Always treat Dandrew&#39;s money as if it were yours. Be Sals Pal and look at risk first, reward second because at the end of the day, if the risks can not be properly evaluated and risk strategies arrived at and implemented, then there will be no rewards for anyone.<br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just keep getting these massive deals on what seems like a daily basis. I have been presented with a huge deal. It is for $856M in loans. <br><br>I am questioning the deal because they&#39;ve presented a offering of Memorandum. This seems like more of a capital raise or syndication deal.<br><br>I remember that recently you replied to someone here and said sometimes these deals, even at the massive dollar volumes are actually very real.<br><br>On a deal like this, if it was analyzed and determined to be a real deal, how would a deal like this be structured? would Dandrew syndicate this deal or would it be structured where a larger fund partners with Dandrew?        </p>

          James. <br><br>In this case, the burden of proof is on you to prove to me why you think this $1 billion deal is legit. <br><br>We&#39;re smaller balance players; the reason is becuase that is where we are the biggest fish in the pool. Why does this person need you and not Goldman Sachs to move this trade? <br><br>So before you ask us questions on a hypothetical basis, why you feel as though this is legitimate enough to talk about? Did you peel back any layers of the onion yet? <br><br>Why Due Diligence did you do before merely placing a question here? I don&#39;t see anything of substance here. No meat to chew on. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I actually have looked at the Offering Memorandum. I was asking really as a chance to get some insight from you as to how a O.O.M. correlates into this being an offer from a seller of product to sell already existing inventory in their house as opposed to someone looking to either establish a fund to acquire these large pools or syndicate some capital to buy assets.<br><br>I have not looked at many O.M.&#39;s only because I have not been presented with one. My thinking is that I can make performance and incentive fees for each investor I bring to this deal, sort of as if I bought an accredited investor to a Dandrew Fund.<br><br>I really need to look at this and its merit.        </p>

          Sal,<br>The question you posed about why do they need me is a very compelling question, one that I lost site of. The answer is that they don&#39;t need me. I am going to put this to bed and focus on the other deals I have at hand.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Actually here is what prompted me to suggest this. Two weeks ago there was that exchange between Fulga and yourself and I chimed in with my four and a half cents and I caught a bit of flack.<br><br>Molly replied and said that members just wanted to get a better understanding of what causes deals to lose traction in the initial preliminary analysis once a deal is deemed to be worth taking a look at.<br><br>I am paraphrasing her comments because truthfully I don&#39;t remember them. I too recently have had some deals lose traction, well truthfully they never gained any, so I was thinking, wouldn&#39;t it be a good educational tool for those submitting deals to understand what causes a deal to lose traction, what are the factors that come out in the wash so to speak, that would make you say, you know, this is not going to be a pass.<br><br>I think that most have never been in the war room so to speak where analysts are actually looking at a deal, discussing it and figuring out how to underwrite the deal.<br><br>I enjoy everything you do, and I will be the first to tell anyone that working with you is for me, the best choice I ever made.        </p>

          Sal,<br>This is not really deal related but more for educational purposes. Just as your wife has you watching that hotel turnaround show, my kids have me watching Shark Tank.<br><br>The one shark who stands out is Kevin O&#39;Leary, the Venture Capitalist. I&#39;ve known many VC&#39;s from my days in the street and they don&#39;t invest in small ventures.<br><br>Why would a guy who is a fund manager such as O&#39;Leary invest in mom and pop businesses? what is the attraction of trying to scale a business that generates $50,000.00 a year into a multi million dollar entity?<br><br>Also, if I walk into the Shark Tank and I ask for $200,000.00 for a 10% equity interest in my business! I&#39;m obviously valuing my business at $2,000,000.00 and that value is not where my business is at valuation wise, how can accepting an offer of $200,000.00 and giving up 40% equity take my business from not being worth $2,000,000.00 to all of a sudden being worth substantially more?        </p>

          Sall,<br>I was approached by a bank and right now I don&#39;t want to put the cart before the horse and say who they are, they said they want to sell their entire portfolio, everything, and he confided that they are already in trouble, very deep and they no longer want to make mortgage loans, they want to convert to a small business bank and divest themselves out if what they have.<br><br>I asked the size of the pool and he said over $200M. He said they would be willing to sell in tranches over a negotiated time frame until everything is liquidated.<br><br>I&#39;ve handled it this way. I said the fund I&#39;m backed by is very real, so much more real than most you&#39;ll come into contact with that they use very specific tools that enable them to see into a banks standing (I was referring to the FDIC tool), that they are principal bids, that they are liquid, and that before I even move to determine their interest, I need a Bio on all the principals, a overview of exactly what their portfolio consists of in terms of loans, types, volumes, % of P, RP, NP, etc.<br><br>I told him that were only going to bid on real estate secured loans, not loans secured by retail businesses, equipment leases, etc. Were not going to be a player in any other space but real estate secured loans and Bulk REO.<br><br>I then suggested that he assemble a portfolio of his scratch and dent loans seperate, because we could possibly be interested in saving them the headache and unnecessary hassles of filing the legals and at best case scenario end up with even more negatives on the file which will lower their credit standing with the fed and make the cost of money more expensive for them.<br><br>I will keep you in the loop.        </p>

          Agreed. Get the tape. You&#39;re doing something right if you&#39;re producing all of this deal flow. <br><br>Why would you need their bios on the bank principals? <br><br>I would bet that this bank has never put a tape together before and they will need a little help. <br><br>Ask me how I know this...<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br> I am simply just doing what you have taught us to do. I air on the side of caution.  You have taught me that it is important to dot your I&#39;s and cross your T&#39;s.<br><br>You have taught us all that it is extremely important to be direct, to know your deal, know the players and the inner workings of the deal and not the country music love song.<br><br>I am ready to do this, if it is real. I am simply going to provide them with a list of the information we need to see on a excel spreadsheet, and have them assemble the information.<br><br>I am not going to take on the liability of putting together the tape. I always heed your warnings. <br><br>        </p>

          I wouldn&#39;t ask for bios. Call those dogs off. Just get the assets. <br><br>Anyone who works at a bank has probably gone through extensive background checks if they are at the level you&#39;re playing at .        </p>

          Sal,<br>We had our month end meeting today, which is usually at my home with myself, my attorney, my wife/partner and now my intern.<br><br>We have been analyzing our deal flow and we came to the conclusion that with being in Dallas and with as much business as there is right here in Texas that perhaps we need to keep our deal flow in state.<br><br>In your experience, is it pragmatically speaking, better to stay in areas you know in terms of being able to control the deal, knowing your market versus say a Philadelphia?        </p>

          James: <br><br>First, good for you for having month end meetings. That is important. <br><br>Second, the answer to your markets question is not a straight forward one. <br><br>On one hand you’re fortunate to live in one of the best pro-business, pro-landlord, pro-investment, fastest growing city in the United States. Everybody loves *urbanized* Texas and Dallas is the crown jewel in the Lone Star State. <br><br>So if you’re looking to syndicate money to buy assets, Dallas is a great place to start. You can attract money by doing that. <br> <br>If you’re crossing trades (Arb’ing) or financing deals (Banking), then no. You should look outside your home state. That is because you’re relying on us to do the due diligence and not yourself as its not your job or responsibility to go hard on costs to do things that must do anyway. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br>This is what you asked me to post about the Philadelphia 170 deal. I really appreciate the time you spent on this deal, going the extra mile for me.<br><br>I have advised the seller that this will more than likely be a pass. He&#39;s asked me to exhaust all sources. I have another outlet but they are going to want me to acquire first then sell to them. Not sure why.<br><br>I was very direct in a non confrontational way and I said I know you have better product, your trying to sling crap my way to see what I can do. He finally said I have a portfolio in a Myrtle Beach, I&#39;m going to send and no one else has it. He was holding up to capitalize on the interest gain until June.<br><br>He said every asset is above $60K, all waterfront properties and he is the owner of these assets and can sign all docs. He said we can cherry pick what we want and the rest he will hold into for income. He said he is not pulling the good stuff for himself, and as I put it, slinging crap.<br><br>Anyway, the new deal came in, all the assets are above $200K in value, so I&#39;m going to take a look at it. A few side notes to clarify a few things.<br><br>This is the same seller that sent me the Canton 68 and the Philly 170, all rough assets. I was told at the beginning that he gets really good stuff all the time. I spent a fair amount of time in conversations with this seller and continually stated all assets must be at $60K in value, and I wanted to be firm with him.<br><br>I don&#39;t make it a practice to rough people up verbally and am not a proponent of it. I don&#39;t want my firm to gain a reputation of being a loopnet type deal clearing house.        </p>

          James: <br><br>In a non-confrontational way, tell these guys (and I hope all Members are reading this):<br><br>*We’re only a bid on asset $60K and higher of value, invested.*<br><br>If you tell them this up front, there are no hard feelings. <br><br>Many *newer* Intermediaries make the mistake of saying “yeah, we’ll buy anything, yeah just send me a tape” and quickly realize they are flinging poo at us. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve just printed your reply. I&#39;m going to use it. I had to adjust my ways between going from banker to PE. When I was at banker level, I said just send me the deal and I will take a look at it, not realizing what I was setting into motion.<br><br>I got a deal in and I never sent it or told you about it. It was to fund a closed down quarry that the sponsor wanted to convert to a recreational facility where people bungee jumped.<br><br>Zero experience, 3.5 % to put down! zero money to buy equipment! and this deal came in because I said just send it! it took me a lot to not laugh when I said it was a pass.<br><br>I listen to everything you say and I am learning a lot everyday.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to put this out there for the community to read. It&#39;s more for motivation. In the past 4 weeks or so, I&#39;ve submitted I think just about $26,000,000.00 in deals and I&#39;ve yet to submit a Mobile home park acquisition deal at $13,750,000.00, the deal package for 12 multi families in Dallas at $9,950,000.00 and the package on the $29,000,000.00 class A office building.<br><br>Why am I mentioning this? Not to brag, but rather to show that if you just do what Sal and Dandrew tell you to do, if you ask questions, if you don&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel and you network with those that share an alignment of interests, you can be successful.<br><br>Now will Sal buy every deal or fund every deal? No, but if you refuse to fall out when Sal says it&#39;s a pass and you keep plugging along, you will get a deal done.<br><br>Think of it this way. If Sal buys a deal and you make $100K or even $30K as a fee, not many people get that kind if money in their hands at any given time in life. If you spent 5 hours on that deal for that fee, how much money did you make per hour?<br><br>Now do one more deal a year, even part time and you will have uncovered the power of this business and why so many gravitate to the world of high finance.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I will admit to everyone here that I&#39;m guilty of sending some rough deals over to you, and I was thinking about how this could be a lesson in itself and help those still searching for their first deal.<br><br>What factors come into play that lead to the determination that certain assets are considered rough.

          James<br><br>Very good question again. <br><br>*1. Performing Notes:*<br>*Yield* is what investors want. So this is why they bid down as compared to the face value of the note. The lower the bid, the higher the yield. *Basis* is not so much of an issue with *performing* notes. <br><br>*2. Non-Performing Notes:*<br>Basis. The lower the better. No yield so you’re buying this for control of the asset, not so much yield. And this is a function of costs and time to foreclose. <br><br>*3. REOs*<br>*Basis.* Some folks will tell you that they will pool and say it throws off a cap rate or NOI, but most *sophisticated (aka institutional) investors* will look at the basis only.  If you’re talking to *retail investors* they are less sophisticated and will look at the rental cash flow, which in my opinion isn’t an accurate way to look at this product. <br><br>Keep up the good work. <br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>An investor friend of mine who buys SFR&#39;s on a regional basis in the TX, OK and LA markets asked me over coffee this morning, if I use Google Earth in my practice and I told him no, I do not and his reply was, you could save yourself a lot of time and frustration.<br><br>My question is, do you believe this is a good tool to use to spot check properties on a tape to see what assets actually look like?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Why does he use it? <br><br>What does he think you would want to use it for? <br><br>We don’t use this (as the *Buyer*) as we use ClearCapital to do BPOs for us. We need to use objective 3rd parties for these, Google Earth isn’t regularly updated and if a trade goes wrong, we need to hold someone accountable. <br><br>Case in point, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, some homes had notes that were actually – performing. On Google Earth the structure was still standing. <br><br>*But when the BPOs came back, it was under water*. <br><br><br>The Seller (a bank) tried to tell us there was still as structure there. <br><br>As an Intermediary arbitraging these deals, *you should not be looking at Google Earth images as it’s a waste of time, and we’re going to get BPOs anyway.*<br><br>So the only reason he said this was probably because he thought you were a buyer or doesn’t understand how institutional buyers operate in this business. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Well, I told him about the Philly deal and I think he was suggesting its use as a means of looking at the assets first so I&#39;m more in tune with the deal and better prepared to know what the deal looks like, just as a barometer of sorts.<br><br>I don&#39;t use it and really don&#39;t like it.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Thank you for the time you spent on ten Philadelphia 170 Deal. I have advised the seller that this will most likely be a pass. He&#39;s asking me to exhaust all sources. I have another outlet but they are going to want me to acquire first then sell to them, not sure why.<br><br>I was very direct in a non confrontational way and said I know you have better product, your trying to sling crap my way to see what I can do. He finally said I have a portfolio in Myrtle Beach I&#39;m going to send and no one else has it. He was holding up to capitalize in on the interest gain until June.<br><br>He said every asset is above $60K, all waterfront properties and he is the owner if these assets and can sign all sale docs. He said we can cherry pick what we want and the rest he will just hold onto for income. He Saudi he is not pulling the good stuff fir himself, and as I put it, slinging crap.<br><br>I am not going to send this until I am sure we have something here. My goal is to make money and reinvest some back into getting the Bulk Financier Program, spend a day at Dandrew even if it costs $15K, to me it&#39;s a great investment in myself, and to get all the tools you make available, the credibility kit, the trading desk service, etc.<br><br>This is what I am going to do forever, this is why I&#39;m constantly asking questions, constantly working day and night, reading all the trade papers and journals, studying various funds and how they structure deals. I&#39;m 1000% dedicated to this and failure is not an option.<br><br>I never shared the following with anyone but I will with you. My wife is very ill. She has had two heart attacks and a stroke. She has type 2 diebetes and diebetic neuropathy. Most of my life savings has gone to medical bills. I sold a home I owned in Denton, Tx valued at $550,000.00 and downsized so I could get ahead in bills and shed some debt and this is why I upgraded to the PE program, so I could take advantage if every opportunity to make money.<br><br>This us why I work so hard right now, so I can make my wife&#39;s life easier and I know this business takes a lot of work but I&#39;m willing to do what is needed. I&#39;m making some errors in deal judgement and I appreciate you hanging with me when it would be easier to just kick me to the curb.<br><br>Anyway, the new deal just came in, all the assets are above $200K in value, so I&#39;m going to take a look at it.        </p>
