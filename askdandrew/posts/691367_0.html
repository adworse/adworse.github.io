          There&#39;s a lot of good info in these 5 videos. Thanks. A few Q&#39;s, please.<br><br>1.) It&#39;s implied that you can only cross trade owner financed deals.<br>So, you can&#39;t cross trade deals that have an existing 1st TD or other capital stack without the owner willing to finance?<br>What about bank owned, bank managed, taken back assets?<br>What about commercial npn&#39;s?<br><br>...Or ones that have existing 1st TD/cap stack that can be assumed, and the owner finances a subordinate note?<br><br>2.) Am I correct to assume that the buyer can use Preferred Equity Financing on these types of deals; or no?<br><br>3.) Will Dandrew (or whatever your fund company name is) finance a 1st TD in owner financed deals; or, no, they&#39;re never a 1st?        </p>

          1.) I don&#39;t know how you got that implication.  I just re-watched that, and my capital stack clearly shows 1st TD debt there in green.  In some cases the debt can be assumed.  In other cases, it cannot.  It depends.  What are the specifics of the deal you are looking at?<br><br>What about bank owned, bank managed, taken back assets?<br>I can nearly guarantee you that banks will not do &quot;seller financing&quot;.  They want to move balance sheet.<br><br>What about commercial npn’s?<br>I think you need to become a member of AskDandrew Silver and let Dave Gordon talk to you about how these assets trade.<br><br>…Or ones that have existing 1st TD/cap stack that can be assumed, and the owner finances a subordinate note?<br><br>2.) Yes, they can...provided that they truly understand preferred equity.  You would be surprised at how many don&#39;t understand the differences in equity.  Structure it carefully.  Listen to Your Pal Sal.<br><br>3.) We will, if it&#39;s acquired at the correct basis, and fits in our wheelhouse.<br>        </p>

          Thank you, AJ, for your reply.<br>The implication is more like a direct statement - even in the title of this series. So, apparently, I should just state the question directly and ask, “AJ, are you saying you can only cross trade deals that have an owner financing situation involved and that you cannot cross trade deals if there is no owner financing anywhere in the cap stack?&quot;<br><br>Please elaborate on “acquired at the correct basis&quot;. Either I missed that somewhere; or have forgotten the meaning of it. I don&#39;t want to make an assumption of the meaning.        </p>

          Keith. <br>I going to use this opportunity to answer your question *completely*.<br><br>Before I do that, I want to know if you know what “basis” means in real estate. If you don&#39;t know, don&#39;t ask me here. Ask the Googles. You don&#39;t pay me to play Investorpedia for you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Look, I&#39;m learning about commercial financing from your training. How am I supposed to know whether “correct basis” is a standard term; or one that&#39;s used solely by your company (a Dandrew colloquialism); or what?<br>Now, you introduce me to Investorpedia. So, no, I hadn&#39;t looked there. Apparently, I need to cross reference everything I don&#39;t know through there, first. There&#39;s many gaps in my knowledge of this business.<br>So, what else should/can I read to learn the elementary parts of it: so I&#39;m not wasting your time?        </p>

          Keith, <br><br>At the risk of alienating you, I’m going explain to you what I see to be the issues that are in the way of your success. I will tell you that you probably won’t like what I have to say but at the very least you will learn something about how this business works. <br><br>If you’re professionally mature, you’ll take this and act upon it. Success will be your reward. <br><br>If you aren’t, you’ll quit and will be stuck in the same mentality of helplessness you are in now.  <br><br>Regardless, the other members will benefit from this. <br><br>Whenever you use the term *”LOOK,”* you’re really placing the blame on someone else. And in this case, that is me. I get it. <br><br>Conversely, if I told an investor “LOOK,” I would immediately discredit myself as being immature, and weak and inexperienced. This is why I’m bring this to your attention. <br><br>If I told my wife “LOOK,” that wouldn’t win any arguments or persuade her to view things differently. <br><br>I see the questions you post on Facebook. And many, if not all of them could be answered by simply *thinking through them first*. I know, no guru you’ve encountered in the past has ever said anything so crass to you in the past. &quot;How dare they make me think! I deserve to be spoonfed!&quot; I get it.<br><br>However, no one became successful in any business without putting a bit of thought into this. No one. <br><br>Second, many of these questions have been asked many, many times before. That’s why we have systems that you can purchase to dig deeper into these. Don’t think because you’re Keith I’m going to take the time to write out a manifesto on Facebook with how to find or what to say to debtors in chapter 11 bankruptcy. It’s the liquor store: you want it, we got it, and it works. *It will cost you money.*<br><br>*(If I haven’t lost you by now, this is where I’ll really lose you: just because you don’t want to pay for something doesn’t mean its not worth anything. $1,000 or 39.99 may not be a lot of money to you, but it is a hell of a lot of people who take this seriously. So by even mentioning “why do I have to buy access to heat maps for bulk REO and NPL pricing” -  you’re effectively telling me - to tell all my loyal and successful intermediaries to fuck off, you’re entitled to get something for free. I pay for that info, its not free. <br><br>If you don’t want it, don’t buy it. But you need to understand that I will place the culture that I built for successful students as a whole before any one student. That’s why people have put up with me for almost 8 years as a cranky asshole besides the fact that I force them to be successful and give them everything I can to get there.)* <br><br>So now I’ll answer your question regarding basis. You can go here to search for that: <br>http://thecommercialinvestor.com/total-commercial-real-estate-strategy/ <br>*Look at #2a* in the post.  <br><br>But really, you’re a Bulk REO and NPL Arbitrager, not a Commercial Intermediary. So if you want to learn commercial, why not just become a Commercial Intermediary? You’re a grownup. You know what to do. <br>www.DistressedPropertyProfiteer.com<br><br>You can buy or not. It doesn’t matter to me. I have a track record of turning homeless people recovering from substance abuse into successes. <br><br>I have trained former military vets to raise millions of dollars and solidify a skill set that will feed them for life. <br><br>Perhaps you need a more tender, loving guru. I’m not that guy. I have very high expectations for *everyone* I work with. Students too. <br><br>But if you show me some intellectual effort, I’ll love you like a loyal dog. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I appreciate that you care enough about your students&#39; success to give them a good reprimanding. Also, thank you for your admonition.<br>I could bristle and pout at your words; or I could heed them and become successful. I choose the latter.<br>I need to take the bib and turn it into an apron. In other words, I will be more diligent.<br><br>As an aside, it was difficult for me to know how many times I should go over the material before asking questions. I didn&#39;t know if I was missing (hadn&#39;t learned) something that was foundational; or simply not understanding the terms, phraseology, meaning, or nomenclature of what&#39;s being said. However, since you&#39;ve introduced me to Investorpedia, I&#39;ve been doing comprehensive research and learning much of that foundational information. I will go there to find the answers, first.<br><br>I&#39;m reading your book, Making The Yield. I&#39;m finding that I really resonate with that, too.<br><br>Keith<br><br>PS. I really like the way the new blog posts are written. The word flow makes it easy to understand. That might be something to consider when producing training material.        </p>
