          Sal - I need to set up a NV LLC.  Was going to contact Fred at Hutchinson from one of the Triage modules.  But, I think you mentioned on last weeks call that you didn&#39;t want anyone contacting him anymore, or I read it somewhere.  Can I  still do this with him?        </p>

          Yes. you can. Of course you can. <br><br>What I meant from that comment was that people were calling Fred asking for free legal advice and he&#39;s not going to do that. <br><br>Call Fred and get the LLC set up pronto. 702-385-2500. Keep in mind to have your checkbook ready. If you can&#39;t get him, ask for his assistant Jeni Starley Nelson JStarley@hutchlegal.com. <br><br>He&#39;s helped a lot of Dandrew Intermediaries. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal-<br>Are lending parameters for DIP loans the same as the general parameters given to us, specifically the minimum loan amount?  I have a potential DIP requirement from an initial cold call to a BK attorney, but loan amount will likely be in the low to mid $1M&#39;s.  Thanks!<br>- Chris        </p>

          Sal-<br>Thank you for the response!  I will definitely ensure the asset is real estate.  I&#39;m following up with attorney to discuss further.  I will also be having a call this week with another attorney that told me that March is his busy month and may have several potential clients for me.  We may have found a great niche with DIP financing.<br>Thanks!<br>- Chris        </p>

          Don&#39;t know if this sort of thing would be of interest. I was contacted on Linkedin by an intermediary who says that she is direct to someone handling the disposition of a private pool reserve from four institutions. She mentioned Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch as two. She states that the pool will be made up of $1.3 B of  class A, SFR, $700M of commercial and some notes, all in California. It was additionally stated that the facilitator has the ability to pull down assets that meet the parameters in a LOI as well. Is this something I should spend any time on?        </p>

          Thanks Sal. Understood. I tried that link and it brought me right back to this page.  I&#39;m just trying to figure out what the submission rules are and how to submit a deal. I called the help desk and did not receive a reply. This is non-deal, technical stuff, but it needs to be cleared up. For some reason, this is a problem for me. I can&#39;t find the info I&#39;m looking for here. This is usually not an issue for me, but it is here.  Thanks.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Some who are new may be struggling because they don&#39;t really understand what Dandrew is about and what the basis of the system is, so I wanted to give my take.<br><br>Sal and the guys are not a group of wealthy guys playing the game of commercial real estate for their own wallets. They are a real firm with two offices. They have overhead, employees, and they are a true Wall Street Investment Firm.<br><br>They invest other people&#39;s discretionary funds. The clients of the firm come to Dandrew because they know that their funds will be professionally invested and managed. They invest their monies into the various funds that Dandrew manages in house.<br><br>Why do these firms go this route? Because what they do is no different than what your own employer does with your 401K. Monies are invested into various funds with these funds chosen because each fund fits the clients investment philosophies. Some funds invest for the short term cash or they invest for the long term wealth, very much like being a real estate investor. You need quick cash, you buy a flip property or if you want long term wealth accumulation, you buy and hold.<br><br>The advantage you have in joining the firm as a Intermediary is that your capital provider is Dandrew and you don&#39;t have to strike broker deals with multiple firms like many intermediaries have to.<br><br>Dandrew makes their money from management fees, equity spreads, joint ventures with other firms, so my point is these guys work very hard. They are serious financiers and they expect each intermediary to be serious as well, this is why they have a credibility kit, serious profit center programs, a trading desk for each intermediary to add to their business.<br><br>This is real life, real Wall Street Business and those guys eat, sleep and breath this business and if you listen really well to what Sal says on the Friday calls, he vocalizes this, you just have to listen and hear.<br><br>You need to understand that once you enter the Dandrew World, you are expected to operate your intermediary practice as if you are a Wall Street firm. Your expected to work. Your expected to be serious.<br><br>Right now you need to ask yourself why your here. What do you want from this? If you are here to become super wealthy and become a jet setter, well than you probably won&#39;t see that happen, just because you want it to be. Those who go into a venture with that intention or goal rarely see it happen.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick observation on the distressed asset marketplace. I read an article at 5 am this morning where it is looking like overall market conditions for assets that are pooled are getting better, however, due to the amount  of commercial debt to the tune of I believe it was quoted at ten trillion dollars and counting is increasing, mostly because of those commercial property owners not being able to readily refi through convention banking channels, we are going to see a new wave of distressed assets entering the secondary markets.<br><br>It is like one drug dealer gets busted and off the streets and a new one takes over that guys market. This got me to really thinking, well not about the drug dealer occupation, but from a marketing standpoint, that every Intermediary here has a great opportunity to make a play in almost every asset class because instead of dealing with the financial institutions who hold the paper, we can now reach out to and appeal to those asset owners themselves who really have no chance of being kept from being any more upside down than they are or soon to be.<br><br>Any thoughts on this?        </p>

          I understand about submitting the entire deal at that web site.  But I thought you wanted only the 5 pts info first without all of the other details and then wait for your yes or no before submitting it all.  Is that right?          </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>Please explain a little further your inquiry today about what kind of money this client may have? Do you mean cash and liquidity or more about how much they have to make some plays with now? Also, as to what they don&#39;t like, is this discerning the asset classes they won&#39;t invest in or more so short or long play strategy. <br>They are open to both short and long plays depending on the deal. They are actively visiting/evaluating properties now...<br><br>Also, is there a document available to me here that effectively delineates the responsibilities and distribution of commissions for me an intermediary and a RE (resi) agent who&#39;s referring these clients to me? The agent is touring with one partner to show properties now... <br><br>Eric        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>A client is looking to make some initial plays in the US. They are Canadian and experienced w/ a portfolio there. They want to know the best vehicle/entity to invest through here. Do you recommend LLC or C Corp. or even S Corp or a combination of these that would be wholly owned by their parent corp in Canada?<br><br>Also they are wondering which strategy they should use to begin with. They&#39;re focused on multifamily, self storage and small strip retail. They and I are seeking to build a long term relationship here.They are asking me about non-recourse or portfolio loans... What direction would you offer?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Eric        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just some observations about the call today. First, as always, great information and great  call by you and AJ. I think people are missing one important caveat of Dandrew&#39;s business model, which is we lend on assets not buy them. I think if this can be wrapped around, there will less time spent pursuing deals that will not be looked at.<br><br>Another important thing to mention is that the more complex a deal the longer it will take to close. Naturally some deals take longer to close, and this is where deal management and heavy lifting come into play.<br><br>I think the question should always be asked when a Intermediary first looks at a deal is If I, meaning the Intermediary were going to invest their own money into a deal, would this be that deal.<br><br>Just a few thoughts.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a observation about being direct. I think some are not understanding what it means to be direct. This us for the new people. The only way you will get to be direct is to speak to and get your deal docs and answers to the five data points from the decision maker.<br><br>When someone is dealing with intermediaries and gate keepers, you will never get to be direct and please know that you can sign every NCND and NDA there is and you will never get close, unless your dealing with the real estate broker, attorney, CPA, etc.<br><br>You never want to deal with anyone who is not the decision maker, because what generally happens is you get someone else&#39;s interpretation of the deal details and no one can agree to terms except the decision maker.        </p>

          Good morning Sal:<br>I really need your help on getting the phone calls and emails scripts for calling banks and buyers that was promised three weeks ago during our coaching session as part of doing our homework. After many requests in the Dandrew community (as per your advice), we finally received a 2-page script, but it was for calling the brokers, not the banks, nor the buyers.<br><br>I have spent a large amount of money in building a credible business so I can be a serious player in the investing community; however, almost everybody we dealt with was requesting a LOI and Proof of Funds before engaging in any business relationship with us.  <br><br>In addition to creating a Commercial Real Estate Financing Club, I’ve purchased a list of the top commercial brokers in the 22 cities where Dandrew prefers to do business and blasted emails; the response is tremendous, and I am looking forward to great deals to come in our pipeline! The big issue we’ve experienced so far is that we cannot “show our money” to prove that we are able to “walk our talk”. Please help us with this issue that was discussed during our coaching call and it was also promised by you. You may or may not remember that we were asking for $10,000 instead of $5,000 and you said that you’ll see what you could do to help, so we are still waiting. <br><br>Thank you for your understanding and support.<br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I sent you scripts. What do you want changed to them. What is the ideal script you want. For banks? I can do that. Buyers? I can do that too. <br><br>Also, we&#39;re not going to be able to get a POF out to you for reasons that I&#39;ve communicated in the past. *This was never promised at all as a condition of membership or otherwise.* This is the boards decision, not mine alone.

          HI Sal, this is Dave Dean again.  I had a conference call with my realtor and the company that is doing the non-conforming notes. Here is what he said in a nutshell. Hopefully you can clear the mud for me. He said he is a business and not a broker of pools. They purchase notes that are 75% non-conforming and 25% REO&#39;s. They fix and flip the REO&#39;s and put the money back to the investors and re-work the non-conforming back to the homeowners. After 6 to 8 months of seasoning they re-sell the notes. They are getting there investors 300% returns. He wants to see a letter of intent and proof of funds and they will get the notes and do the due diligence at this time they submit to you the properties they picked. He is currently working a 12 mil project with a group in Utah and another in Florida. They let me know they don&#39;t comingle any assets and keep everything transparent. They like to work in the 2 mil to 20 mil range and can have the properties to show in around 2 weeks for them to do the due diligence work. I know you said let it go but the realtor has worked with this group before and asked me to present it again to you.        </p>

          CMBS Loans Follow-Up<br>Sal, thank you for your fast response; greatly appreciated! I need to clarify some of our discussion points, so we are on the same page;<br><br>I did not purchase a list of CMBS loans, but a membership to an Internet Provider of ALL Troubled Assets; I can assure you would be impressed about the amount of information provided (access to $8 trillion of commercial property sales, including financing and foreclosures, search for specific property, loan or investor attributes, explore 40,000+ company profiles for the players involved in each deal and much more). <br><br>Let me clarify now my question: Is the CMBS approach the best one for controlling a multifamily complex? The training claims that CMBS loans are “the ticket for building an empire” because the CMBSs have no commercial transactional funding. One can get full control without the associated liabilities, so I assumed it’s the best and maybe the easiest way to go, but I need your expert advice on this.  If you give me the blessing, then I will put some efforts in place to achieve this business goal. If you re-direct me to another strategy, please explain which the best way to go is. <br><br>I am not sure what you meant by “What you’re doing here is mixing 2 different strategies: buying (“Capital Formation”) and funding (“Capital Placement”), but you make an excellent point because the training video talks about both under “deal structuring”, and that was exactly my confusion and question about (it did not make any sense to assume a loan when one could just buy the shares).<br><br>Going back to what I would like to do with your help is : find a “qualified CMBS loan” in my cities of interest, make an offer to the owner to purchase the shares on his company, and close the deal.  I would also want to use Dandrew’s financing if I do not have enough capital for the shares’ purchase. Your thoughts on this? Go/No Go?<br><br>Thank you again for all your time spent with me. I am truly grateful.<br>        </p>

        <p>
          One of my business goals this year is securing a passive stream of income by controlling a multifamily apartment.  Going through the training materials, I concluded that the best way to accomplish this is to look at CMBS loans and buy the shares of the owner’s LLC; however, I am confused with the training video on Deal Structuring for Buying Stabilized Assumable Loans. Here are the steps from the video:<br>1.  Pre-Qualify the deal (5 points); Better if Stabilized; Debt Stack: CMBC<br>        *  Loans are assumable, but we must QUALIFY to assume a loan.<br>        *  Defeasance to consider as well, which would increase the payoff substantially<br>2.  When we find a deal we put it into a BK remote: cannot bankrupt the SPA.<br>3.  Work with an experienced attorney, not Title companies. <br>4.  Real Estate is held in a SPE (Special Purpose Entity) that is a LLC or LP<br>5.  The Seller (SPC) is a LLC that has a beneficiary, so is the buyer. The deal is structured such as the Buyer LLC (beneficiary) takes the place of the Seller LLC (beneficiary); we are switching chairs. Servicer does not know anything about the switch, so we should NOT pay 1% assumption fee. As a result, there is no commercial transactional funding…we go back door and SWITCH ownerships. We control the asset without ownership.  <br><br>Questions: Why should we go through the trouble of assuming a CMBC loan and risk failing the qualification as sponsors when we can go back door and buy the shares of the LLC and control the asset? What am I missing in the process? Were the first 1-3 steps informational only and step 4 is the one that we should really follow? If so, <br>would these be the steps?: (a) find CMBS loans, (b) qualify them, (c) submit the qualified deals to Dandrew, (d) call the owner, (e) propose a structured deal: need the script, and (f) submit the term sheet. I don’t usually run a business by feelings, however, “my gut” is telling me there is no logic in this step sequence.  Please advice.<br>        </p>

        <p>
          Fulga<br><br>First, this is great the steps you laid out. But, let me be clear here. You purchased a list of CMBS loans that you wanted to do something with. I didn’t advise you to do that. <br><br>However, with that said,  I’ve *never* traditionally assumed a first trust debt paying the assumption fee. That is just the bank’s way of trying to extort more fees from the borrower. Banks like to charge fees for no reason whatsoever. I know this, because we do the same thing. That is why we’ve never gone through the hoops of qualifying when we’ve assumed assets. <br><br>What you’re doing here is mixing 2 different strategies: buying (“Capital Formation”) and funding (“Capital Placement”). <br><br>So your questions might seem confusing at first glance, so here is what I would do following your lettering convention for *assumable loans*. <br><br>Remember, I only want you to be successful here. So this is why I’m taking the time to right-size this for you:<br><br>a.  Find *assets that have CMBS loans*. <br>These can come from listings and, sometimes LoopNet. Some deals you can find by using the keyword search *“assumable”*<br><br>b.  *Qualify them using the 5 Data Points*. <br>If the numbers make sense, make an offer for *you* to purchase. We don’t buy anything, remember we just fund things.  <br><br>c.  Submit the *pre-*qualified deal to Dandrew *for Sal to give his opinion only on via AskDandrew*. Remember, we don’t buy anything, we fund a lot of things. And if the debt is already in place, what do you need me for? <br><br>d.   Call owner. <br><br>e.  Propose deal structure after Sal has given his opinion. <br><br>Present the deal the way Sal has told you to present this deal. <br><br>f.  Submit the *LOI* to your buyer and see if he bites. <br><br>Regarding “feelings”, I don’t know what you mean, however, I think I clarified this for you. Remember, there is only so much “autopilot” you can do in this business as it still requires some face-to-face time. Would you have decided to buy anything from me if you didn’t get to know me over a 1.5 – 2 hour webinar? No. Same here. *Commercial deal makers know how to romance…* <br><br>And lastly, the scripts I’m working on will be emailed to you directly as you are a Virtual Coaching Member. Give me about 1 hour for that. It will be worth it and I’m sorry I didn’t get them to you sooner. <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Good to see you back at the helm. I wanted to pass on a strategy I have used for years to build a book of contacts in the commercial real estate space.<br><br>I go to the website www.cityfeet.com and I type in the city and state as well as select the asset class I want to search. I then look at each property advertised for sale. I then wrote down the brokers agency name, brokers name, phone number and email address if listed.<br><br>I then call that broker during day time business hours, which is very important to know, because you look much more professional when you call during business hours.<br><br>I introduce myself as follow. My name is James Balter, I am the CEO and Director of Capital Markets for JJB Capital Advisors. I am calling you today because I was once referred to you as someone who has clients who needc funding for commercial real estate opportunities.<br><br>When can we meet at your office to discuss doing some business. That is it, From there, the response is usually either, when are you available James, right now I do not have any clients who need funding but do you have a media package for your firm you can email me or I have a client or clients who really need funding and then its either lets meet today or tomorrow or I get to hear a country music song.<br><br>Either way, this is a system I have used for years and years, from my days of brokering notes in the early 1990&#39;s to today. Try it, it works.        </p>

          Hi, I sent a request a while back about a bank offering non-conforming notes in the Orange County area of California. I have a realtor who has the contact. I just spoke with her about the notes and they are offering them at 65% on the dollar. I just listened to the latest coaching call and your team seem interested in these kind of notes. Orange County is one of the most prime markets in california. I would really like your assistance and advice about these. The realtor would like to arrange a conference call so the bank could talk to you directly. The realtor informed me that these contacts have given other investors at least a 35% ROI. I am not familiar with this type of investing and would really appreciate your help with this. Thank you        </p>

          Sondra<br><br>It depends. Here&#39;s why. There are many people that provide leads but the real story is how credible are these leads. I&#39;ve seen many people pay for leads only to lead to crying.

          For the purpose of our business focus and efficiency, we need to better understand a line of the Submission Form /General question related on how would Dandrew participate in the deal: as a Purchaser or Financier.  Our question is: what type of assets is Dandrew willing to purchase? If an asset meets the stage 1 and 2 qualification points, is Dandrew willing and able to purchase the asset or there is a contingency in place (e.g. align another buyer)? <br><br>Thank you <br>        </p>

        <p>
          My questions are directly related to the 5-week live coaching calls and we need your help on clarifying topics related to our homework and its integration with the overall business strategy. <br><br>WEEK1: We briefly discussed the three bases for deals. Our homework was to find two cash institutional buyers for each of our cities of interest by using Google search. After two days of “searching REIT institutions” and making the appropriate calls, my assistant gave up because most of the info was obsolete, so it was obvious we had to change the strategy. During our first call we did not discuss the subject “Starting the marketing machine and putting your business on autopilot” we decided to define our own strategy and implement it the best that we could. We found a company that provides a detailed list of commercial real estate banks (decision makers’ info), but also a list of buyers who specialize in each deal type (multifamily, office space, student housing etc.). For us this was the answer for the topic “putting your business on autopilot”. Once we have detailed and accurate lists, we can make phone calls to develop the relationships needed. Since the SW can blast thousands of script emails to all parties, it also brings on board the “automation” side. We are also planning visits to small local banks so we can meet the decision makers on a personal level.<br><br>WEEK 2: During the entire 2nd coaching call we had the impression that we did not know what we were doing since we were critiqued as “being all over the place”; since we accomplished our homework 100% and much more, we were pretty demoralized and confused by your feedback. We also concluded that our interpretation of the “entire marketing on autopilot” was not aligned with your vision. With this in mind, please clarify what exactly the “start the marketing machine and putting your business on autopilot” is all about and what are the implementation steps. We will change our marketing strategy according to your recommendations. <br><br>Our week 2 homework was to make phone calls to small/private banks and submit deals to Dandrew. We are in the process of doing exactly so, but confused about this homework; dealing with Notes and REOs is like a stand-alone business, and we feel that we jumped to fast from one complex subject to another, without concluding the first one. <br>Is it possible to change the homework such that we find and submit deals from clients that need commercial real estate funding, so we don’t need to deal with buyers as well? Once we go over this process first, then we could handle deals that involve buyers and sellers. We have leads coming from LinkedIn, and we have a great SW provider, so this would be a logical step within the overall learning strategy. Please advise.<br><br>The last subject that needs clarification is related to all type of deals that need buyers. Since we are told to submit these deals without a buyer aligned, we assume that Dandrew’s team will look into their buyer list and try to sell the deal. Our question is what’s happening if nobody from Dandrew’s list is interested to buy?  Can we assume that we lose our commission and all the hard work with it?<br><br>Blog for 5-week Live Coaching Program: It would be great to have a blog for the program members, so we could share our work, ideas, and strategies that work and what don’t work and help one another to succeed in this complex but great business. I hope the program members would agree with me.   <br><br>Please help us with the Proof of Funds, Email and Mail scripts that were promised during the first call. We submitted the request again during the call, as you requested. <br> <br>Thank you for helping us to see the light through a huge forest. <br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>You will have that this weekend. As you know, but for everyone else, I have to travel for my day job sometimes for the deal business. <br><br>This requires me to be 100% focused on that end as that is how we make our money.

          On the fdic link to call banks with under 2 billion is assets- under other real estate owned- there is commercial and residential there. I have been getting my list together and have been only writing down the commercial amounts. Should I concentrate on only commercial at first and then ask about the residential? Also what is the minimum we should be targeting in dollar amounts. So far in commercial I am putting my cap on the low end at 1.5 million. Am I heading straight???? Thanks!        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick observation that was a result if a consulting meeting I did today. Your thoughts would be a welcomed help. I make additional revenues on real estate consulting assignments in the commercial sector.<br><br>A local limousine company hired me to source commercial locations for their expansion. I located several locations with each location having a different real estate company attached. In discussing what I do especially with my ability to bring capital to deals thanks to my relationship with Dandrew, one realtor said to me, gee do you realize you could make a fortune specializing in funding for warehouse and flex space deals.<br><br>My reply was I can arrange funding for these types of deals. My question is as follows. Should we look at specializing in a particular area?<br><br>I think there is a better chance to get more opportunities to make plays in lucrative deals if we specialize because we get to make markets as opposed to joining the party late.<br><br>What are your thoughts?        </p>

          Sal, <br>I received your email about being out of the office. Thank you for that. I wanted to pass on something that I experienced today and it was a bad call. I wanted to pass this on as a glimpse of what a bad call is.<br><br>I received a call from a commercial real estate broker and they have a client who wants to buy in Detroit. I asked why and they said its a place with a lot of opportunity, and I said well I just don&#39;t see it.<br><br>They became very defensive and told me they grew up there. I asked what is the difference in population between now and this time last year. I mentioned the city has no available money to capitalize on any opportunity and that they were willing to mortgage their own baseball team just to afford to bills that are 180 days past due.<br><br>I clarified what I meant by not seeing opportunity which was that I do not see my capital provider willing to fund in Detroit.<br><br>They said that they are hearing this a lot and my question was well if you were lending your own funds, would you fund in Detroit? I then went into education mode. I explained that no private lender is going to want to place funds into properties with a NOI that was mediocre and with the city in the situation it is in, finding strong NOI&#39;s in properties was not going to be possible, right now.<br><br>I asked them if they had approached lenders in Detroit and they said no one would fund there. My question than was this. A local funder won&#39;t fund in their own city. I asked if this struck a chord with them?<br><br>They said I know nothing. I said well your incorrect on that because I understand true market conditions which in this case are not strong and not incentivized. I said as a commercial broker it&#39;s your job to sell the opposit of true market conditions.<br><br>My point in posting this is as follows. Know the markets your working in. Know what&#39;s going on, know the deals that are coming to town. Don&#39;t raise capital for deals in areas that are like Detroit. Logically, there is the argument that the city is depressed so there are opportunities, however, in reality, when a city or area is as depressed as a Detroit, even the prime opportunities are not prime.<br><br><br>        </p>

          James: <br><br>Let me bottom line this for you: <br><br>*If this was your entire life savings, would you invest with this guy in Detroit because he brow-beat you and was from there?*<br><br>*Sal&#39;s Rule: Always look at the numbers dispassionately. When emotion gets into an investment, that is how you get fleeced.*<br><br>Good dialogue and thanks for posting here. It seems like you - and hopefully the community here - will learn from this. <br><br>And, brokers will never have an alignment of interest with you ever. Never take advice from someone who doesn&#39;t have some skin in the game. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          5-Week Live Coaching Status Report as of Feb 27, 2014 <br><br>We are in the 3rd week of coaching, and after giving a serious consideration on how to set-up this complex business and run it efficiently I’ve came up with a general strategy shared below. The credibility kit helps a lot, however, there is so much more to be done and so many questions to be answered. I am learning this business as fast as I can, while implementing a strategy that makes logical sense to me.  To accomplish this we identified first all our players who request a commercial loan, those who want to sell and those who want to invest: small banks, brokers, title companies, attorneys etc. The next logical step was to identify the best SW provider that have the “ready to go” lists for all our players and capable to use the email blast feature. One step further, is be able to identify a buyer for each specific deal available for sale. Here is the additional work associated with the implementation of the marketing plan. Pease note that in the absence of a direct guidance, we were facing a lot of “trial and error”.<br><br>1.  Website: We were working on improving the website to cover the entire business. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and PPC (pay-per-click) will be implemented as soon as we have clarity on the marketing budget. <br><br>2.  Social Networking/LinkedIn: we were getting too much garbage, so our new strategy is (a) to create and manage two specific groups (one for financing and one for investing) and (b) upgrade our membership to Executive where we can use “In Mail” feature that guarantees responses. For $87/month we can send 25 email/month. Our goal is to send emails to all “Chief Credit Officers” from the banks of our choice; according to LinkedIn, they have to respond if they have the same membership. <br><br>Note: So far we received about 500 emails via LinkedIn and website: about 90% solicitations are selling leads, 2% need financing and one is a tape. We are still qualifying them. <br><br>3.  Phone calls to small banks: We compiled a small database with info for all banks in Austin, Huston, Dallas and Son Antonio with total assets smaller than $500 mil, who also have “Other Real Estate Assets” due by 90 or more days. We made about 15 calls. Since we did not get the promised script from you, we created our own as follows: “ Hi, I am Fulga Iancu, from DCP capital in NY. We are a principal buyer of commercial real estate products. I want to speak with someone in your loan sale department to see if they have any commercial real estate assets that need to be removed from the balance sheet.” We were always transferred to the “Chief Credit Officer” line, but got the voice mail, and left the same voice message, with minor exceptions. From 15 calls, we could reach one chief executive officer who was very pleasant, but unfortunately was not able to work with us due to “regulation issues”. <br><br>4.  Business/marketing on autopilot. Status: we identified the Internet SW provider with info about buyers, sellers, investors, and even more find the buyer for each type of asset. Since is very expensive, we need to work on the budget allocation first before committing to one year membership. <br><br>5.  Building relationships: Not done yet! We will make personal phone calls on a daily basis to our potential clients and keep records of the phone conversations with follow ups. The book deal is a good start, but there are great CRMs (customer relationship management) that do a pretty good job in managing the client relationships). I am fond of personal visits to regional small banks and get face to face with the decision makers. <br><br>It is obvious that implementing the marketing plan and putting the business on autopilot takes time and money. What I did so far in a short time is my personal interpretation of how to accomplish this task required by Day 1 coaching Infographics.  I am looking forward to hear your opinion on this and provide us some tips that would help us do better.<br><br>Lesson Learned and What We Need:<br>1.  Creating a Good and Efficient Marketing Plan, and putting in on autopilot is a very complex task. This subject is included in Day 1 coaching Infographics. I am looking forward to hear your opinion on this and provide us some tips that would help us do better.<br>2.  Using Google search to create the buyer list is inefficient and time consuming.<br>3.  Thomas-Law website did not work for us.<br>4.  We need the Proof of Funds that was promised during our first call and the phone/email scripts for calling the banks.<br>5.  We would appreciate your help during tomorrow’s session by your calling banks to listen to your “speech”; here is a small list that have commercial assets that are “due” more than 90 days. <br>6.  Anything else that you do not approve from what we are doing, please re-direct. Any tips that would help us to be more efficient and to do better would be greatly appreciated. <br><br><br>Bank  Location  Telephone #<br>Western Alliance Bank Phoenix, Arizona  602-389-3500<br>Plains Capital Bank Dallas,Texas  214-525-9100<br>Southwest Securities, FSB Dallas,Texas  214-859-5200<br>Texas Capital Bank, National Association  Dallas,Texas  214-932-6600<br>North Dallas Bank &amp; Trust Co.

          Molly, <br><br>You tell them that you’re an *institutional capital provider* and that you are not an individual retail investor. <br><br>What this really says is behind the scenes, the sponsor isn’t used to dealing with sophisticated, institutional investors and has relied on ma-n-pa investors to fund their deals. <br><br>Great question! <br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Molly, <br><br>Great question. This is the *story* behind the deal. What happened to it? This is the asset for sale? What needs to happen to make it perform better (the *”key event”*). <br><br>Usually, when hearing the problems that the “Bad Operator” had with it, we call that the “Country Music Story” (non-technical term, Sal’s term). <br>This could be anything from “out of town owner”, to “owner paid too much for it”, to “loan coming due”, health issues, etc. <br><br>Of course, you never really believe what you’re told first, as people will only tell you what *they* want you to hear, so you’ll need to be a jealous ex and dig deeper. That is my secret tip. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Hi Sal, this is Dave Dean again, my realtor sent me a powerpoint presentation and the excel spreadsheet on the deals. She wants to have you and the group have a conference call before they release the tapes. I don&#39;t know why the would hold them back. Let me know what you want me to tell them, I don&#39;t want to waist your time either. <br>Thank you        </p>

          I have been networking with commercial buyers who are used to having to find the deal then raise funds using SEC guidelines.  I don&#39;t make the income YET but I have a great deal of education in regards to investing and I am sure our hedge fund investors are sophisticated. Can you go over how we should be following these guidelines and answer questions regarding sophisticated investors?         </p>

          These people are syndicators. They buy one-off deals this way. They use *retail* money. <br><br>We don&#39;t. we use *institutional* money. I think this would be better explained on next week&#39;s conference call.         </p>

          I am working with an  Attorney here in Dallas who has given me information on a Dallas area La Quinta and a Super 8 that are in Chapter 11. He has given me the name of the BK attorney to contact but wanted to know if I knew of anyone who would want to buy one or both before I contact that attorney. The entity that owns these owes his firm some money. His firm does not represent the owner in the BK and he would like to work with me to find someone to purchase these where he could represent the purchaser. <br><br>He originally contacted me about refinancing $4mm in mortgages on these hotels.<br><br>If you or anyone you know would be interested in more information, please contact me through www.jsdcapitalpartners.com or www.linkedin.com/in/jsdeweese        </p>

          Hi my real estate contact has a bank with non-conforming notes in the Orange county Ca area. The group is offering them at 65% ROI and would like to have a phone conference with you about them. Are you open to a conference, I have no idea what to ask for on this type of investment.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Its 0335 am in Arlington, Texas. I&#39;ve already did my morning run, walked the dogs and I am about to sit and read the Bloomberg from yesterday as well as The Wall Street Journey and its on to business, yes business on a Saturday.<br><br>I wanted to reflect on yesterdays call a bit and usually my comments are really for the new people. It wasn&#39;t long ago that I was new here and I know how it is to struggle with something.<br><br>Someone asked about motels and my mother owned a motel in Edison, NJ from the time I was three until I was 17. Motels are generally not high income generating by single facility. When you have a chain such as a Motel 6 or a Super 8, where your a corporate entity operating a volume business, meaning you have 30 doors plus per single operating facility and over 100 total facilities, than your earning revenues that can be significant.<br><br>Here is the link to a publication about how hotels and motels are valued. The link is: http//www.hvs.com/content/971.pdf.<br><br>Someone also asked where do I get started, what do I do. This is normal. First thing you do is locate a client and obtain answers to the five date points.<br><br>You go to www.DandrewDeals.com and you complete the submission form and submit it. Now instead of waiting for Sal or one of The Dandrew team to get back to you, be pro active and make contact with the client and simply say, &quot;Mr/Mrs/Ms, my funding team is reviewing the initial information you provided to determine if we can fund your deal where it is a win-win for everyone. I expect to have a preliminary answer for you in the next 24 to 48 hours, however, I have some additional questions for you, do you have some time to further discuss your deal?&quot;. <br><br>Now this is where you are going to move onto the Phase 2 questions that are in the banker program and after you obtain the answers to the questions, you than thank them for their time and you simply end the call by saying, &quot;If we are ready to move forward, what would be the turn around time for you to get together the documents we would need? if they ask which documents, just simply say, At this point, we have all we need, I will know what particular documents we would require, once I have been informed that we wish to move forward.<br><br>Now, most will begin asking about points and fees and your answer better be, Sir/mam, until I know we are going to want to move forward, I am not in a position to discuss that. Now here is something very important to say. &quot;If I were to quote you fees and the such right now, I may be incorrect, however, most deals are 75% of the appraised value, 2 to 3 points, 1 to 3 year term, 10 to 14% interest, with interest only payments monthly, with principle and remaining interest payable at the end of term.<br><br>You want to get to know these terms and be able to say them where it does not sound like your reading off a rate sheet. It has to come from you in an authoritive tone of voice.<br><br>One more tip. Always control your deal. Have a deal sheet setup for each deal. This is important as it begins a paper trail for each deal. Keep deal specific notes to include dates, times, who you discussed something with. If your clients admin, Shirley tells you the boss is out of town only to receive a terse email from your client, you can reply back with, Sir, Shirley informed me on Friday of last week, that you were out of town and out of pocket on receiving emails.<br><br>Anyway, these are just my observations and some things I wanted to pass on to the new people who have all the great tools at their disposal and wonder what next.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          As a follow up of our phone call today, please advise if you are interested in a phone conference with my contact (authorized asset assignees) representing 148 banks for the purpose of liquidating the commercial assets in bulk transactions. My contact is hired by the banks to qualify purchasers for the banks&#39; assets through the liquidation process. The program is strictly confidential. The assets are highly discounted  for a quick sale. Minimum purchase is for $250 mil cash. These assets are not distressed properties, but performing. They are not offered for sale through the banks, only through the assignees who are paid by the selling banks. They can work only principal to principal. <br>This may be a great opportunity and I believe we need to act quickly. If you are interested, we could set up a conference call for Monday; if not, please let me know as soon as you can, since I am interested to talk to other principals before is too late.<br><br>Thank you and am looking forward to your  response.<br>Fulga        </p>

          Sal,<br>The call today is still ongoing in the Q and A right now, and I wanted to say great call and the updates to what&#39;s coming is exciting.<br><br>I was looking at the Ofree Website and a thought came to mind. Couldn&#39;t Dandrew IM&#39;s make a market niche for themselves by working with Joint Ventures in commercial real property ownership where one partner wants to get out for any number of reasons, but none the less wants out .<br><br>On a deal like this, would the biggest obstacle to getting a deal done be the remaining partner not wanting to sign off on the deal or would it be the percentage of ownership the selling partner has and how do you price a deal like this?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a call this week with a firm that buys pools of NPN, PN and Re-Performing notes. Quick questions, on the Re-performing notes, the fact that they added the delinquent balance onto the back end of the note, does that make more valuable or less valuable. More valuable in terms of the over all yield increasing and less valuable because it was already delinquent. In reality all they have to go by is someone&#39;s promise they will straighten up and fly right.<br><br>My next question is that isn&#39;t it required so as to not violate SEC rules that the very first meeting or call cannot discuss specific business as there must be a previous business relationship created before discussing money?        </p>

          Could not find right place to ask this question- hope it is appropriate for here. On credibility kit- on Lending Parameters- it says origination loan is 2-3 points. But when we talk to owners/operators we are telling them 4 to 6. Is there any way to change this to 4-6 points on website? This could cause problems when negotiating to get term sheet out. Thanks        </p>

          No. We don&#39;t want to do that. That&#39;s aggressive. We will be going over this on the next call. You&#39;re going to *scare* away business!         </p>
