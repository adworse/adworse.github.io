          All loans are debt to the borrower, right. So when you say, “That&#39;s where we come in and structure a debt or equity deal&quot;, do you mean we&#39;re lending to pay off the existing debt (loan) or equity - if there&#39;s no debt or we&#39;re only financing the equity portion of the price? Do I understand that correctly?        </p>

          David: <br><br>Here is one I did for Lee Arnold back in Jan. Please change as you see fit. It may be a little long, but practice it, trim it down to size, and then send to me for refinement as I have no idea which &quot;Grownup Conferences&quot; you&#39;re going to: <br><br>*We have a finance strategy.  We think that in this market – it’s not the time to buy.  We don’t want to be the guy at the auction raising his hand to pay the last dollar.  We are a strategy of providing capital to qualified investors and rehabbers to control real estate. This is not lending to owner/occupants, widows and orphans. That is a much regulated market. <br><br>I want to be clear on this, we’re only providing capital to qualified individuals with a proven track record - So as to control and get taken out of deals quickly.  We think this market is a big credit market dislocation, not a real estate dislocation.  We&#39;re going to be a capital provider in a market where there&#39;s very little capital. That&#39;s it.  And, we&#39;re going to get overpaid going up. <br><br>The fund will only be making first trust deed or mortgage loans at very low LTVs. We’re going to be in residential, that’s the space we know best and don’t plan to deviate from that. <br><br>We firmly believe that the genesis of this market down-turn has been the death of capital. During the credit boom, homes traded quickly because subprime was the fulcrum for unqualified folks to get in to the market.  <br><br>We believe that these assets have been re-priced to more sane and palatable levels for us to capture the opportunity today. The time to get in is now. <br><br>I want to make sure of the focus here. In the past, the RMS machine market facilitated ‘no-money’ down deals. The whole private label securitization scheme. <br><br>Leeco will be making very few, if any loans to borrowers that don’t have something at risk in the game at the time of purchase. <br>This isn’t our first rodeo. We’ve been doing trades/loans, etc. collectively in this space for the past xxx years. We have the infrastructure to manage this, we have the relationships for meaningful deal flow. We have proven we can be taken out quickly.  And most importantly, we’re very intimate with our housing stock within our geography. Many people in this space got hurt because they were brokers managing private mortgage pools who weren’t operators. Essentially they were carnival barkers who didn’t know what they were doing. That is not us. <br><br>We are granular operators. We’re not afraid to ask for the keys. (More on that in a moment) <br>LEECO will not deviate from its core business principles or criteria. No second mortgages, no luxury homes, no land, nothing illiquid. This is an income fund that we believe is well collateralized given the low LTVs we will be lending on. <br><br>We may add a little juice, but right now, we’ll be unlevered until we see enough to move forward. <br>We firmly believe the edge that we have is our ability to meaningfully source consistent deal flow. We’ve been involved as a principle or have traded approximately XX million in real estate. Our track record of cultivating real and substantive deal flow is why we’re coming to the capital markets. <br><br>Our strategy is this: all of our loans are going to be short term with a 1 year duration. <br>If the market forces change, we’ll be in a position to extend the duration of the loans up to 4 years. Because this is an income fund, we feel as though it’s in the best interest to keep the money out on the street rather than trying to churn and burn it, provided our borrower is timely with payments. <br><br>We won’t be the big bad wolf and foreclose immediately. We’re always going to set the expectations of the relationship with our borrowers. We’re smart enough to know that if the borrower has to rent out for an extended period of time, for seasoning issue or otherwise, that’s actually good. <br><br>We’re going to be in control. <br><br>We don’t want to arbitrarily create any expense events where there is not a return being made. <br><br>Our investment process is very comprehensive. Without getting into the granularities, we’ve mapped out here how we manage our business from the “first call to the close… and most importantly post-closing. <br><br>We want to make sure our prospective investors understand that we do a lot of desktop research before we go hard on expenses. We do not go hard on expenses until we get an executed Term Sheet back from our borrower and application fee in cash.  <br><br>We’ve been very keen to find out why our competitors in this space have failed. We’ve learned a lot and have adapted these values to our core model for risk management. <br><br>Other guys were completely equity based. Their borrowers never had any skin in the game. <br><br>They did not verify income or borrower’s ability to repay the loan.<br><br>They didn’t have any cohesive underwriting guidelines, got into other markets with a seemingly lower barrier entry that they didn’t understand.  <br><br>They tried too hard to compete with subprime and were aggressive LTV’s<br>Most importantly, they never thought about whether or not their borrower was going to make a profit. <br><br>Our experience tells us that the loan has a much higher likelihood of being performing up until it matures if it is underwritten so that the borrowers’ best interests are in mind. If he doesn’t make any money, neither will we.*        </p>

          Most of the training is really great.  I&#39;ve not been through all of the materials yet.  I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of emails I receive from other real estate pursuits that I&#39;m thinking would benefit from our product.  However, this is the first place where I&#39;ve seen an elevator speech.  I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t fully understand it and would be uncomfortable saying it without understanding it.  What I think we really need to get started is what do I say to each kind of potential lead sources, commercial lenders, hard money lenders, etc. when I call them.  I think it needs to be more concise, clear and easy to understand and not assume everyone interprets jargon the same way.  I think this is the only key piece I see that is missing.  I&#39;d really like some advice with this.  Thanks.        </p>

          And which elevator pitch are you referring to? I&#39;ve refined some pitches down to &quot;easy-to-understand&quot; terms. I can craft a new one for you. <br><br>Help me to help you! <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>
