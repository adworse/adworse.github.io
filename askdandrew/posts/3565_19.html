          Sal,<br>One of the most successful note investors in the business has elected to sell off some of his inventory. He hardly ever does this. He wants to acquire a larger pool and will be reinvesting new money into it.<br><br>He has essentially said, tell me what your looking for and I can almost guarantee that I have it. He is very astute, understands the business very well.<br><br>I have emailed him and informed him of what we are looking for. I am also thinking that he could be a great candidate for a credit facility program. <br><br>I will let you know who he is once I see a tape from him. This guy is the Josh Cantwell of the note business. This could be the turning point for my business. I already have a relationship with him because I had a small pool that would have never met Dandrew&#39;s criteria and he was set to get into the deal when the seller decided to go another route on the deal.<br><br>I will keep you in the loop.<br><br>James        </p>

          Ah. Great question. <br><br>*Retail Investors* (aka Ma’s-n-Pa’s) will pay par because they feel as though they are getting a good deal. These are usually the sales pitches from hard money lenders who will sell whole loans or partials to a group of doctors and dentists. The aforementioned doctors and dentists don’t know any better – about seasoning, etc. – and will gladly pay par because they see a face yield of 12-15%. <br><br>Institutional Investors (aka Smarter, More Sophisticated) have higher yield requirements and will pay less for the note to get a higher yield. <br><br>*The lower the price, the higher the yield.* <br><br>*Institutional Investors* also are more sophisticated to buy and bid from banks where the average Retail Investors can’t and won’t.         </p>

          Sal,<br>I may have asked this previously and forgive me I did but don&#39;t remember and am asking again. A gentlemen I have known a long time, has many banking connections. He is a former industrialist that my father in law and I play golf with.<br><br>He is in the as he puts it, the connection business. He called me today and said remember you mentioned your looking to connect directly with banks and I said yes, he said I have 35 bankers right now that I&#39;ve known for years, I can give you their name, phone number and vice-versa and you strike your own deal.<br><br>He said he gets paid by them. He has no say in any deals, doesn&#39;t hand deals off, engineers nothing. If a successful deal is done, they renumerate him.<br><br>Is this considered a broker deal?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I realize we have a lot of new People here who may be reading the posts, your replies and may be wondering if they are in over the heads. I wanted to share the things I&#39;ve learned in my time here.<br><br>First, if your new, welcome. Welcome to what is hands down the best opportunity in our industry and yes, were an industry that has been around for centuries. <br><br>This is a business where you will be a life long student, because there are so many avenues for making money and so many strategies within each of those opportunities. You will certainly get a lot of intellectual capital from your relationship with Dandrew.<br><br>The one thing I can say is that Sal is not the only educator/guru in the business, there are many, but none better. Sal tells you the truth and if he has to lean on you or slap you around, well not literally of course to make his point, he will. He wants everyone to do well, he has said that.<br><br>Sal and AJ work long hours to make tools available that are real world, not the pie in the sky crap others are rehashing and selling that didn&#39;t work ten years ago, five years ago and never will.<br><br>I have found that with Dandrew, you get back what you put in. This is an action business and one of relationships. Without relationships, your never going to get off the ground. Without action, you&#39;ll never get off the ground either.<br><br>I hear from many on a regular basis things such as, I setup a Linkedin page, I have 100 connections but no one is knocking down my door to send me deals or I setup a Twitter page and all I get is friend requests from Hooters Girls.<br><br>Pick those you do business with based upon whether they can actually bring you deals, whether they will have an alignment of interests. If your looking to do Bulk REO deals, your Linkedin page must have connections to those that are in that segment of our industry. If your a banker, your connections need to be with real estate brokers, hard money lenders, commercial property owners, etc. <br><br>Also come to learn exactly what Dandrew does, what their core businesses are, because if you have no intention of having anyone other than Dandrew as your capital provider, you will want to send only those deals that you can get funded. <br><br>Case in point, a lot of development deals seem to make their way here, Dandrew does not fund these. Why would you spin your wheels getting info on a deal that your capital provider will never do when you can spend the same level of time getting info on a deal that your capital provider does all the time.<br><br>I&#39;ve learned in my time here that Sal is not in the junk business. What I mean by this is that they have no interest in looking at and funding deals that are mediocre at best. Look at it this way, the same amount if time goes into a $2,000,000.00 deal, a $20,000,000.00 deal as does a $500,000.00 deal. A pristine stabilized deal as a less than good deal, so where do you think Dandrew&#39;s interest lies???<br><br>The biggest two things I&#39;ve learned is to think like an investor and look at risk first and to ask myself, if I were looking to park my own funds into a deal, would this deal be the one. If it&#39;s too much risk and not enough reward for someone with little to no money, what makes you think the risk and rewards levels will be any different for those with capital?<br><br>Your in the right place at the right time  to really do well in life, how well you do depends upon you.        </p>

          Sal,<br>After looking at Fulga&#39;s posting about the luxury homes in Colorado, I begun doing a search of pension funds who invested in the ultra high end home development opportunities in Colorado. Why I chose Pension Funds? It just came to mind.<br><br>I was quite surprised to find that the Dallas Police and Fire Fighters Pension Fund that has $9.4 Billion under management, invested $400 Million in a development in Colorado in 2008 and 6 years later, they have a zero ROI and they did this a second time in Arizona with near same results.<br><br>How can we make a play here on something like this? I think we could bring value in some capacity, just not sure how we could.        </p>

          James<br><br>there is a lot of fraud that goes into these &quot;sucker deals&quot;. <br><br>I don&#39;t know what the play is. These are assets where a developer is taken off the hook and pension funds are the bigger fool. Usually these are politically oriented and those who win aren&#39;t the pensioners...<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was approached two days ago to buy a portfolio of 12 multi family properties in Dallas, Texas that needs work and repositioning. It&#39;s a value add opportunity. All twelve properties for $9,500,000.00 being sold by a private seller and it&#39;s off market. It&#39;s has a double digit cap rate.<br><br>Currently it has a NOI of just north iif $440K and a pro forma of just north of $770K but I believe that if repositioned properly, the pro forma NOI could be raised to about $900K.<br><br>I&#39;m going to leverage my intellectual capital into a consulting gig. The real estate broker is doing this for 3% commission because I think they have had a long term relationship. I have not had to do any heavy lifting on this so I&#39;m thinking a flat rate fee of 2 points for bringing an experienced sponsor operator to the table and then orchestrating the funding for the sponsor operator through Dandrew.<br><br>How I want to structure the compensation and the deal is as follows.<br><br>Flat fee commission for locating buyer and creating funding strategy: 2 points<br><br>Funding fee commission: Charge 1 point<br><br>Equity position on the back end:  5 percent.<br><br>Take three of the buildings and create a condo conversion opportunity, creating a selling opportunity for the buyer of the twelve properties where they sell the units and use that money to retire the capital stack. The three properties would be the ones that will generate the least in rental income, even if they are renovated. This would be capitalizing in the highest and best use strategy.<br><br>Any thoughts?<br>        </p>

          Sal, something that comes to mind and this may be an aggressive strategy here, but what about doing a master lease on all 12 properties commingled with a seperate agreement as an option to buy in 12 months. The master lease would require me to manage the deal and pay the lease holder one payment per month. They make what they would anyway in terms of income without the hassles of managing and the expenses. I would hire a management company to do the hands on.<br><br>My thinking is that I can go in, reposition them and get them stabilized. I can prep the condo conversion and since the three are by Baylor Hospital, sell them off to Baylor Hospital who can come in and finish out the conversion to medical condos.<br><br>Use the funds from selling off to the hospital to pull the trigger on the option, complete the acquisition and refinance to pay down any remaining debts and pull some capital out to add to my retirement fund.<br><br>Any thoughts?        </p>

I’ve never had an inquiry through PLN before so I don’t know how to address this with the potential investor.  Please advise.  Thanks for all the help and education.  <br>        </p>

          Dave, <br><br>This is great. However, $10,000 isn’t enough to do *anything* with. But you should keep in in mind for when larger deals come down, you can patch together his $10,000 with others. <br><br>I just want you to make bigger money, that’s all! But I guess you have seen for yourself that the <br>www.PrivateBankerIdentityKit.com *works*.  <br><br>This is good news for you, your business and your overall confidence. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>To me it looks like the PLN portion is to combine capital from various retail investors to ultimately use for syndication for a particular commercial deal.  If this is correct, I’d ask what’s the best utilization of the site as far as marketing to find investors,  how to find choice properties to syndicate, &amp; how to respond to investors that say they want to invest a particular amount like the couple that filled out the form on my site - $10,000 for 1 year.   To me it’s the chicken or the egg – find a property &amp; then market the PLN, or market the PLN to find investors and then find a property.    Or, I may be way off base here.  <br><br>        </p>

          Dave<br><br>There are many ways you can generate revenue from this. And, because I am your mentor, I will tell you *the #1 mistake that all investors make is to find a deal first*, and then scramble to find investors. That is a 1st Class ticket to frustration, broken dreams and discouragement. <br><br>The reason why we can do even more deal types than we care to advertise is because I have relationship with investors that are “axed” for certain deal types and if they fit, the get closed. <br><br>So this is a resource that you should continue to keep in touch with, cultivate, build and then utilize these investors any one of these ways: <br><br>1.  Place them into someone else’s deal if you don’t have one. If you are a Hard Money Financier, we call this “brokering” and if you make 5 points on 100,000 that’s $5,000 (5 points on 10,000 is enough to buy a nice pair of shoes for your wife, but still, there is value here if you keep building the list). <br><br>2.  Sell the lead to Hard Money Lender(s). Yes, you can sell the lead more than 1x. As long as you disclose this. $50 for the name, $100 to take it off the market altogether so its exclusive (and make sure you hold to your word that you’re selling this exclusively otherwise, like they say, building trust is like a skyscraper, takes years to build, seconds to bring down). <br><br>3.  Place them into your own deals. If you are a Capital Syndicator, then you bank these names, send them your “What is a Syndication” Pitchbook, then when the deal comes, send them your “Deal Level” Pitchbook. <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br>I just got something that could be a deal and I will give you a brief overview. 12 Notes in California, all performing, all assets except one is above $60,000.00. The one that is below $60K is a busted Heloc, asset value dropped to $18K, payments being made to bankruptcy trustee outside of plan but is current.<br><br>Pricing expectation is 93% of UPB but I think we could get them down, I&#39;m not sending anything more on this to you until I get at the inner workings of the deal to see where they really are at.<br><br>Is this of interest to you?        </p>

          I will send the tape. I spent some time on this after dinner. Here is the figures.<br><br>Original Balances: $3,315,900.00<br>Current Balances:$ 2,179,212.00<br>Asset values (Through Appraisal) $7,326,000.00<br><br>I verified that this is direct from the seller, which is an investment corporation. They stated, we have all files and docs, can ready them for DD immediately.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting for the monthly payment amounts so we can get an idea if the cash flow figures. I will send the tape once I get these.  If you would like to bid on the sub $60K I&#39;m certain they would love to get rid of it. I don&#39;t really think they would mind selling 11 of 12 loans at one shot.        </p>

          2 questions, please.. I put it here because it didn&#39;t seem to fit the other categories...<br><br>1.  Regarding the Credibility Kit.. I already have a Marketing Services LLC; do I need &gt;to get another separate LLC for Camellia Capital Funding (the name I selected for this business), or can I make it a Camellia Capital Funding, a division of Ken Fong Marketing Services, LLC (or a dba).  I need to select the &quot;proper&quot; name for my business for the credibility kit; <br><br>2.  Can I use my UPS Store address as the business address, and not my home address?  I work out of my home.<br>        </p>

          Ken,<br><br>1.  No. Just keep it as Camellia Capital Funding. <br>Do *NOT* put on there “…a division of Ken Fong Marketing Services, LLC”. <br><br>2.  Yes, use the UPS Store Address. That is fine. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Just to be clear, you are saying I can use Camellia Capital Funding for the Credibility Kit, and not need to create a separate LLC for it?  Do I need to register the business name with the city (i.e.Doing Business As)? (and separate bank account?)  Just trying to figure out how do I do business under Camellia Capital Funding, and process checks from Dandrews. I guess you would/could send checks to me make out to me and not Camellia Capital Funding.. <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Ken        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am aware that Dandrew buys loan pools and loans that are performing. You have also indicated twice in recent times that banks don&#39;t really have an incentive to liquidate these types of assets because the status if the loans are obviously current.<br>I have a bank in Fort Worth Texas they may want to liquidate some of these, what are the risks in buying these outside of the potential to no longer be performing. Also when you look at the risk, does the question ever come into play of, does the bank know something they are not sharing and when your scoring the pool do you give the pool a lower score to offset this potential key event?        </p>

          James: <br><br>First, this is not a *“key event”*. A key event is the event in commercial value-added deals that must happen for the deal to be a success. For example, a large NNN tenant signed on to a retail center. That is what the exit strategy is contingent upon. <br><br>Regarding the Texas maybe-soon-to-be-probably-will-be defaults, the largest function of pricing these are *costs required and time to foreclose*. <br><br>I think I answered this or something similar to these, but in Texas, and we love Texas, you can lasso their asses out in 21 days for non payment. If you have an attorney who is good. <br><br>So just keep that in mind. And now’s the time for this guys to move balance sheet because the longer it goes, the deeper the discount…<br><br>Sal        </p>

          I&#39;m glad I sent this. I never gave thought to what key event really means. I am meeting with the banks CFO tomorrow morning . I realize I probably will not walk out with a tape tomorrow but I will walk out with the beginnings of a relationship.        </p>

          Sal,<br>There are many of the PE&#39;s here that may not know that funds operate on a 2 and 20. This is as you and I know, 2% of fees and 20% of returns generated, both going to the fund for compensation, but could you elaborate if this is the industry standard or are there sometimes variations in this compensation formula?        </p>

          James<br><br>This is a great question<br><br>In the “JV Equity vs. Fund Structures” module, I discuss that not all investors pay rack rate. <br><br>For example, some investors pay less and some pay more. And the best analogy I can make is like buying an airline ticket to Las Vegas. <br><br>Let’s assume that all folks will fly coach coming to my event in Las Vegas from the same city. <br><br>The person in front of you will pay more than you did. The person next to you may pay less. <br><br>If Warren Buffet invested in my fund, he would want “0% &amp; 0%”; meaning he wouldn’t pay any fees or splits. But I would get to tell the world that Warren Buffet was an investor in my fund, which would bring more people in who would pay 2/20. <br><br>Sal<br><br><br>        </p>

          Aspen CO: Land at Ski Lodge, base of ski resort (“ski in/ski out/ 14 luxury properties”)<br><br>Everything about this deal is LOCATION: 3.5 square miles land at the famous Aspen CO ski lodge. The last piece of land in this area has recently become available and it is located at the base of the ski resort.<br>Sponsor wants to acquire the land and build 14 luxury homes, about 6,000 SqFt each.  After years of heavy fight with the building department (very difficult to get permits in that area), permits have been obtained.  The land is appraised at $38 mil, and the gross revenue estimated at about $200 mil. <br><br>Sponsor needs a JV to buy the land, with 100% financing, and in turn he is willing to provide equity as per lender’s terms. Once the land is purchased, sponsor will have no issue to raise the capital for construction. Developer Bio /Proforma will be provided if there is interest in this type of JV (100% financing with equity as per lender’s terms).<br>Here are the figures:<br>• Land acquisition: $35,000,000<br>• Total projected building cost: $68,162,600.00<br>• Total projected development cost: $103,162,600.00<br>• Projected sales price: $2,500.00 per square feet or $13,800,000.00 per home<br>• Total sales revenue: : $193,200,000.00<br>• Net: $72,649,000.00<br>• ROI: 70% or $50,854,580.00<br><br>Is Dandrew interested in this type of JV?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Fulga, why don&#39;t you become the JV Partner yourself? Use your intellectual capital to leverage your skill sets to captain the deal. Your intellectual capital has a value just as goodwill has a value in a business sale. Anyone can get a JV Partner who sits around like a puppet and brings no real value, how many people get a JV Partner who actually can do what you do, I do, etc.<br><br>Provide your services as a consultant in the deal, handling the heavy lifting for an equity piece on the back end. Prep the financial package for a $5,000.00 fee paid upfront.<br><br>Think you can&#39;t do it? don&#39;t forget, you have Sal to answer your questions here.         </p>

          Fulga,<br>Call Cooley LLP in Broomfield, Colorado at 720 566-4000, tell them you have this deal that needs a JV Partner in a Ski Resort. They are a law firm that has clients that are extremely wealthy, some I believe are motion picture actors and actresses, pro athletes, Fortune 500 CEO&#39;s who invest as passive investors and Cooley provides the legal in the deal.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I do a lot of meetings on the fly. On any given Monday or Thursday I can be found sitting at the Crescent Court Hotel in Dallas, sitting at Starbucks, meeting with people. For those that are in Dallas but may be unaware, The Crescent Court offices is home to about 85% of the Hedge Funds and Securities Attorneys offices in Dallas.<br><br>One of the subjects you&#39;ve taught us about is having an alignment of interests with whom we want to do business with. The question is how does one create this when it doesn&#39;t exist yet because a relationship is just forming.<br><br>I have found that everyone likes to talk about themselves, the deals they&#39;ve closed or the big deals they are doing. I am just as guilty of this and I think you once said that in your everyday business, which we don&#39;t all see, is that you constantly see this.<br><br>What I do and anyone here can do this. I research the heck out of the person I am meeting with. If I know they are an investment banker for a big firm with multiple offices, I will search The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, The Dallas Business Journal or the same publication from their area, their firms own website. I want intel on this person, why?<br><br>Because how impressive is it to sit there and be able to say, Congrats on your teams success with that deal in Miami or I see you orchestrated that credit facility with such and such in Philadelphia, tell me about it.<br><br>When you can make someone feel like you went the extra mile to find out about them, you give the impression that you want to really do business with them and when you bring them a deal they are known to work with, your creating an alignment of interests.<br><br>Of course there will always be that person who thinks your a suck up and may say no to doing any business at all.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Since this event in Las Vegas is going to be your last, I think I speak for those that are not going when I say, we wish you were not stopping, but some times its better to leave while on top.<br><br>I can only imagine what this event is going to cost you. have you given any thought into doing a live streaming type of preview and charge about $195.00 per person to attend , sort of like pay per view.<br><br>At $195.00, they get to attend live but from their living room or office, etc., video of the sessions after they attend, etc.<br>If you got 2500 people @ 195.00 each, you would gross $487,500.00, probably enough to cover your costs.<br><br>I was thinking about this as a suggestion.        </p>

          Hi,<br>During the call this morning, AJ suggested I contact &quot;Ask Andrew&quot; with my question.<br>So...I&#39;m a commercial mortgage broker in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have provided several loans for a developer client during the past 6 months.  They buy small commercial properties - ranging from $1 million to $5 million (industrial, mobile home parks, residential development and flex office in Northern California) that need some improvements, entitlements, or other value add.  At the completion of the work they flip the properties and make a nice profit.  <br>They don&#39;t have deep pockets and have been bringing in outside investors with whom they have a professional acquaintance for equity on their deals - they typically property at 50%, with 50% equity.  Those investors are starting to get a little &quot;bitchy&quot; by throwing their weight around in an unproductive (and unprofessional) way.  The result is clients want to bring in new investors to fund their deals, and they asked me to lead that effort for them.<br>On the call this morning I asked AJ for some guidance on how to price my services to these developers, in terms of points and equity interest I should receive as compensation for bringing them new equity investors.  AJ drew a blank on the question and suggested I might need to buy another product, and that you could better advise me.<br>Can you suggest how to price the deals I&#39;m asking about or (more likely), do you have suggestions about a product that could help me with my pricing dilemma?<br>Also, I was out of town (in Iowa) from last Friday until Tuesday night (with no regular internet access) and didn&#39;t see the scripts offered in Sal&#39;s email on Sunday.  I saw Sal&#39;s email Wednesday morning, but it was too late to download the scripts.  I also saw they would be offered later for $97.00, so can I buy those scripts?<br>Thank you.<br>Dennis<br>        </p>

          Dennis: <br><br>Retail investors are – as a rule – a huge pain in the ass. They don’t understand markets, deals and like to pretend they are the big man/woman on campus. <br><br>If they have a business plan, which during this preliminary point all I would need to see is their: <br><br>1.  *Bios.*<br>Who they are and what they do. Resumes, etc. <br><br>2.  *Deal Sheet.*<br>A list of deals they’ve done. Includes: deal name, asset type, basis they bought at, basis they exited out, return to investors; <br><br>Then that would be enough to see if they qualify for a JV Equity Facility. Meaning they have a checkbook that requires 2 signatures (ours and their’s…)<br><br>Review your Private Equiteer training (JV vs Fund Structures) for more info on this. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;ve invested in a few Dandrew products - DIP Financing, Hooked on Overages, Capital Syndicator, Mezz Financing &amp; Pref. Equity, Arbitrageur, and recently bought your Briefcase.  But I&#39;m not a Private Equiteer (unless it&#39;s known by a different name), and don&#39;t see anything in what I have that&#39;s called &quot;JV Equity vs. Fund Structures&quot;.  I&#39;ll be the first to say I may well be missing something.  Where can I find the info on Private Equiteer or &quot;JV Equity vs. Fund Structures&quot;?<br>As I wrote the various products (above), it occurred to me that you could probably suggest the order in which I study them.  I would appreciate your help with that also.<br>Thanks.<br>Dennis        </p>

          Hi Sal...What&#39;s the sentiment that a seller of a note should have if they have a 12% note selling it at 8%.  I&#39;m concerned that the buyer would see the original 12% yield and feel like they are being robbed.  How should I handle this?  Thanks, Hurol        </p>

          I asked this question because I know a source for 12% interest NOO loans and the idea I had was to sell it off to retail investors at 8% interest yield...Is this above board? I ran some quick numbers on it and the gains are substantial ( I will have to go back though and check the ltv&#39;s)        </p>

          Yes. You can do this. Of course. it hasppens all day long. Just the more savvy and sophisticated investor won&#39;t buy into these. <br><br>But the guy who desperately wants 8% *desperately* will buy these all day long. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hurol,<br>I started in this business brokering note trades. As long as your fee is not out of the ordinary, you should not meet with resistance. Case in point, on a $50,000.00 note your not going to be fair in charging more than 1 to 1.5 points.<br><br>Don&#39;t fall victim to what these note courses tell you to charge, they are not realistic.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I had to jump off the call today and get onto a call for the medical project but wanted to comment on the guys deal he went into with you and AJ. This is for those looking at their first deal.<br><br>Sal has taught me to look more at the inner workings of the deal outside of the players to get at the real story of the deal and not what the country music love song highlights.<br><br>I look at deals daily with assumable mortgages and to the untrained eye, these look like selling points in the opportunity and they aren&#39;t selling points as much as red flags. <br><br>First, just because the loan is assumable doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s assumable for you or your client. The holder of that loan is going to want a very strong entity coming in. They don&#39;t want to have a good loan turn bad. <br><br>Next, you have to look at how long the investor is going to be in the deal. If they are paying $15,000,000.00 for a property and the NOI is $500,000.00 or even $1,000,000.00, how long is the investor going to be in the deal at it&#39;s worse case scenario.<br><br>The next thing to look at is what are the avenues available to get out of the deal and retire the capital and debt stacks. Can they refinance? is the timing of the market optimum for selling the property, what is the viable exit strategy.<br><br>I just wanted to pass these thoughts on.        </p>

          Rick,<br>My brother used these guys. They are reasonable compared to others and I believe it was like $99.00 upfront and you pay in installments. They run your credit immediately so they have up to the minute data. If your client would have issues with another inquiry in their credit report, he probably won&#39;t use them.<br><br>Definitely worth it.        </p>

          Sal<br><br>Would it be possible to get some business references from past banks that Dandrew have closed portfolios with, along with say purchasing history of say the past 3 years or so of distressed assets purchases (Bulk REO &amp; NPL) and these would greatly help while we wait for the proof of funds to be sorted out.  I haven&#39;t had any banks ask me for POF yet, but I think a company profile including some references from past deals from our funding source would be greatly beneficial. <br><br> I have gotten some interest from lenders but they are very slow to move and I really want to make the best impression possible, as some are telling me stories of bad experiences from flaky companies and are now very hesitant.,  and now want additional information from past buying experience.<br><br>It could be something along the lines of a document saying that  Dandrew purchased X amount of non performing paper last quarter / year  and is looking to spend Y amount for the next quarter / year .  In addition to saying something along the lines that last year we closed on deals with such and such a bank.  Something a long the lines of what was included in the DIP autoresponder scripts message # 1, but a little bit more detailed and relevant to the Bulk REO/ Arbitrage side of the business.  <br><br>Rudy Richard        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is the latest update on the medical project. We have come to an agreement in principle on the property. We agreed to do a master lease on the property. One payment of $50,000.00 per year. The owner gets a seat on the board and will provide consulting services on the medical management side of the business for a 10% equity stake in the entire project.<br><br>Were going to meet with the architect and contractor tomorrow and do a walk through and get the complete construction and design costs in line and from this I can move to the next phase of the financials.<br><br>We&#39;ve begun discussions with a finance company who will finance patients. What were going to do is receive 10% of the cost of the procedure up front, then setup a payment plan for remainder and then sell the contract to this company. This firm will run the credit, draft the docs and pay us immediately.<br><br>This financial arrangement will be a selling point in the capital raise presentation because we are showing the investors how income will be generated and protected, outside of the cash paying patients and were not accepting insurance so there is no claims to deal with.<br><br>This is where we are at right now.        </p>

          sal,<br>I just watched the MHP deal in one of the looking over your shoulder training. I live in mobile home parkville. In North Texas, this is huge business and some of these parks are 200 to 500 pads, just mammoth in scope.<br><br>I am willing to bet for the right price, these could be purchased at attractive prices. Are you still entertaining these types of deals? what is your exact criteria as far as # pads, desired NOI, crietria for owned vs. rented, if owned and park is collecting lot rent, what is the minimum lot rent that makes it attractive, is self managed more attractive or is professional management more attractive, yes/no on seller financing.<br><br>I am always looking for deals and there are certainly deals in this asset class, here and I agree, they are cash cows and really a wave of the future.        </p>

          Sal, <br>I am learning the importance of not only qualifying the deal but the players as well. I&#39;ve concluded you can have the best deal but if you have players in the deal that don&#39;t bring value, the whole deal loses value.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is where I&#39;m at on this deal, what I have uncovered. It&#39;s a 55 plus mobile park community. 5 star level property with room to expand. Property is at 137 acres. No rent control and well established. On lake, all double wides. Stable cash flow w/ no distress. Lot rents are $382, $390, $409, $437 and $483 depending on lot location in park. Park uses 37 acres of the 137 acres. 100 additional acres for expansion or development.<br><br>2013 year end P&amp;L was Gross Income from all sources of $1,291,422.56 Total net operating income was $723,210.83.<br><br>This has an assumable loan on it. They are asking $14,000,000.00, however I believe that with the economy still in its current condition, the fact that there are not too many buyers, I believe there is a play here.<br><br>The strategy I think to make a play is to acquire the property net of the assumable loan. You obtain an appraisal or BPO on the 100 acres and do a joint venture with a developer. Depending upon the permissible use of this 100 acres, you sell off the 100 acres to the developer or a buyer.<br><br>The value in this deal I think is if you take the value of the park and the value of the 100 acres and add it together, and you back out the cost to acquire, you can make a sizable profit. I believe there could be an opportunity to a DPO on the assumable loan and add that debt service costs back into the Income of the property.<br><br>Now for the risk. The risk is that the seller may be asking too many times EBITA to make this worthwhile even with the income, NOI, the additional acreage. They may have invested too much money into the property and are trying to get that back out.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting in the first qtr 2014 numbers to see if there have been any dramatic changes in the numbers, too see if there have been any rent increases and as a result, a potential vacancy increase.<br><br>I&#39;m also going to contact the zoning board to see what the 100 acres is zoned for and to get an idea of what is happening in the area to see if this becomes a big box retailing growth area.<br><br>If big boxes are coming and the zoning permits for it or can be changed for it, there is significant upside in selling the 100 acres to one of those guys.<br><br>I will keep you posted.        </p>

          What if we did this deal structured in the following way. $10,000,000.00 cash to close now, $3,000.000.00 deferred for 18 months and we bring in a big box retailer to buy the 100 acres. We sell each acre at $85,000.00 per acre or $8,500,000.00. $3,000,000.00 deducted from sale proceeds leaves $5,500,000.00. Deduct this figure from the $13,000,000.00 paid and your in at a basis of $7,500,000.00.<br><br>We JV on this, I come in and manage this project hands on earning my back end equity piece from sweat equity.        </p>

          How about structuring it as follows...<br><br>Purchase price: $13,000,000.00 with $10,000,000.00 cash paid at closing<br>Assumable Loan: We assume this debt<br>Land placed into a LLC and we setup a equity share arrangement. We sell the LLC for $8,700,000.00 and we give the seller of the park, $1,000,000.00 from these proceeds.<br><br>The seller receives $11,000,000.00 total from the sale, which is equivalent to have received all cash anyway. <br><br>Out of the $7,700,000.00 balance, we do a DPO on the assumable loan, offering $500,000.00 for the debt and retiring it.<br><br>Of course the deal is contingent upon the values of both the park and the land proving out. I would go to California on a weekly basis and manage the deal and carry out all the initiatives to make the deal go as planned.        </p>

          Yes. We ignore these. Why? <br><br>Because these folks are looking to merely list their assets to have unsophisticated and inexperienced investors jump in and do all the brain damage of pricing these assets – only to say, “thanks, but no thanks”. <br><br>So, don’t be a sucker. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I got an email request that falls somewhat in a gray area so I&#39;m asking if we can do this. Its sort of grocery anchored, with NOI in line with the loan amount requested. If it was a string of dog kennels I would know the answer. But its borderline, so should I pursue this or decline:  <br><br>I&#39;m looking for $5 mil loan to purchase a package deal of 3 superamerica gas stations c/stores w/liquor franchises chain in Minnesota. The acquisition includes businesses with real estate.<br>The yearly gross revenue is $25 mil.<br>The net is $1.2 mil a year. after all the operating expenses, fees, the mortgages, the taxes and the pay roll are paid.<br>The market value of the businesses and the real estate is $7.5 mil<br>The stations can sale easily for $2.5 mil each.<br>I have 25 years experience in this Industry. I worked for oil companies managing the retail divisions. I also owned and operated similar businesses.<br>Our objective is to expand ,acquire more gas stations ,become a jobber ,sale fuel to other gas stations and dealers.<br>The loan will go directly to the seller(Oil company) to purchase this chain of gas stations.<br>Because of my Extensive Experience in this Industry The Oil company will put 20% for the down payment.<br>The Deal can be done one Gas station c/store at the time or the entire chain at once.<br>If you think you have the capability or what it takes to get me the other 80% of the Loan Contact me.        </p>

          Sal, <br>I recently had a visit to  my offices from a gentleman I once had a deal going with in Austin that Peter turned down. The deal was for a student housing project at University of Texas that turned into a development deal and it was not doable.<br><br>He asked me if we are still in the same boat of not funding student housing and I told him yes, we are not in the business of ground up development. He said look, we are ourselves now in a position of having to locate properties already built that are dated, acquiring these and out of our own resources, funding the rehab/conversion but we may be needing funding to acquire.<br><br>I informed him that we would enjoy working with him and his firm on this. he asked about fees and points and  I quoted him 65 to 70% first, remainder to be hard cash equity that is seasoned and verifiable. I told him that if he wanted to cross colllateralize with another asset that is free and clear, he can pledge that. I quoted him 12 to 14% interest, interest only, 1 to 3 year term, 1 to 3 points.<br><br>He asked if they can buy down the interest and I said we can discuss this once we have a live deal in front of us. I told him that I need a bio of all the principals including himself and a brief overview of the project, time frame for needing the funds, exact sources and uses, where their equity is coming from, and a deal sheet of previous student housing projects they have completed and who they have funded through in the past. I also provided a list of the five data points obviously without Dandrews identity listed.<br><br>He told me that they dislike their previous funders and are looking to establish a new source. I told him to get all this together and we will work the deal at that time.<br><br>Any additional information you need to see?        </p>

          On the previous go around, the deal was a ground up development deal. I wanted to be firm and let him know that if he wants to send deals where they want ground up monies, were not in that space. <br><br>If they have projects where they can acquire a property such as a multi family and convert it then send it. I find that  sometimes I just have to be firm. I have no interest in wasting Dandrew&#39;s time.        </p>

          Here is what they want to do. They want to acquire multi family properties that are available as a REO or in some level of near vacancy, acquire them, rehab them, using their own resources and then market them as student housing properties that are upscale.<br><br>They will charge a monthly rent on a per room basis. They are offering to possibly pay the first six months of debt service immediately after closing, so they get ahead of the game.         </p>

          Sal,<br>This just came over this morning. It&#39;s a tape I received an overview email on. It&#39;s a tape of loans. <br><br>Portfolio UPB: $3.4 M<br>Total # Assets: 89<br>Average Loan Size: $41,549.00<br>Interest Rate Weighed Average: 9.7%<br>Lien Position: First Position across entire pool<br>Collateral locations: Nationwide<br>Collateral Type: Residential 1-4 Family.<br><br>I took a page from your strategies on the Bulk Live Videos, which is to get a overview first, then if it&#39;s worth a looksie, then get the tape.<br><br>Here&#39;s where I think the play is at. It&#39;s all firsts, residential, small portfolio but still above the minimum $2M. The loan balances are not very high which signals a potential to be closed out fairly soon. There is the potential to get the loan refinanced to buy us out and there is a potential to offer a DPO to the payor. Are these viable impressions?<br><br>The one concern I have is the loan size of $41,549.00. The risk is that the property values will be low and that&#39;s why the average loan is what it is.<br><br>Once I get the tape, should I send it?        </p>

          Sal, a little clarification please regarding DIP. I am looking at Chap 11 on Pacer.gov and going to the individual cases. Open the attorney list and see the list of &#39;creditors and attorneys&#39; and &#39;debtor and attorneys&#39;. Sometimes under the listing for the debtor it will be &#39;debtor in possession&#39;. Does this mean that a DIP is already working?        </p>

          Sal,<br>One of the opportunities you&#39;ve helped a lot of us get into is the consulting business. The intellectual capital you&#39;ve provided has been tremendous in getting us in the door.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen a few here mention this a few times. My business has evolved more into that of a consultancy, really just on its own. It&#39;s been exciting, it&#39;s been challenging and I&#39;ve been documenting everything I&#39;ve been doing.<br><br>My struggle has been in pricing my services where I&#39;m getting fairly compensated for my work. I&#39;ve come up with a formula. Please provide some insight.<br><br>First, I have my exploratory call and client analysis. I&#39;m charging $500.00 for this, paid up front. This is a 1 hour job. I&#39;m essentially getting to know my client, what they want to accomplish, what they have done, their strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Next I have what I call financial tooling and re-tooling. This starts at $1500.00 paid up front and once this three hour time is exhausted, it&#39;s $250.00 per hour after. This is where I look at the deals they are doing, look at revenues, costs, losses, etc. I have an accounting degree, so this is stuff I know.<br><br>Next I have my Next Level Session. This is where we look at how they take a project to the Next Level. This is business, marketing and day to day operational plans. Did they source out funds yet, what did they say, did they put their best foot forward. We look at their chosen capital provider, can that provider actually fund their project, etc. This fee will be be $5000.00 with $2500.00 paid upfront, remainder 15 days later.<br><br>Now we move to Operation Deal. This is where we put together the five data points, the pitch book, marketing materials, financials, strategy for structuring the deal, put together the team which consists of financial, legal, compliance, brokerage, and others and we move forward.<br><br>I&#39;m charging  $10K for the pitch book alone and $15,000.00 for the remainder and of course im looking to craft in a equity piece if the project can support it.<br><br>My question is, am I charging too much, am I missing something?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I think one of the things that could be confusing those here is just what kind of deals can they submit. Good case in point would be the banker level submitting loan pools.<br><br>I think that saying look at the products sheets could be too general in nature.Another case in point. On the Structured products sheet, it says Land, however in order to submit those deals, you have to have purchased the Land Financier product. <br><br>A cheat sheet of sorts would be helpful, so those who really cannot submit those deals, will not waste their time as well as Dandrews. Any thoughts?        </p>

          Sal,<br>Wouldn&#39;t it be beneficial for those in the banker program to obtain a bio of the borrower as a standard operational protocol? I see the questions here about potential deals and your replies asking about the sponsor-operators experience with the type of deal they want to undertake.<br><br>I want to add this in for those reading this and trying to find their first deal. You will get many opportunities, especially if you have the credibility website. Many will never even be in your wheelhouse or Dandrews.<br><br>If someone is asking for a loan to buy an apartment building, has zero money for a earnest money deposit and has to call everyone in their family for the due diligence fees and the biggest deal they have done to date is a rehab on a triplex, chances of you getting this funded is slim. Its not even the monies needed, that issue can be solved with a partner, a JV structure, etc.<br><br>What cannot be overcome is experience. Look at it this way. You own a truck repair place and you need to hire someone and you get one person who interviews with you. If all they have done is car brakes at some quick repair place, are you going to hire them to repair diesel truck engines? probably not.<br><br>You have to not only qualify your deal, you also need        </p>

          Sal,<br>Many have asked me where I find companies with which to contact for opportunities. I use many resources, however, I do use a publication named Scottsman Guide.<br><br>They have a residential edition as well as a commercial edition. I use the residential edition to source potential sellers of loans. I get to see through their ads what they are lending on and this then triggers what types of assets they would possibly want to sell.<br><br>In the commercial edition, I can see through their ads of what they are lending on and determine if they may have commercial notes they want to move off of balance sheets, if they have funds that they want to finance out of that we can leverage, as well as other opportunities.<br><br>I thought I would pass this along. You can access this through Google, they have a digital edition online.        </p>

          Three quick Loopnet related questions: <br>1.I was asked by a broker I contacted through Loop net whether we do HUD loans or just cmbs. Any suggestions as to a response?<br>2. Since we are sourcing for acquiring property, what data points should we request from the broker, other than length of the remaining term the owner is willing to finance?<br>3. What is our exit strategy for these acquisitions?<br><br> Thanks again for the infographic.        </p>

          Sal, thank you. I spoke with the sponsor today and rescheduled for 9am Pacific time in the morning to do some research. I have been going through all the webinars and training from everything you sent me and trying to run my business from what you taught me. The DIP financing portion is part of my website and I don&#39;t have the funds right now to get what I need to know for the morning. Eventually I will get it. This deal is probably way out of my league but what can I do in the meantime to get prepared?         </p>

          Dexter: <br><br>No. Hard money lenders are not affiliated with banks. But sometimes hard money lenders get what’s called “*credit facilities*” from other banks. This is adding leverage to what they have. <br><br>For example, if a hard money lender has $5mm raised in investor equity, he can get a loan for an additional $5mm (or in good times $10mm). <br>So now for $5mm, he’s making points and fees and interest income on $10mm. What a wonderful country, right? <br><br>Except leverage can destroy you if you don’t know what you’re doing. And I’m here to tell you, Dexter, that many hard money lenders screw up operationally, and then blow up. <br><br>So, then if you’re thinking like your pal Sal, you go to the bank, offer $4mm for the defaulted loan secured against the $10mm portfolio, and foreclose and get $10mm worth of assets for…. You guessed it! $4mm. So we would add $6mm to our net worth because we leverage our brains. <br><br>Now, that’s what you call Grave Dancing. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I had a call today from a broker who actually put me onto a call with a seller. The first question I asked is are you the legal owner of the assets and do you house the files at your office or through a storage facility.<br><br>Most brokers don&#39;t even know what a storage facility is and what the significance of theses are. I was on the phone with the seller and I&#39;m getting the tape. The broker on this deal is his attorney who has a lot of expertise with note dispositions and trades.<br><br>Anyway, the broker said that he would like to partner with my firm on deals. He realizes just how funds dislike broker deals. His idea is he will locate the deals and screen the sellers and I bring the buyers to the deal and we split fees 50/50 after expenses.<br><br>I informed him that my capital provider and fund does not entertain broker deals and he said he meets with this resistance everywhere that he connects with real sellers.<br><br>My question I am guessing would be since deals would be coming from my firm technically and my partner and I are splitting the fees and points, would this in Dandrew&#39;s view still be a broker deal?        </p>

          James. <br><br>when we send you your incentives, anything you promised the other broker or 3rd party comes out of those proceeds. Not ours. <br><br>So if we send you a wire at close for 40K, its your responsibility to pay your referrals from that pool of 40K. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br>I wanted to be certain I can submit these deals to you. Every opportunity I feel is an opportunity to make money. I think this is a great way to bring about deals. I like JV&#39;s a lot.         </p>

          Dan, <br><br>This refers to Self Storage Facilities. These are really just cement slabs with steel doors that hoarders use to store their crap in for a monthly fee. <br><br>These were also over build duing the late 2000s when every doctor and accountant wanted to become a “developer”. So there is a supply and demand issue. Too much supply. Not enough demand. So the price goes down. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          So, I was doing some marketing today driving some traffic to my website that was made by Dandrew, and received an email from a potential client complementing me on my site! I&#39;m sure they would not have contacted me without it! If anyone out there has not purchased the website, get on it. You look like a rookie without it. <br>Thanks Sal!        </p>

          Real Estate Investing Conference New York City April 24:<br><br>Sal, I did attend today the NY City investor conference as an Exhibitor, and I had the opportunity to give my 2 min “Elevator Speech” (I was waiting for your help on that…I think you have forgotten about me); I was really impressed meeting investors who came not only from US, but from Europe, and Asia, just for this event! <br><br>The funny part of my NY city adventure was trying to sell my financial services to Ziel Feldman, the founder of HFZ Capital Group, who purchased the notes securing 303 East 51st Street, 20 West 40th Street, The Setai at Wall Street (40 Broad Street) and One Madison Avenue, as well as properties located at 11 East 68th Street and 11 Beach Street, all located in New York City. I did not know about him and his investing portfolios when I explained my Mezzanine $2 mil-$10 mil loans…but I had a very good laugh afterwards. <br><br>The interesting part to share with you is that the CEO of a capital creation company was looking for Equity Partners for a sky rise building in NY City. I told him that I was interested, and we exchanged business cards…more to come<br>        </p>

          Sal, I do take your concerns seriously. Although I feel pretty strong in analyzing commercial real estate deals, I am pretty weak in JV because I am a beginner in this area. As I said before I have many JV deals, and that’s why I need your help in guiding me here. Before I call the sponsor to ask the hard questions, I need to know what these questions would be, so thank you for clarifying that.<br><br>I was also sure that this was a Purchase JV, not a construction one, since the sponsor is using somebody else to pay for the construction expense; so as you see…it’s a learning curve. <br><br>I will get all the info you requested, but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s fair to use your time if you cannot benefit from this deal, but all you want is to help me, which is greatly appreciated. <br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I will benefit from this deal if it checks out to be a real, legitimate deal. Believe me. And so will you. <br><br>And if you need help on the JV stuff, go back and go through the JV Equity vs Fund Structures of the Private Equiteer program. That will make things much clearer for you<br><br>Sal        </p>
