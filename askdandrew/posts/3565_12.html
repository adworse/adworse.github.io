          Sal - I need to set up a NV LLC.  Was going to contact Fred at Hutchinson from one of the Triage modules.  But, I think you mentioned on last weeks call that you didn&#39;t want anyone contacting him anymore, or I read it somewhere.  Can I  still do this with him?        </p>

          Yes. you can. Of course you can. <br><br>What I meant from that comment was that people were calling Fred asking for free legal advice and he&#39;s not going to do that. <br><br>Call Fred and get the LLC set up pronto. 702-385-2500. Keep in mind to have your checkbook ready. If you can&#39;t get him, ask for his assistant Jeni Starley Nelson JStarley@hutchlegal.com. <br><br>He&#39;s helped a lot of Dandrew Intermediaries. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal-<br>Are lending parameters for DIP loans the same as the general parameters given to us, specifically the minimum loan amount?  I have a potential DIP requirement from an initial cold call to a BK attorney, but loan amount will likely be in the low to mid $1M&#39;s.  Thanks!<br>- Chris        </p>

          Sal-<br>Thank you for the response!  I will definitely ensure the asset is real estate.  I&#39;m following up with attorney to discuss further.  I will also be having a call this week with another attorney that told me that March is his busy month and may have several potential clients for me.  We may have found a great niche with DIP financing.<br>Thanks!<br>- Chris        </p>

          Don&#39;t know if this sort of thing would be of interest. I was contacted on Linkedin by an intermediary who says that she is direct to someone handling the disposition of a private pool reserve from four institutions. She mentioned Wells Fargo and Merrill Lynch as two. She states that the pool will be made up of $1.3 B of  class A, SFR, $700M of commercial and some notes, all in California. It was additionally stated that the facilitator has the ability to pull down assets that meet the parameters in a LOI as well. Is this something I should spend any time on?        </p>

          Thanks Sal. Understood. I tried that link and it brought me right back to this page.  I&#39;m just trying to figure out what the submission rules are and how to submit a deal. I called the help desk and did not receive a reply. This is non-deal, technical stuff, but it needs to be cleared up. For some reason, this is a problem for me. I can&#39;t find the info I&#39;m looking for here. This is usually not an issue for me, but it is here.  Thanks.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Some who are new may be struggling because they don&#39;t really understand what Dandrew is about and what the basis of the system is, so I wanted to give my take.<br><br>Sal and the guys are not a group of wealthy guys playing the game of commercial real estate for their own wallets. They are a real firm with two offices. They have overhead, employees, and they are a true Wall Street Investment Firm.<br><br>They invest other people&#39;s discretionary funds. The clients of the firm come to Dandrew because they know that their funds will be professionally invested and managed. They invest their monies into the various funds that Dandrew manages in house.<br><br>Why do these firms go this route? Because what they do is no different than what your own employer does with your 401K. Monies are invested into various funds with these funds chosen because each fund fits the clients investment philosophies. Some funds invest for the short term cash or they invest for the long term wealth, very much like being a real estate investor. You need quick cash, you buy a flip property or if you want long term wealth accumulation, you buy and hold.<br><br>The advantage you have in joining the firm as a Intermediary is that your capital provider is Dandrew and you don&#39;t have to strike broker deals with multiple firms like many intermediaries have to.<br><br>Dandrew makes their money from management fees, equity spreads, joint ventures with other firms, so my point is these guys work very hard. They are serious financiers and they expect each intermediary to be serious as well, this is why they have a credibility kit, serious profit center programs, a trading desk for each intermediary to add to their business.<br><br>This is real life, real Wall Street Business and those guys eat, sleep and breath this business and if you listen really well to what Sal says on the Friday calls, he vocalizes this, you just have to listen and hear.<br><br>You need to understand that once you enter the Dandrew World, you are expected to operate your intermediary practice as if you are a Wall Street firm. Your expected to work. Your expected to be serious.<br><br>Right now you need to ask yourself why your here. What do you want from this? If you are here to become super wealthy and become a jet setter, well than you probably won&#39;t see that happen, just because you want it to be. Those who go into a venture with that intention or goal rarely see it happen.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick observation on the distressed asset marketplace. I read an article at 5 am this morning where it is looking like overall market conditions for assets that are pooled are getting better, however, due to the amount  of commercial debt to the tune of I believe it was quoted at ten trillion dollars and counting is increasing, mostly because of those commercial property owners not being able to readily refi through convention banking channels, we are going to see a new wave of distressed assets entering the secondary markets.<br><br>It is like one drug dealer gets busted and off the streets and a new one takes over that guys market. This got me to really thinking, well not about the drug dealer occupation, but from a marketing standpoint, that every Intermediary here has a great opportunity to make a play in almost every asset class because instead of dealing with the financial institutions who hold the paper, we can now reach out to and appeal to those asset owners themselves who really have no chance of being kept from being any more upside down than they are or soon to be.<br><br>Any thoughts on this?        </p>

          I understand about submitting the entire deal at that web site.  But I thought you wanted only the 5 pts info first without all of the other details and then wait for your yes or no before submitting it all.  Is that right?          </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>Please explain a little further your inquiry today about what kind of money this client may have? Do you mean cash and liquidity or more about how much they have to make some plays with now? Also, as to what they don&#39;t like, is this discerning the asset classes they won&#39;t invest in or more so short or long play strategy. <br>They are open to both short and long plays depending on the deal. They are actively visiting/evaluating properties now...<br><br>Also, is there a document available to me here that effectively delineates the responsibilities and distribution of commissions for me an intermediary and a RE (resi) agent who&#39;s referring these clients to me? The agent is touring with one partner to show properties now... <br><br>Eric        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>A client is looking to make some initial plays in the US. They are Canadian and experienced w/ a portfolio there. They want to know the best vehicle/entity to invest through here. Do you recommend LLC or C Corp. or even S Corp or a combination of these that would be wholly owned by their parent corp in Canada?<br><br>Also they are wondering which strategy they should use to begin with. They&#39;re focused on multifamily, self storage and small strip retail. They and I are seeking to build a long term relationship here.They are asking me about non-recourse or portfolio loans... What direction would you offer?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Eric        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just some observations about the call today. First, as always, great information and great  call by you and AJ. I think people are missing one important caveat of Dandrew&#39;s business model, which is we lend on assets not buy them. I think if this can be wrapped around, there will less time spent pursuing deals that will not be looked at.<br><br>Another important thing to mention is that the more complex a deal the longer it will take to close. Naturally some deals take longer to close, and this is where deal management and heavy lifting come into play.<br><br>I think the question should always be asked when a Intermediary first looks at a deal is If I, meaning the Intermediary were going to invest their own money into a deal, would this be that deal.<br><br>Just a few thoughts.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a observation about being direct. I think some are not understanding what it means to be direct. This us for the new people. The only way you will get to be direct is to speak to and get your deal docs and answers to the five data points from the decision maker.<br><br>When someone is dealing with intermediaries and gate keepers, you will never get to be direct and please know that you can sign every NCND and NDA there is and you will never get close, unless your dealing with the real estate broker, attorney, CPA, etc.<br><br>You never want to deal with anyone who is not the decision maker, because what generally happens is you get someone else&#39;s interpretation of the deal details and no one can agree to terms except the decision maker.        </p>

          Good morning Sal:<br>I really need your help on getting the phone calls and emails scripts for calling banks and buyers that was promised three weeks ago during our coaching session as part of doing our homework. After many requests in the Dandrew community (as per your advice), we finally received a 2-page script, but it was for calling the brokers, not the banks, nor the buyers.<br><br>I have spent a large amount of money in building a credible business so I can be a serious player in the investing community; however, almost everybody we dealt with was requesting a LOI and Proof of Funds before engaging in any business relationship with us.  <br><br>In addition to creating a Commercial Real Estate Financing Club, I’ve purchased a list of the top commercial brokers in the 22 cities where Dandrew prefers to do business and blasted emails; the response is tremendous, and I am looking forward to great deals to come in our pipeline! The big issue we’ve experienced so far is that we cannot “show our money” to prove that we are able to “walk our talk”. Please help us with this issue that was discussed during our coaching call and it was also promised by you. You may or may not remember that we were asking for $10,000 instead of $5,000 and you said that you’ll see what you could do to help, so we are still waiting. <br><br>Thank you for your understanding and support.<br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I sent you scripts. What do you want changed to them. What is the ideal script you want. For banks? I can do that. Buyers? I can do that too. <br><br>Also, we&#39;re not going to be able to get a POF out to you for reasons that I&#39;ve communicated in the past. *This was never promised at all as a condition of membership or otherwise.* This is the boards decision, not mine alone.

          HI Sal, this is Dave Dean again.  I had a conference call with my realtor and the company that is doing the non-conforming notes. Here is what he said in a nutshell. Hopefully you can clear the mud for me. He said he is a business and not a broker of pools. They purchase notes that are 75% non-conforming and 25% REO&#39;s. They fix and flip the REO&#39;s and put the money back to the investors and re-work the non-conforming back to the homeowners. After 6 to 8 months of seasoning they re-sell the notes. They are getting there investors 300% returns. He wants to see a letter of intent and proof of funds and they will get the notes and do the due diligence at this time they submit to you the properties they picked. He is currently working a 12 mil project with a group in Utah and another in Florida. They let me know they don&#39;t comingle any assets and keep everything transparent. They like to work in the 2 mil to 20 mil range and can have the properties to show in around 2 weeks for them to do the due diligence work. I know you said let it go but the realtor has worked with this group before and asked me to present it again to you.        </p>

          CMBS Loans Follow-Up<br>Sal, thank you for your fast response; greatly appreciated! I need to clarify some of our discussion points, so we are on the same page;<br><br>I did not purchase a list of CMBS loans, but a membership to an Internet Provider of ALL Troubled Assets; I can assure you would be impressed about the amount of information provided (access to $8 trillion of commercial property sales, including financing and foreclosures, search for specific property, loan or investor attributes, explore 40,000+ company profiles for the players involved in each deal and much more). <br><br>Let me clarify now my question: Is the CMBS approach the best one for controlling a multifamily complex? The training claims that CMBS loans are “the ticket for building an empire” because the CMBSs have no commercial transactional funding. One can get full control without the associated liabilities, so I assumed it’s the best and maybe the easiest way to go, but I need your expert advice on this.  If you give me the blessing, then I will put some efforts in place to achieve this business goal. If you re-direct me to another strategy, please explain which the best way to go is. <br><br>I am not sure what you meant by “What you’re doing here is mixing 2 different strategies: buying (“Capital Formation”) and funding (“Capital Placement”), but you make an excellent point because the training video talks about both under “deal structuring”, and that was exactly my confusion and question about (it did not make any sense to assume a loan when one could just buy the shares).<br><br>Going back to what I would like to do with your help is : find a “qualified CMBS loan” in my cities of interest, make an offer to the owner to purchase the shares on his company, and close the deal.  I would also want to use Dandrew’s financing if I do not have enough capital for the shares’ purchase. Your thoughts on this? Go/No Go?<br><br>Thank you again for all your time spent with me. I am truly grateful.<br>        </p>

        <p>
          One of my business goals this year is securing a passive stream of income by controlling a multifamily apartment.  Going through the training materials, I concluded that the best way to accomplish this is to look at CMBS loans and buy the shares of the owner’s LLC; however, I am confused with the training video on Deal Structuring for Buying Stabilized Assumable Loans. Here are the steps from the video:<br>1.  Pre-Qualify the deal (5 points); Better if Stabilized; Debt Stack: CMBC<br>        *  Loans are assumable, but we must QUALIFY to assume a loan.<br>        *  Defeasance to consider as well, which would increase the payoff substantially<br>2.  When we find a deal we put it into a BK remote: cannot bankrupt the SPA.<br>3.  Work with an experienced attorney, not Title companies. <br>4.  Real Estate is held in a SPE (Special Purpose Entity) that is a LLC or LP<br>5.  The Seller (SPC) is a LLC that has a beneficiary, so is the buyer. The deal is structured such as the Buyer LLC (beneficiary) takes the place of the Seller LLC (beneficiary); we are switching chairs. Servicer does not know anything about the switch, so we should NOT pay 1% assumption fee. As a result, there is no commercial transactional funding…we go back door and SWITCH ownerships. We control the asset without ownership.  <br><br>Questions: Why should we go through the trouble of assuming a CMBC loan and risk failing the qualification as sponsors when we can go back door and buy the shares of the LLC and control the asset? What am I missing in the process? Were the first 1-3 steps informational only and step 4 is the one that we should really follow? If so, <br>would these be the steps?: (a) find CMBS loans, (b) qualify them, (c) submit the qualified deals to Dandrew, (d) call the owner, (e) propose a structured deal: need the script, and (f) submit the term sheet. I don’t usually run a business by feelings, however, “my gut” is telling me there is no logic in this step sequence.  Please advice.<br>        </p>

        <p>
          Fulga<br><br>First, this is great the steps you laid out. But, let me be clear here. You purchased a list of CMBS loans that you wanted to do something with. I didn’t advise you to do that. <br><br>However, with that said,  I’ve *never* traditionally assumed a first trust debt paying the assumption fee. That is just the bank’s way of trying to extort more fees from the borrower. Banks like to charge fees for no reason whatsoever. I know this, because we do the same thing. That is why we’ve never gone through the hoops of qualifying when we’ve assumed assets. <br><br>What you’re doing here is mixing 2 different strategies: buying (“Capital Formation”) and funding (“Capital Placement”). <br><br>So your questions might seem confusing at first glance, so here is what I would do following your lettering convention for *assumable loans*. <br><br>Remember, I only want you to be successful here. So this is why I’m taking the time to right-size this for you:<br><br>a.  Find *assets that have CMBS loans*. <br>These can come from listings and, sometimes LoopNet. Some deals you can find by using the keyword search *“assumable”*<br><br>b.  *Qualify them using the 5 Data Points*. <br>If the numbers make sense, make an offer for *you* to purchase. We don’t buy anything, remember we just fund things.  <br><br>c.  Submit the *pre-*qualified deal to Dandrew *for Sal to give his opinion only on via AskDandrew*. Remember, we don’t buy anything, we fund a lot of things. And if the debt is already in place, what do you need me for? <br><br>d.   Call owner. <br><br>e.  Propose deal structure after Sal has given his opinion. <br><br>Present the deal the way Sal has told you to present this deal. <br><br>f.  Submit the *LOI* to your buyer and see if he bites. <br><br>Regarding “feelings”, I don’t know what you mean, however, I think I clarified this for you. Remember, there is only so much “autopilot” you can do in this business as it still requires some face-to-face time. Would you have decided to buy anything from me if you didn’t get to know me over a 1.5 – 2 hour webinar? No. Same here. *Commercial deal makers know how to romance…* <br><br>And lastly, the scripts I’m working on will be emailed to you directly as you are a Virtual Coaching Member. Give me about 1 hour for that. It will be worth it and I’m sorry I didn’t get them to you sooner. <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Good to see you back at the helm. I wanted to pass on a strategy I have used for years to build a book of contacts in the commercial real estate space.<br><br>I go to the website www.cityfeet.com and I type in the city and state as well as select the asset class I want to search. I then look at each property advertised for sale. I then wrote down the brokers agency name, brokers name, phone number and email address if listed.<br><br>I then call that broker during day time business hours, which is very important to know, because you look much more professional when you call during business hours.<br><br>I introduce myself as follow. My name is James Balter, I am the CEO and Director of Capital Markets for JJB Capital Advisors. I am calling you today because I was once referred to you as someone who has clients who needc funding for commercial real estate opportunities.<br><br>When can we meet at your office to discuss doing some business. That is it, From there, the response is usually either, when are you available James, right now I do not have any clients who need funding but do you have a media package for your firm you can email me or I have a client or clients who really need funding and then its either lets meet today or tomorrow or I get to hear a country music song.<br><br>Either way, this is a system I have used for years and years, from my days of brokering notes in the early 1990&#39;s to today. Try it, it works.        </p>

          Hi, I sent a request a while back about a bank offering non-conforming notes in the Orange County area of California. I have a realtor who has the contact. I just spoke with her about the notes and they are offering them at 65% on the dollar. I just listened to the latest coaching call and your team seem interested in these kind of notes. Orange County is one of the most prime markets in california. I would really like your assistance and advice about these. The realtor would like to arrange a conference call so the bank could talk to you directly. The realtor informed me that these contacts have given other investors at least a 35% ROI. I am not familiar with this type of investing and would really appreciate your help with this. Thank you        </p>

          Sondra<br><br>It depends. Here&#39;s why. There are many people that provide leads but the real story is how credible are these leads. I&#39;ve seen many people pay for leads only to lead to crying.

          For the purpose of our business focus and efficiency, we need to better understand a line of the Submission Form /General question related on how would Dandrew participate in the deal: as a Purchaser or Financier.  Our question is: what type of assets is Dandrew willing to purchase? If an asset meets the stage 1 and 2 qualification points, is Dandrew willing and able to purchase the asset or there is a contingency in place (e.g. align another buyer)? <br><br>Thank you <br>        </p>

        <p>
          My questions are directly related to the 5-week live coaching calls and we need your help on clarifying topics related to our homework and its integration with the overall business strategy. <br><br>WEEK1: We briefly discussed the three bases for deals. Our homework was to find two cash institutional buyers for each of our cities of interest by using Google search. After two days of “searching REIT institutions” and making the appropriate calls, my assistant gave up because most of the info was obsolete, so it was obvious we had to change the strategy. During our first call we did not discuss the subject “Starting the marketing machine and putting your business on autopilot” we decided to define our own strategy and implement it the best that we could. We found a company that provides a detailed list of commercial real estate banks (decision makers’ info), but also a list of buyers who specialize in each deal type (multifamily, office space, student housing etc.). For us this was the answer for the topic “putting your business on autopilot”. Once we have detailed and accurate lists, we can make phone calls to develop the relationships needed. Since the SW can blast thousands of script emails to all parties, it also brings on board the “automation” side. We are also planning visits to small local banks so we can meet the decision makers on a personal level.<br><br>WEEK 2: During the entire 2nd coaching call we had the impression that we did not know what we were doing since we were critiqued as “being all over the place”; since we accomplished our homework 100% and much more, we were pretty demoralized and confused by your feedback. We also concluded that our interpretation of the “entire marketing on autopilot” was not aligned with your vision. With this in mind, please clarify what exactly the “start the marketing machine and putting your business on autopilot” is all about and what are the implementation steps. We will change our marketing strategy according to your recommendations. <br><br>Our week 2 homework was to make phone calls to small/private banks and submit deals to Dandrew. We are in the process of doing exactly so, but confused about this homework; dealing with Notes and REOs is like a stand-alone business, and we feel that we jumped to fast from one complex subject to another, without concluding the first one. <br>Is it possible to change the homework such that we find and submit deals from clients that need commercial real estate funding, so we don’t need to deal with buyers as well? Once we go over this process first, then we could handle deals that involve buyers and sellers. We have leads coming from LinkedIn, and we have a great SW provider, so this would be a logical step within the overall learning strategy. Please advise.<br><br>The last subject that needs clarification is related to all type of deals that need buyers. Since we are told to submit these deals without a buyer aligned, we assume that Dandrew’s team will look into their buyer list and try to sell the deal. Our question is what’s happening if nobody from Dandrew’s list is interested to buy?  Can we assume that we lose our commission and all the hard work with it?<br><br>Blog for 5-week Live Coaching Program: It would be great to have a blog for the program members, so we could share our work, ideas, and strategies that work and what don’t work and help one another to succeed in this complex but great business. I hope the program members would agree with me.   <br><br>Please help us with the Proof of Funds, Email and Mail scripts that were promised during the first call. We submitted the request again during the call, as you requested. <br> <br>Thank you for helping us to see the light through a huge forest. <br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>You will have that this weekend. As you know, but for everyone else, I have to travel for my day job sometimes for the deal business. <br><br>This requires me to be 100% focused on that end as that is how we make our money.

          On the fdic link to call banks with under 2 billion is assets- under other real estate owned- there is commercial and residential there. I have been getting my list together and have been only writing down the commercial amounts. Should I concentrate on only commercial at first and then ask about the residential? Also what is the minimum we should be targeting in dollar amounts. So far in commercial I am putting my cap on the low end at 1.5 million. Am I heading straight???? Thanks!        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick observation that was a result if a consulting meeting I did today. Your thoughts would be a welcomed help. I make additional revenues on real estate consulting assignments in the commercial sector.<br><br>A local limousine company hired me to source commercial locations for their expansion. I located several locations with each location having a different real estate company attached. In discussing what I do especially with my ability to bring capital to deals thanks to my relationship with Dandrew, one realtor said to me, gee do you realize you could make a fortune specializing in funding for warehouse and flex space deals.<br><br>My reply was I can arrange funding for these types of deals. My question is as follows. Should we look at specializing in a particular area?<br><br>I think there is a better chance to get more opportunities to make plays in lucrative deals if we specialize because we get to make markets as opposed to joining the party late.<br><br>What are your thoughts?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Yes.  Flex and warehouse - *in certain markets* - can make you a fortune. <br><br>That is true. <br><br>The limo companies: usually are good fronts for money laundering, so you know they are flush with some cash to pay you…<br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal, <br>I received your email about being out of the office. Thank you for that. I wanted to pass on something that I experienced today and it was a bad call. I wanted to pass this on as a glimpse of what a bad call is.<br><br>I received a call from a commercial real estate broker and they have a client who wants to buy in Detroit. I asked why and they said its a place with a lot of opportunity, and I said well I just don&#39;t see it.<br><br>They became very defensive and told me they grew up there. I asked what is the difference in population between now and this time last year. I mentioned the city has no available money to capitalize on any opportunity and that they were willing to mortgage their own baseball team just to afford to bills that are 180 days past due.<br><br>I clarified what I meant by not seeing opportunity which was that I do not see my capital provider willing to fund in Detroit.<br><br>They said that they are hearing this a lot and my question was well if you were lending your own funds, would you fund in Detroit? I then went into education mode. I explained that no private lender is going to want to place funds into properties with a NOI that was mediocre and with the city in the situation it is in, finding strong NOI&#39;s in properties was not going to be possible, right now.<br><br>I asked them if they had approached lenders in Detroit and they said no one would fund there. My question than was this. A local funder won&#39;t fund in their own city. I asked if this struck a chord with them?<br><br>They said I know nothing. I said well your incorrect on that because I understand true market conditions which in this case are not strong and not incentivized. I said as a commercial broker it&#39;s your job to sell the opposit of true market conditions.<br><br>My point in posting this is as follows. Know the markets your working in. Know what&#39;s going on, know the deals that are coming to town. Don&#39;t raise capital for deals in areas that are like Detroit. Logically, there is the argument that the city is depressed so there are opportunities, however, in reality, when a city or area is as depressed as a Detroit, even the prime opportunities are not prime.<br><br><br>        </p>

          James: <br><br>Let me bottom line this for you: <br><br>*If this was your entire life savings, would you invest with this guy in Detroit because he brow-beat you and was from there?*<br><br>*Sal&#39;s Rule: Always look at the numbers dispassionately. When emotion gets into an investment, that is how you get fleeced.*<br><br>Good dialogue and thanks for posting here. It seems like you - and hopefully the community here - will learn from this. <br><br>And, brokers will never have an alignment of interest with you ever. Never take advice from someone who doesn&#39;t have some skin in the game. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          5-Week Live Coaching Status Report as of Feb 27, 2014 <br><br>We are in the 3rd week of coaching, and after giving a serious consideration on how to set-up this complex business and run it efficiently I’ve came up with a general strategy shared below. The credibility kit helps a lot, however, there is so much more to be done and so many questions to be answered. I am learning this business as fast as I can, while implementing a strategy that makes logical sense to me.  To accomplish this we identified first all our players who request a commercial loan, those who want to sell and those who want to invest: small banks, brokers, title companies, attorneys etc. The next logical step was to identify the best SW provider that have the “ready to go” lists for all our players and capable to use the email blast feature. One step further, is be able to identify a buyer for each specific deal available for sale. Here is the additional work associated with the implementation of the marketing plan. Pease note that in the absence of a direct guidance, we were facing a lot of “trial and error”.<br><br>1.  Website: We were working on improving the website to cover the entire business. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and PPC (pay-per-click) will be implemented as soon as we have clarity on the marketing budget. <br><br>2.  Social Networking/LinkedIn: we were getting too much garbage, so our new strategy is (a) to create and manage two specific groups (one for financing and one for investing) and (b) upgrade our membership to Executive where we can use “In Mail” feature that guarantees responses. For $87/month we can send 25 email/month. Our goal is to send emails to all “Chief Credit Officers” from the banks of our choice; according to LinkedIn, they have to respond if they have the same membership. <br><br>Note: So far we received about 500 emails via LinkedIn and website: about 90% solicitations are selling leads, 2% need financing and one is a tape. We are still qualifying them. <br><br>3.  Phone calls to small banks: We compiled a small database with info for all banks in Austin, Huston, Dallas and Son Antonio with total assets smaller than $500 mil, who also have “Other Real Estate Assets” due by 90 or more days. We made about 15 calls. Since we did not get the promised script from you, we created our own as follows: “ Hi, I am Fulga Iancu, from DCP capital in NY. We are a principal buyer of commercial real estate products. I want to speak with someone in your loan sale department to see if they have any commercial real estate assets that need to be removed from the balance sheet.” We were always transferred to the “Chief Credit Officer” line, but got the voice mail, and left the same voice message, with minor exceptions. From 15 calls, we could reach one chief executive officer who was very pleasant, but unfortunately was not able to work with us due to “regulation issues”. <br><br>4.  Business/marketing on autopilot. Status: we identified the Internet SW provider with info about buyers, sellers, investors, and even more find the buyer for each type of asset. Since is very expensive, we need to work on the budget allocation first before committing to one year membership. <br><br>5.  Building relationships: Not done yet! We will make personal phone calls on a daily basis to our potential clients and keep records of the phone conversations with follow ups. The book deal is a good start, but there are great CRMs (customer relationship management) that do a pretty good job in managing the client relationships). I am fond of personal visits to regional small banks and get face to face with the decision makers. <br><br>It is obvious that implementing the marketing plan and putting the business on autopilot takes time and money. What I did so far in a short time is my personal interpretation of how to accomplish this task required by Day 1 coaching Infographics.  I am looking forward to hear your opinion on this and provide us some tips that would help us do better.<br><br>Lesson Learned and What We Need:<br>1.  Creating a Good and Efficient Marketing Plan, and putting in on autopilot is a very complex task. This subject is included in Day 1 coaching Infographics. I am looking forward to hear your opinion on this and provide us some tips that would help us do better.<br>2.  Using Google search to create the buyer list is inefficient and time consuming.<br>3.  Thomas-Law website did not work for us.<br>4.  We need the Proof of Funds that was promised during our first call and the phone/email scripts for calling the banks.<br>5.  We would appreciate your help during tomorrow’s session by your calling banks to listen to your “speech”; here is a small list that have commercial assets that are “due” more than 90 days. <br>6.  Anything else that you do not approve from what we are doing, please re-direct. Any tips that would help us to be more efficient and to do better would be greatly appreciated. <br><br><br>Bank  Location  Telephone #<br>Western Alliance Bank Phoenix, Arizona  602-389-3500<br>Plains Capital Bank Dallas,Texas  214-525-9100<br>Southwest Securities, FSB Dallas,Texas  214-859-5200<br>Texas Capital Bank, National Association  Dallas,Texas  214-932-6600<br>North Dallas Bank &amp; Trust Co.

          Molly, <br><br>You tell them that you’re an *institutional capital provider* and that you are not an individual retail investor. <br><br>What this really says is behind the scenes, the sponsor isn’t used to dealing with sophisticated, institutional investors and has relied on ma-n-pa investors to fund their deals. <br><br>Great question! <br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Molly, <br><br>Great question. This is the *story* behind the deal. What happened to it? This is the asset for sale? What needs to happen to make it perform better (the *”key event”*). <br><br>Usually, when hearing the problems that the “Bad Operator” had with it, we call that the “Country Music Story” (non-technical term, Sal’s term). <br>This could be anything from “out of town owner”, to “owner paid too much for it”, to “loan coming due”, health issues, etc. <br><br>Of course, you never really believe what you’re told first, as people will only tell you what *they* want you to hear, so you’ll need to be a jealous ex and dig deeper. That is my secret tip. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Hi Sal, this is Dave Dean again, my realtor sent me a powerpoint presentation and the excel spreadsheet on the deals. She wants to have you and the group have a conference call before they release the tapes. I don&#39;t know why the would hold them back. Let me know what you want me to tell them, I don&#39;t want to waist your time either. <br>Thank you        </p>

          I have been networking with commercial buyers who are used to having to find the deal then raise funds using SEC guidelines.  I don&#39;t make the income YET but I have a great deal of education in regards to investing and I am sure our hedge fund investors are sophisticated. Can you go over how we should be following these guidelines and answer questions regarding sophisticated investors?         </p>

          These people are syndicators. They buy one-off deals this way. They use *retail* money. <br><br>We don&#39;t. we use *institutional* money. I think this would be better explained on next week&#39;s conference call.         </p>

          I am working with an  Attorney here in Dallas who has given me information on a Dallas area La Quinta and a Super 8 that are in Chapter 11. He has given me the name of the BK attorney to contact but wanted to know if I knew of anyone who would want to buy one or both before I contact that attorney. The entity that owns these owes his firm some money. His firm does not represent the owner in the BK and he would like to work with me to find someone to purchase these where he could represent the purchaser. <br><br>He originally contacted me about refinancing $4mm in mortgages on these hotels.<br><br>If you or anyone you know would be interested in more information, please contact me through www.jsdcapitalpartners.com or www.linkedin.com/in/jsdeweese        </p>

          Hi my real estate contact has a bank with non-conforming notes in the Orange county Ca area. The group is offering them at 65% ROI and would like to have a phone conference with you about them. Are you open to a conference, I have no idea what to ask for on this type of investment.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Its 0335 am in Arlington, Texas. I&#39;ve already did my morning run, walked the dogs and I am about to sit and read the Bloomberg from yesterday as well as The Wall Street Journey and its on to business, yes business on a Saturday.<br><br>I wanted to reflect on yesterdays call a bit and usually my comments are really for the new people. It wasn&#39;t long ago that I was new here and I know how it is to struggle with something.<br><br>Someone asked about motels and my mother owned a motel in Edison, NJ from the time I was three until I was 17. Motels are generally not high income generating by single facility. When you have a chain such as a Motel 6 or a Super 8, where your a corporate entity operating a volume business, meaning you have 30 doors plus per single operating facility and over 100 total facilities, than your earning revenues that can be significant.<br><br>Here is the link to a publication about how hotels and motels are valued. The link is: http//www.hvs.com/content/971.pdf.<br><br>Someone also asked where do I get started, what do I do. This is normal. First thing you do is locate a client and obtain answers to the five date points.<br><br>You go to www.DandrewDeals.com and you complete the submission form and submit it. Now instead of waiting for Sal or one of The Dandrew team to get back to you, be pro active and make contact with the client and simply say, &quot;Mr/Mrs/Ms, my funding team is reviewing the initial information you provided to determine if we can fund your deal where it is a win-win for everyone. I expect to have a preliminary answer for you in the next 24 to 48 hours, however, I have some additional questions for you, do you have some time to further discuss your deal?&quot;. <br><br>Now this is where you are going to move onto the Phase 2 questions that are in the banker program and after you obtain the answers to the questions, you than thank them for their time and you simply end the call by saying, &quot;If we are ready to move forward, what would be the turn around time for you to get together the documents we would need? if they ask which documents, just simply say, At this point, we have all we need, I will know what particular documents we would require, once I have been informed that we wish to move forward.<br><br>Now, most will begin asking about points and fees and your answer better be, Sir/mam, until I know we are going to want to move forward, I am not in a position to discuss that. Now here is something very important to say. &quot;If I were to quote you fees and the such right now, I may be incorrect, however, most deals are 75% of the appraised value, 2 to 3 points, 1 to 3 year term, 10 to 14% interest, with interest only payments monthly, with principle and remaining interest payable at the end of term.<br><br>You want to get to know these terms and be able to say them where it does not sound like your reading off a rate sheet. It has to come from you in an authoritive tone of voice.<br><br>One more tip. Always control your deal. Have a deal sheet setup for each deal. This is important as it begins a paper trail for each deal. Keep deal specific notes to include dates, times, who you discussed something with. If your clients admin, Shirley tells you the boss is out of town only to receive a terse email from your client, you can reply back with, Sir, Shirley informed me on Friday of last week, that you were out of town and out of pocket on receiving emails.<br><br>Anyway, these are just my observations and some things I wanted to pass on to the new people who have all the great tools at their disposal and wonder what next.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          As a follow up of our phone call today, please advise if you are interested in a phone conference with my contact (authorized asset assignees) representing 148 banks for the purpose of liquidating the commercial assets in bulk transactions. My contact is hired by the banks to qualify purchasers for the banks&#39; assets through the liquidation process. The program is strictly confidential. The assets are highly discounted  for a quick sale. Minimum purchase is for $250 mil cash. These assets are not distressed properties, but performing. They are not offered for sale through the banks, only through the assignees who are paid by the selling banks. They can work only principal to principal. <br>This may be a great opportunity and I believe we need to act quickly. If you are interested, we could set up a conference call for Monday; if not, please let me know as soon as you can, since I am interested to talk to other principals before is too late.<br><br>Thank you and am looking forward to your  response.<br>Fulga        </p>

          Sal,<br>The call today is still ongoing in the Q and A right now, and I wanted to say great call and the updates to what&#39;s coming is exciting.<br><br>I was looking at the Ofree Website and a thought came to mind. Couldn&#39;t Dandrew IM&#39;s make a market niche for themselves by working with Joint Ventures in commercial real property ownership where one partner wants to get out for any number of reasons, but none the less wants out .<br><br>On a deal like this, would the biggest obstacle to getting a deal done be the remaining partner not wanting to sign off on the deal or would it be the percentage of ownership the selling partner has and how do you price a deal like this?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a call this week with a firm that buys pools of NPN, PN and Re-Performing notes. Quick questions, on the Re-performing notes, the fact that they added the delinquent balance onto the back end of the note, does that make more valuable or less valuable. More valuable in terms of the over all yield increasing and less valuable because it was already delinquent. In reality all they have to go by is someone&#39;s promise they will straighten up and fly right.<br><br>My next question is that isn&#39;t it required so as to not violate SEC rules that the very first meeting or call cannot discuss specific business as there must be a previous business relationship created before discussing money?        </p>

          Could not find right place to ask this question- hope it is appropriate for here. On credibility kit- on Lending Parameters- it says origination loan is 2-3 points. But when we talk to owners/operators we are telling them 4 to 6. Is there any way to change this to 4-6 points on website? This could cause problems when negotiating to get term sheet out. Thanks        </p>

          I have a Buyer of a 5-Hotel portfolio in the Eagleford Shale region of Texas. The assets were recently appraised for $55.0M and the purchase price is $42M. The existing NOI is $19M. I have an entire dropbox including all P&amp;L&#39;s since inception in 2012. The Buyer is the current Management Team with a net worth of approx. $50M. I have a CMBS Lender considering the permanent financing as we speak, but MAY NEED a Bridge Lender.<br><br>How can I submit the dropbox to Dandrew for your consideration. Thank you. Ed M        </p>

          Sal, as requested and promised, here is the link to the Bloomberg article I sent over to you. I will give you my insight into where I think the play is going to be. <br><br>*The link is http://bloom.bg/1b3UpSh .*<br><br>The play for this is going to be in the smaller markets outside of the Tier-1 Cities such as Tier-2 Cities and those areas with a MSA of 500,000 or more.<br>These big white elephant firms are looking to position themselves into Tier-1 cities even if they say they consider plays in smaller cities because if they have an opportunity to buy a class B asset in a class A area, for them it&#39;s a major score and they look brighter in the eyes of those institutional investors that capitalize their funds.<br>The play is also going to be those smaller size assets/deals in the investment range of Dandrew. The bigger firms are not looking at the smaller deals as they are geared towards the larger properties that were trading in the hundred million dollar sector when market conditions were in its hey day.<br>There is going to be a demand for properties that are in the lower price points that over time will go up in value faster than the higher priced properties. Because these firms are buying where they are at price ponies wise, they are leaving no room for the value add component to come into play.<br><br>If I&#39;m paying $50,000,000.00 for a property even though it&#39;s still a great deal versus what it was trading for historically and it&#39;s in a Tier-1 and your paying $18 million for a similar property in a Tier-2, your in a much better value add position because you have a market location that may go up in value faster and your investment has greater potential to grow significantly.        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>I have a question for you. Have bank balance sheets healed and recovered from the financial crisis? I found this recent news article on National Real Estate Investor that is of the opinion that it has &quot;largely healed&quot; (Anderson, 2014):<br><br>&quot;You might not think of commercial banks as a prime source for longer-term loans—but seven-year terms have become common for commercial mortgages provided from the balance sheets of banks eager to lend, especially on multifamily properties. “Banks are very aggressively out there and bidding on loans,” says Michael Riccio, senior managing director for CBRE Capital Markets. Bank balance sheets have now largely healed from the financial crisis. Also, new banks regulations go ...&quot; (Anderson, 2014)<br><br>If this is true, how will this affect the market for balance sheet solutions; and would this require intermediaries to adjust business development strategies to the new market reality?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Suzette<br><br>References:<br><br>Anderson, B.

          Great article, Suzette. <br><br>However, this is in a trade magazine, which is like reading articles on the best mutual funds in Forbes, turning the page and seeing that the advertisers are Fidelity and Vanguard. <br><br>Or like Miami real estate brokers telling you Miami is a hot market right now because the uber-luxury condos are being bid up. But they&#39;re not telling you that it&#39;s foreign oligarchs buying these to park their money because the NAR doesn&#39;t have a &quot;know your client rule&quot; so Saddam Hussein could buy one if he was alive today. <br><br>Not indicative of what is really going on. <br><br>My issue with this today is as follows: yes banks are lending. The problem is that few commercial banks will make commercial real estate loans in excess of 58% to 63% loan-to-value today.  Even if you could convince a bank to make you a loan of $1,575,000 (63% of $2.5 million), the proceeds of the loan won&#39;t be enough to pay off your $1,950,000 existing first mortgage. <br><br>So rest assured, private capital (preferred equity and mezzanine) will still be as useful as water is to a fish. <br><br>Always read between the lines. Stay cynical. Be paranoid at worst. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I live in the Dallas area and there are banks here that will make you a commercial loan as long as you have 30 to 40 % of your own equity to pledge to the deal. They also want to tie up the deal for 45 to 60 days.<br><br>Our USP or Unique Selling Proposition is that we are deal makers who don&#39;t make a borrower wait months to maybe get a deal done, probably not. There is the argument from borrowers that our interest rate is not low, the reply is this is not 2007 anymore. The next argument is going to be that they can get a lower interest, lower points and a higher LTV elsewhere. The reply is is that a true LTV or is it LTC? How much lower interest rate and points and they will often tell you and the reply is that if they could have done that, they wouldn&#39;t be entertaining doing business with us and they would have already signed off on the term sheet.<br><br>The best argument for our interest rate is high is well if you can get 10% elsewhere versus our 13%, what&#39;s the trade off? Wait upwards of 60 days to save 3% points that are being paid for by the properties income not the sponsor-operators wallet anyway.<br><br>I find that you have to help a sponsor-operator be able to justify doing business with us. I always use the a Doctor Analogy when someone says that they can walk into a bank and get a loan. The analogy is as follows. I know a very financially strong doctor who has a credit score of 800 and he couldn&#39;t obtain a mortgage loan so while you may be able to go in and apply, there&#39;s a good chance you will not get a loan, so we are your best chance in today&#39;s market and I always ask, does this make sense.        </p>

          Jimmy<br><br>I see the USP. But I want you to think of the risk. <br><br>*Sal&#39;s Rule: The risks are always more asymmetric than you think.* <br><br>The reason why I&#39;m able to cultivate capital - *on demand* - in most cases is because I have a reputation of thinking through the risks first that I use to pre-qualify the deal/play before I raise captial around it. <br><br>What can go wrong. How do I manage it. Once I figure that out, my conviction in the deal is must stronger and hence, for lack of a better term, so to is my &quot;passion&quot; for communicating that to any investor. <br><br>I think that if you look at in Private Equiteer &quot;Sal&#39;s Live Pitch&quot; tab, you&#39;ll see that. <br><br>If I was reading from a teleprompter, what would that say about my conviction in the deal. I don&#39;t mean conviction means &quot;hype&quot;. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          The risks are always going to that the debt will not be repaid as agreed and that the value of the asset will go down in value based upon the market conditions, leaving us with an asset that if foreclosed upon, would not allow us to recover the principle.<br><br>One of the biggest problems I see in the Dallas market for example is with big box retailers expanding into an area of town where for example, there is a strip mall that may have a clothes store, a restaurant, a mom and pop pharmacy with a small well established Hispanic grocery as the anchor tenant.<br><br>All along, for years, the owners of the strip mall saw huge rental Incomes come because the leases were structured as a nnn deal, and the stores were riding high due to huge market share, however, when Wal Mart and Sams Club moved in, all of a sudden, the tenants saw a huge decline in revenues, they couldn&#39;t afford rents and utilities, marketing dollars declined, and the businesses shut their doors one by one and this great nnn structured deal all of a sudden became like a straight rental situation. <br><br>No new stores were lining up because no one wants to try to run up against Wal Mart and Sams. I believe if we structure the terms of the loan carefully, we require more equity in the deal thus eliminating the amount of monies lent and we build a term sheet around the concept of turn over the deed in lieu of foreclosure, we eliminate the time involvement to go through the foreclosure process and cost.<br><br>If we manage client expectations well from the start, we all enter into this deal with a firm understanding of the terms of the deal, we cross collateralize with an asset that is free and clear, we have a second asset we can take that off sets any potential losses and actually makes the deal profitable.<br><br>We sell both assets as a package deal and increase our yield because were co mingling a strong asset with a weak asset, beefing up the value of the deal to a new owner. We take a equity stake in the new deal that gives us extra protection.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is a portion of the REO Report I just emailed you. I wanted to post it so those here can see where the opportunities truly are.<br><br>While the top 5 banks still own most of the non-performing debt and REO there continue to be thousands of local, community, and regional banks carrying and disposing of these distressed assets.<br><br>One of the big opportunities for 2014 is going to be the small balance distressed commercial real estate notes and properties with smaller lenders.<br><br>During the boom the smaller banks went long into construction and local commercial real estate lending because it was impossible for them to compete with the larger residential lenders.<br><br>Now as regulators turn up the heat on our nation’s smaller banks, strangling them with the burden of increased regulations, it has become even more important for them to shed their most criticized non-accrual and the easiest place for them to do that is in their commercial portfolio.<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick comment about The Perfect Storm. This should be a resource in every IM&#39;s tool chest. It is in my opinion a worthwhile 119 page booklet.<br><br>I fully understand what&#39;s it purpose is however there is lots of valuable information in it for anyone to read. I really appreciated the candor in the section in why Dandrew needs us. It sheds light on the subject.        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Based on all the education I received from you, I&#39;ve been asked to participate on a residential development in San Antonio, Texas.  I know you&#39;re not a fan of residential development at this time.  The Principal has asked me to participate as a &quot;money manager&quot; and make sure everything gets paid and on-time; nothing gets &quot;mishandled&quot;.  His plan is to develop affordable housing near a military base.  Do you mind if i email the executive summary?  Perhaps I can convince him to develop a better project.  He already has the private investor lined up to commit the money.  They plan to meet in Houston sometime next.  I know both parties (Principal and Investor/lender) and I want to make sure they have a &quot;realistic&quot; chance of developing something that will succeed.  Perhaps they can hire you as a consultant or maybe you can point them in the right direction.<br><br>Thank you,<br><br>-Rick        </p>

          Rick<br><br>First that&#39;s great. Why do they have to hire me. I have enough stuff on my plate! Tell them to hire you!!!<br><br>I&#39;ve been in guru hell for the last 6 months setting up our website and then after that I have to set up a tax lien trading desk in Las Vegas. <br><br>I think you should think about spending some *quality* time with me in the champagne room after you get your invectives buttoned down.  <br><br>However, before you do that, I will tell you that you need to do a lot of due diligence on the military base as they can close quickly. <br><br>*In my humble opinion - and I&#39;m one guy - so this is my opinion*, this Presidential Administration has and continues to show a cold shoulder to the armed forces and the men and women that protect our country. So there is a lot of &quot;political risk&quot; in these deals. <br><br>I&#39;ve seen developers and operators decimated and bankrupted soon after a base closing when they thought the bases would be permanent fixtures like Mount Rushmore in their towns.  To the point that he was begging a few friends and I to buy his Bentley Continental for a song (I was in NYC at the time otherwise I would have). <br><br>Let me know how I can help. <br>Sal        </p>

          Sal &amp; Rick - Rich Dusek Here - while I generally agree with what Sal is saying about military spending, I have devoted a good bit of time to understanding San Antonio and the military housing market.  Ft. Sam is a BRAC winner and is (I believe) the largest medical training facility in the US.  With Lackland, Ft. Sam, etc. I believe that this is a good development market.<br>I would like to see the Exec Summary and see if I can be of value to the op - please email info to rich@duseknetwork.com        </p>

          Sal,<br>I reviewed your reply to my fund formation question but did not see where I could reply, so I wanted to answer the very good questions you posed which I did take into account.<br><br>First, the funds monies are always protected because the sponsor operator would not be given a blank check so to speak, the funds would be placed into escrow and held until certain caveats are performed such as end buyer providing their funds to close on the B-C transaction whether the closing date is 24 hours or 30 days from close of escrow for the A-B transaction.<br><br>The funds attorney would handle all legal including filing suits if need be and the costs for legal would be born out of the funds operating capital. The losing party would reimburse the fund<br><br>The earnest money would be held in escrow until the close of the A-B and the funds monies would not be in jeopardy because it would always be in the closing segments hands until the deal closed. If the deal does not close, all monies advanced by the fund would be returned.<br>The fund would be given a equity stake in each property or note/note pool until the monies were repaid, this way, in the event extended transaction funds came into play as opposed to 24 hour short term and not repaid, the fund would foreclose on the asset or assets and liquidate to return to the investors their monies.<br><br>The mission of the fund is to make available commercial real estate secured short term to medium term investment opportunities where the investors money is always working and generating returns on a daily to monthly basis as opposed to the stock market or hard money lending which ties up an investors money for six months to twelve months gaining interest only monthly payments . <br><br>Through my fund, they are receiving one check that reflects profits from multiple closed transactions monthly thus generating a higher return on investment.         </p>

          It would be about 30 days. There isn&#39;t a such thing as a 24 hours close in commercial; the grown-ups live in this realm and its caveat emptor. Not like residential where a Realtor&#39;s license or brokerage is on the line. <br><br>How would the fund foreclose if it is just providing earnest money? There is no ownership? You mean if held in an LLC? Foreclose on the membership interests? <br><br>You may be onto something here - albeit some would consider predatory - and only the marginally experienced real estate investor would do this out of some form of desperation. I&#39;m not saying its wrong, there is a cost to everything.  <br><br>Get back to me on this.         </p>

          Sal. I&#39;m reasonably new to your program but not to the business. Would you ever consider investing in a late-stage start-up without real estate as collateral? There is other collateral available, such as warrants in the public company and payments on existing contracts. Furthermore, the exit strategy is fairly straight forward within 120 days. The $900,000 required investment gets them across finish line for their pilot plant, which by contract, triggers funding from a group named Ventrillion in the amount of $11,000,000. They just need to get to the finish line. $2.6M of their own money has already gone into the plant and another $4M has gone into the business. Very large contracts pending. Thank you. Ed M<br>         </p>

          Sal,<br>As you are aware I am shortly going to be elevating myself to the Private Equiteer level with Dandrew within a few weeks with this being a very exciting time in my career. My goal as you know from our previous conversations is to be a fund manager.<br><br>In your very valued opinion what is the viability of a fund that provides transactional funding monies to experienced sponsor operators in the commercial sector, with the food groups being multi family and notes?<br><br>This would be short term funds with the max term being 180 days or less, thus allowing the fund and its contributing members to turn their monies every six months, thus earning a higher yield versus putting their monies into longer term investments.<br><br>Would the unique selling proposition be the short term higher yield opportunities or would it be to become involved with commercial opportunities without having to acquire properties.<br><br>As always, thank you for your time        </p>

          Sal,<br>As you know transactional funding companies direct their marketing target demographic at residential single family 1 to 4 unit property types putting up 100% of the funds to acquire plus closing costs for generally a 1 to 3 day period for generally 2% fee plus a processing fee to cover soft costs. They say they do commercial but you never see anything geared toward this. You can&#39;t blame them, they are small deal market makers for the most part.<br><br>My idea is to do do a special situation type equity fund using the transactional funding model, where the sponsor-operator would have an investment, say a multi family that they can acquire from a bank for lets say 45 cents on the dollar, quickly clean up and quick turn to a multi family investment company for 65 cents on the dollar.<br><br>They would keep the money out for lets say 56 days at 8% as an extended transactional funding . The makeup of the sponsor operator is that they have done 2 or 3 small deals, no joint venture partner readily available because the track record just is not there, they have a small network of buyers who want the sponsor-operator to take title first as opposed to the end  buyer having to do all the heavy lifting and not wanting to buy the deal as a result of a referral, in other words, they want the sponsor-operator to work the deal.<br><br>The sponsor-operator would never get past the vetting by Dandrew or most reputable capital providers. The fund would place the acquisition monies plus closing costs into escrow like any transactional funder does, have their monies constantly working over many deals. The sponsor-operator would use their own funds to get the deal ready for the end buyer to come in.<br><br>The fund would receive back the principle plus fees. The fund investors would receive a premium on their money over a mutual fund investment because their monies would be moving in and out of deals monthly and weekly as opposed to letting the monies ride in the stock market on the stable one day unstable the next roller coaster called the stock markets.<br><br>Is something like this viable in your opinion?        </p>

          I see this. I&#39;m starting to dig deeper here asking you questions: <br><br>What guarantee is there that the earnest money won&#39;t go poof? Meaning seller will find a reason to keep it. <br><br>Who is going to pay for litigation costs if this happens? <br><br>Think more about the risks and how you will structure the risk away from your investors as they come first and foremost. <br><br>How to you manage the risk for this here? <br><br>(And its &quot;princi*pal*&quot;, as in your pal, Sal...)<br><br>Sal        </p>

          I joined as a private equiteer . How come there is no mention of this in here? I am studying on ask dandew site and am on module 3. When I signed up I got 4 websites and 4 passwords but wanted to have a system where I was not going all over  the place. Should I stay with the modules and then move to other sites like fundraising fund., reo bulk, etc??? Thoughts? Thanks........        </p>

          Go through the Triage. Then the Arbitrager (Bulk REO), then the Private Equiteer (JV vs Fund Structures). In that order.         </p>

          You guys mentioned a residential pitch book in the training. Or am I confused? As a side note, it would be great to have access to a list of qualified sponsors and operators for each type of asset. I am running into folks that have an asset but not a qualified sponsor or operator. The reason they are not stabilized... Thanx        </p>

          That would be great to find one. Let me see if the data company I use can get some of these for us. It won&#39;t be cheap, FYI. <br><br>And the pitchbook should be in Fundraising Fundamentals. Is it not there?         </p>

          I have looked for the picthbook on residential and can not find it. The web site is easy to navigate so I either do not understand what I am looking for or it is not there. <br><br>As an opportunity, I talked to two different folks today that may want me to do a deck for a 10M raise. Obviously I have the template and clearly understand that specificity gets you funded but will need help with this. One is in Vegas and the other in Houston. How do I get your teams help to get me through this 1st deck. I have watched everything and reviewed everything and have done decks in other verticals but not for funding. Everything I have done, although similar process... was to get large projects funded for fortune 50 companies. I guess what I am saying is I feel comfortable with the strategy and process but not the content. Thanx again for the education and your time as both have been invaluable. I will have my marketing material from the cred kit this week and the web site is up and running. I also have tradedesk@wasahadcapital.com up and running.<br><br>On the deal I submitted we do not have all the pieces yet which is why I have not done any follow up with your team. I have heard you load and clear on having the right info and not to waste peoples time with the wrong info or asset class.<br><br>Thanx Again,<br><br>Dan        </p>

          Sal<br>Looking for buyer for property in Maryland. A short sale. This property is utilized as an assisted living facility with potential for  creative value adds. It is located in Columbia MD at a prime location. I am dissolving the ALF business and the property will be vacant soon. 3700 sq ft.10 BR and 4 BATHS on 1 acre. Savvy investor could get a good deal.<br>It can be a multifamily. Is there funding available to convert to  regular multi unit housing? This would be my first preference.<br><br>Thanks        </p>

          Quick comment about Linked In. If someone is trying to connect with an asset manager and gets to talking with them about doing business, they are going to ask you for a proof of funds and a LOI to get anywhere with them.<br><br>You must reinforce that your not a buyer, you are a funding resource for those buyers who want to do business with them. This is a great way to gain referral business. Referral business up keeps your deal pipeline full at zero customer acquisition costs.<br><br>When you let serious players know you have access to money especially hedge fund money from such funds as a Dandrew, you gain their undivided attention because most people in the funding business do not readily get success to this type of money, this is shy you cannot put a price on the connection to Sal Buscemi and Dandrew that you have.<br><br>Learn to understand that, and if you think it&#39;s easy to gain access to hedge fund money, try calling other hedge funds. Call HBK in Dallas and see how far you get, it won&#39;t be very far. <br><br>So learn the value of what you have and get serious about this business, you don&#39;t get very many opportunities of this stature in your career.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Something quick here before a meeting. I read the ebook about the Art of The Raise that preceded the release of your book, which I just saw the link in my email from Lee Arnold.<br><br>If the book is anything like the small 29 or so page ebook, this book is going to really open the eyes of so many people, in the business. You have hit a home run as always.<br><br>I for one appreciate everything your doing for us. By next year, I will have every program you have available. Anyway if your wondering where I got the ebook, I got it from a link in your Facebook page, so yes, I cheated.<br><br>One more quick question. I have decided to form a LLC in Nevada and obtain a virtual office in Las Vegas. Is there an advantage to forming a family LLC, so I can make this a family business, provide for the kids and form a trust for them, so out of every deal, they benefit, or would a professional LLC be better.<br><br>OMG one more thing as I am hyped up today on a potential deal for us. You mentioned on the call with Lee Arnold about following in his footsteps with a test of some kind. Have you thought about taking all your programs, putting them all together, charging a fee of say $5,000.00, financing it over 6 months or extending it to one year if they are willing to agree to a 50/50 split of all fees and yield spreads for the year. Also they must pass a certification test to be eligible to do deals with you.        </p>

          No family LLC needed right now. That&#39;s later. <br><br>For the programs, we&#39;re going to be offering financing for these programs when the website is up. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

I spoke to a Principal of a firm that will be creating a new US REIT and they are seeking an Equity Partner for $100M.

          I don&#39;t know why you are so perturbed on my last comment.  I would never mention that I worked directly for Dandrew Media ,  which would be a gross misrepresentation.  I would only mention that I am working with <br>a major capital provider in offering funding for distressed, under and non-performing multi-family properties,<br>for the purpose of stabalizing these assets into a fully performing asset.          </p>

          I realize that properties must be in tier 1 or 2 cities.  Do the small banks and hard money lenders I get REO&#39;s etc from also need to be in Tier 1 or 2 cities?  Is a small city within the greater Orlando/Seattle, or whatever, area acceptable as a tier 1 city?          </p>

          Jeraldine, if I may comment. Tier 1 cities are great to work in and Sal is correct about Tier 2 Cities. In the program it is mentioned about MSA of 500,000 people in an area.<br><br>If you go down to City Hall in most cities in this country and speak to the planning dept, most have a report available that discusses which banks are coming to town and when. Banks spent ridiculous amounts of money on demographic studies to see if an area is going to explode with new commercial and residential construction.<br><br>They are like big box retailers, they are not going to spend money to establish business operations if the business is not there. Smaller banks will often liquidate notes, performing or not to create capital to invest, so you may find plenty of banks in this position.<br><br>If you look at most new development, there I&#39;d always a nice fancy sign out that says this project financed by such and such bank. They said financed, they never said mortgaged. Banks could be going into that project as a joint venture participant.<br><br>In addition, these signs often list the developer. Some of these developers may actually need money for a project such as student housing or may have build a residential development, carried notes to make a deal happen and are now looking to cash out.<br><br>I&#39;ve known many developers who developed a residential development on purpose, became the bank and carried paper with the goal of liquidating that paper and getting very cheap money to build a commercial development that gives them a return on investment that cannot be measured.<br><br>The cheapest money is always going to be money not borrowed.        </p>

          Hello Sal,  I was on the conference call with you and AJ last week and we discussed DIP Financing.  I received the course and went over it thoroughly.  In the last video you mentioned a &quot;continuing-ed&quot; for how to market for DIP deals.  Could you refer me to this training or give me some ideas on what the best direction to take would be.  I have my eyes on a transaction / property.          </p>

          Sal,<br>I was on the Lee Arnold presentation this evening and I wanted to say thank you for inviting me and no I did not do it for a copy of your new book, I did it because you invited me. This is one way to show respect for someone and this is a segway into a few comments for the new people.<br><br>My sister in law went to Wharton and worked for several financial institutions in a 32 year financial career. She worked for B of A, UBS and a wealth management concern in Dallas before passing away at Christmas 2013.<br><br>*When I first came on board at Dandrew as a banking program IM, I let her see the program and she asked me if I paid $25,000.00 to $60,000.00 to Dandrew and when I told her the price she said wow.<br><br>I asked why that response and her answer is worth people seeing. She said that the education in the videos, the concepts in the infographics, the continued training is a MBA quality education wrapped in one package. She said people that work on the street are not privy to the strategies and profitunities you make available, unless they are either a fund manager or account manager.*<br><br>Now I did not take advantage of Lee&#39;s program this evening, only because right now I am heavily focused on my future with Dandrew and Private Equity, Banking and Arbs.<br><br>Here is the point of this long comment and people need to understand what comes next. A finance degree will take you 4 to 7 years to fully obtain at a cost of $40,000.00 plus and you will start at the bottom as part of a team somewhere, with constricted responsibility until you break out and make a name through bringing in the big white elephant clients, very much like Charlie Sheens character in the first Wall Street movie. You will have to produce in order to be given the opportunity to leverage yourself into opportunities.<br><br>How much does it cost to be involved with the various programs Sal offers, $397 to $1500.00 and what&#39;s the value immediately provided? PRICELESS!!!. What are your options in lieu of doing business with Sal?<br><br>You can sit and watch tv, drink your drinks, eat your snacks and watch life pass you by. You can go out and get a job where you trade time for dollars and when you get that W2 at the end of year say Only if I, or you can invest in yourself and a financially successful future by going through the program your in, pickup a phone, call a commercial real estate broker and say I have money to deploy that is for time sensitive opportunities, do you or your clients needs funds for a opportunistic deal?<br><br>I am not a sales man I&#39;m a deal engineer but it wasn&#39;t long ago that I was that guy sitting on the couch, the guy working my rear off 75 hours a week for the wages of a guy who someone told what he&#39;s worth to the company and it was by chance that I saw a sponsored ad on Facebook that bought me to Sals front door.<br><br>Sal I will be seeing you at the top very soon.        </p>

          Sal, <br>Quick two questions...1) Will Dandrew be creating anything in terms of presentations for the IPad as well as an app<br><br>2) I looked at your bookmarks list and have secured many if those books and publications listed, are there any specific IPad apps you use or can recommend        </p>

If someone is interested in venture capital where is the application?  I am not the best in at internet efficiency.  So please excuse my short comings  in this area.<br>        </p>

          Hello Sal, I have only been able to find applications concerning real estate.  I am looking for an application that inquires about a business and the business plan.  Also, what the process is to have investors interested in the deal.  I thought that you were interested in all aspects of investing and am glad to hear that you are.          </p>

          No worries! <br><br>We are not VC&#39;s, however the same capital raising techniques can be used to raise capital around companies.

          Sal-<br>As always I find myself thinking my best at 0300 am for some reason. I wanted to pass this piece of wisdom onto those that are new here and equally new to this great business we are in.<br><br>If you can get the basics of how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together, you will learn to see opportunity around every corner, it is like a sixth sense, after awhile.<br><br>In the Private Banker program which is the level 1 program, you have many profit centers available to you. If you learn not to over think things, which then leads you to paralysis of analysis, and you don&#39;t prejudge any opportunity, you will learn very fast that you will be able to say, how can I help this sponsor-operator or how can I make money with this deal, and begin to use the power of what Sal and Dandrew is making available to you for your success.        </p>

          Very general follow up to hopefully help &quot;Eric&quot; (and others) from today&#39;s call re: the PLN. There was some back and forth between AJ and Eric without a concrete resolution, and I think the problem Eric was trying to solve simply wasn&#39;t clear to all parties. I&#39;m going to attempt to ask the question that Eric asked here in a little different way. <br><br>A PLN page comes as part of every intermediary credibility kit. There are also three unique forms that come as part of our Web sites: 1. a Request a Commercial Loan form  2. an Investor Questionnaire form and 3. a general Contact Us form. <br><br>Use and purpose of Contact Us and Request a Commercial Loan should be pretty clear to everyone. The first is a general catch all &amp; keeps our individual emails from getting SPAMMED. The second helps potential clients requesting a commercial loan (in the Private Banker vertical) to get specific about what they are asking for and collect the data we need. <br><br>The third, the Investor Questionnaire form, seems to target &quot;Individual Investors&quot; as described on the PLN page:<br><br>From the PLN page: &quot;Private Lender&#39;s Network™ (PLN) consists of Individual Investors, IRA&#39;s, Trusts, Pension Plans, LLC&#39;s, Corporations, etc.&quot; <br><br>The PLN page talks about return to lenders (debt), when interest is paid, terms of the loans (periods of no liquidity), tax treatment, etc. It makes the PLN concept attractive to someone (Mom and Pops) who might have some money on the sidelines to invest. One may conclude that the &quot;Investor Questionnaire&quot; is out there to invite individual investors - people who want to offer up their capital or self directed IRA funds to the PLN - to request more information as to how they might put up some of their money to be used to capitalize loans made by an intermediary entity. <br><br>Take a look at my page as an example: http://MLCcapitalpartners.com. Anyone familiar with the old rules around Reg D syndications might consider the &quot;Investor Questionnaire&quot; similar to the form we use to establish pre-existing relationships. <br><br>I think Eric was trying to clarify the relationship between the PLN program and the Investor Questionnaire - and to determine the intended use for the Investor Questionnaire form. <br><br>Eric - please correct any misunderstanding I may have about your question.         </p>

          No. We are buyers. But you need to be an Arbitrager to bring deals to us, otherwise the Deal Desk will ignore your deal. <br><br>And its nothing personal. when you submit a deal, your profile comes up and they are trained not to look at certain deals from folks who don&#39;t have certain privileges. <br><br>If you want to upgrade, go to www.AJsATeam.com <br><br>If you have these relationships, its probably a better fit for you and you don&#39;t have to worry about a monthly fee for a whole year if you upgrade to Arbitrager, or ever if you upgrade to Private Equiteer. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I have worked with small bank managers and purchased REO&#39;s from them, but in your program I am not buying them myself.  If a bank manager admits he has notes etc he would like to get off his books, what do I offer to do for him?  I&#39;ve watched hours of videos but not found the answer to this.  I&#39;m sure it is obvious, but I am missing it.        </p>

          You&#39;re going to say that your capital partner would like to look at them. Here&#39;s a script to use, Jeraldine. Copy and paste what I have in bold: <br><br>*Thank you for showing these assets to us. The total size is a little more than we can chew at this point, however, our capital provider would probably be interested in taking these down. Do you mind if I give my fund manager a look? I’d be happy to sign a Confidentiality Agreement with you.* <br><br>        </p>

          No ground up construction for hotels. <br><br>When you say Texas, you need to specific city. To me, there is only Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. Everything else isn&#39;t really desirable outside of those MSAs...        </p>

          I believe these properties are going to look to be refinanced because if there construction loan coming due.<br><br>With that being the scenario  what  are your initial thoughts on properties with the info given? Also being within the MSA guidelines.        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I just had lunch with a property manager.  She told me that her operator purchased a shopping center back in 2007 and he is trying to refinance his note with Wells Fargo; no luck so far.  He is &quot;under water&quot; on this property. (he paid too much for it back in 2007) but it is fully leased and is cash flowing now.  Is this something that Dandrew would be interested in looking at?  Thanks. -Rick        </p>

          <br>I’ve received the email on Friday Jan 28 regarding the 5-week coaching program, and I’ve tried to get a seat since then, but no luck; the seats have been taken! Is there any chance for me to get into the porgram now? I have the entire business set-up, hired an assistant full time, and my team is ready to roll the ball full speed…but I cannot reach anybody in Dandrew’s team, although I made several calls and left voice messages for Matt. <br><br>Any hope? <br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I apologize. Matt has been extremely busy talking to folks about this. I&#39;m not sure he isn&#39;t calling you because we&#39;ve hit the 5 or because he&#39;s just getting inundated with calls. I didn&#39;t expect this to be as popular as it has become. We didn&#39;t really market it that hard, by design. It was just to get a few more AJs trained. <br><br>I will send him a note to call you either way tonight/tomorrow. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal:<br><br>When my landlord on this house quit paying his mortgage, we were foreclosed upon.<br>After he vanished, I started showing up at the court hearings.  I asked the bank trustee&#39;s lawyer why they bid up the price at the Sheriff&#39;s auction, and he told me the bank was insured against this problem, and were protecting their insurance claim.  I was astounded.  <br><br>I had never heard of any insurance against said bank having to foreclose on these loans.<br><br>The hulk of the house is actually maybe worth $13K, the county Tax Assessor says it is worth $20K, and the bank bid it up to $48,300, which is the loan payoff amount.<br><br>What is this &quot;Insurance?&quot;  How does it work?  Do the insurance companies get title, once they settle these claims?<br><br>Do the insurance companies then sell tape?<br><br>Where do I plug in?        </p>

          Its more complicated than that and the person telling you this doesn&#39;t *completely* understand the process. <br><br>It has to do with the RMBS tranches being securitized and later insured. Not the houses. <br><br>This was supposed to happen and didn&#39;t because a lot of poor, sub-prime borrowers were rated in higher credit tranches (bait and switch) and the insurance companies sued the bank (like Ambac) for fraud and it started a whole issue. <br><br>I know that&#39;s a complicated explanation, however, this question has nothing to do with you getting deals sent to us. Let&#39;s stay on course here, Rocky. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Today I heard from someone who has a lead on 900 multifamily units for sale in Atlanta. When I asked for more information, the guy tells me that the seller will not sell for anything less than $22.5 Mil, and that the seller will not release cash flow statements without proof of funds and a letter of intent for the $22.5 Mil. Here is how I responded:<br><br>&quot;How can I determine the true value of these units without having the trailing 12 months of actuals? The sellers&#39; request is not only unreasonable, but also asinine. We will pass on this one.&quot;<br><br>This is not the first time I have encountered this type of &quot;posturing.&quot; It&#39;s so stupid.<br><br>Suzette        </p>

          I have encountered the same nonsense as ms. West in regards to owners/broker wanting POF and LOI before they give any info out! This is like making an offer on a car without knowing how many miles on it or size of engine, etc. Silly indeed!!!!!! This is gong to be fun......... Thanks for posting this.        </p>

          @rbnetworker, I enjoy running into people like this, because it gives me an opportunity to talk straight them. <br><br>Too many sellers wait for the Greater Fool to come along and buy their properties at--or above--the asking price. The asking price is typically inflated by an over-enthusiastic market environment. This is especially true in multifamily right now, because it&#39;s in demand. When demand increases, so does the willingness to pay a higher price; it&#39;s the laws of supply and demand at play.<br><br>The only problem with this is that real estate is a lot of work to operate, oversee, and maintain. It&#39;s success depends on 4 major things (1) it&#39;s basis, (2) it&#39;s financing, (3) it&#39;s management, and (4) it&#39;s cost at disposition. Because of these facts, the risk profile of real estate--as an asset class--is higher; a higher risk profile demands a higher return as compensation. In multifamily, an internal rate of return that falls below 14 or 15% before taxes is unreasonable unless you are reducing it to accommodate an equity partners&#39; required rate of return. Brokers will give you proformas without taking into account the true cost of ownership including acquisition and disposition costs. It is a half-ass approach, and half-baked idea, and yet brokers--along with some sellers--expect offers to co-relate to their proformas. <br><br>I make it a point to explain why my offers are not where they want it to be. Typically, when I do this, they can see the logic. The reactions I get vary depending on the character and personality of the person; for example, one broker&#39;s voice suddenly went up an octave and he then started talking really fast to get off the phone with me. After this, he would never return my calls or emails. In another instance, a broker blatantly lied to me arguing that she had already received an LOI from an interested buyer at the minimum price the seller was supposedly willing to accept. When my company withdrew interest, the truth came out that there was--in fact--no buyer and no LOI.<br><br>Games people play.<br><br>Suzette<br><br>        </p>

          Sal, I just spoke to a developer in Houston,TX.  He owns a multifamily acquisition and redevelopment firm that concentrates on class B &amp; C multifamily re-positioning projects throughout the greater Houston &amp; Dallas areas. Their focus is to acquire and redevelop distressed multifamily assets at 60% or less of the re-positioned value thereby realizing a significant yield upon refinancing and ultimate sale.  is this something Dandrew or Oasis would be interested participating as a 1st lien and/or equity partner?        </p>

          Rick: <br><br>This is definitely something we would be interested in. However, you need to find out what their deal sourcing is like and can they source. What they could get would be a JV Equity Facility. <br><br>Here’s what you do: <br>1.  *Confirm their deal sourcing.*<br>Where is it coming from? What is their process from “First Call-to-Funding”? <br><br>2.  *Send over their Bios.*<br><br>3.  *Send over their deal sheet.*<br>This talks about the deals they have closed and like a case study. <br><br>Then you know if you have something real or not. <br><br>*Sal’s Rule: Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions, it will both build and preserve your credibility.* <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Greg. <br><br>Any friend of Rich &quot;Motor City Big Mouth&quot; Dusek is a friend of mine. If you are a Banker, there aren&#39;t any there. Only the Private Equiteers get those traning modules and tools. <br><br>Right now, we have a special upgrade available with very limited availability for the Self Directed IRA Deal Structuring Workshop. <br><br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniete <br><br>I strongly encourage you to upgrade as Banker is below your pay grade if you already have a PPM...<br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Greg<br><br>First I would become a Private Equiteer to learn the business. Your link is here. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll still be able to get a seat from our Self Directed IRA Deal Structuring Workshop in May. <br><br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniete <br><br>And that is not part of the Banker program, obviously. That requires a lot more of a commitment than a $1... / $97 per month... <br><br>Then if you&#39;re serious you can come in like a few students do to spend a day with Sal. This is not cheap. If you are interested, call Matt 866-325-2336. <br><br>Thanks Sal        </p>

          SAl,<br><br>I&#39;m upgrading to Private Equiteer at the end of manuel 5 as a banker. The bridge loan (hard money) business is interesting and would be a good fit in our business. Over the past 2 years I have put my fund  (Equivest Capital) on hold because of creditebilty in private banking. Now since you have the kit I&#39;m restarting the  fund  I&#39;m  interested  in starting my fund.<br><br> my commercial real estate business is signing deals  and. we need short term capital for the purchase and flip. The properties are then broker as turnkey investment  to other investors.  <br>Not sure if you know Tim Hogan with Commonwealth capital,(www.commonwealthcapital.com) if not ,he is also I former wall street investment banker and has a completed program in raising capital. Since I purchased there fund producer for real estate and I,m able to producer completed financials for the funds. If you have time visit the site and click on the real estate/reit button and you can see where I&#39;m at in understanding your business , Reg D, filling out operation agreement, PPM...etc. As a mention in my last email to you what I&#39;m looking for from your company is the crediibility kit web site, education and business plan for my company&#39;s PPM.<br><br><br><br>Greg        </p>

          Greg: <br><br>Wonderful and way to step up you game. Here&#39;s what you need to do: <br><br>a) *Credibility Kit*<br>Go to www.PrivateBankerIdentityKit.com. <br><br>b) Register before the end of this weekend for Private Equiteer and you can still get a seat to the Self Directed IRA Real Estate Deal Structuring Conference. <br>We have 4 seats left. We&#39;re sending an email out tomorrow for the upgrade. <br><br>Then we have to reserve the rest for Day with Sal folks and other Virtual Coaching Candidates. <br><br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniete  <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          I received the following question through my LinkedIn Advertising, and I don&#39;t know the answer.<br><br>Scott: I have two questions: As a not-for-profit, we need non-recourse financing since our officer&#39;s can&#39;t guarantee loans because it goes against the IRS rules, do you offer that? Do you do bulk transactions that can be refinanced out individually over the coming year or so? For example: 2,000 units, 12 properties? Thanks,<br><br>Can I get some guidance?<br>Thanks!        </p>
