          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on the capital raise for the medical project I spoke about recently. We did the presentation to a room of 35 tonight.<br><br>I did the capital raise presentation and the other team embers handled legal, project plans, etc. After the event wad open to Q and A, we seemed to get far more questions from this one group of 5 doctors.<br><br>At the end of the evening, here is what the pitched us on.<br><br>1. They will provide $5,000,000.00 immediately for a 20% ownership. They will provide management services for an additional 10% stake. These are 4 plastic surgeons who invest together. They will receive proportionate income based off the 20% and cash out the 10% stake in year three. They will retain 20% ownership for the remainder of the project.<br><br>2. When they cash out their 10% stake in year three, they will then have the option of continuing management at a monthly fee of $7500.00 or stop at that point.<br><br>3. They will provide expansion capital for the second and third center and will commit another $10M for this endeavor.<br><br>4. Additional details are that we will master lease center number 1 for $50,000.00, paid $25K each 6 months. We will master lease for three years then we will have an option to buy it for $600K, paying a total over three years of $750,000.00.<br><br>5. I get a check within 48 hours for $25,500.00 as a fee for services and 5% ownership in center 1. Not bad for three weeks of work and some additional deal structuring and negotiations work.<br><br>So we raised $5M now with another 10M  within 18 months. The investor group liked my work and have some additional consulting opportunities they want to discuss Friday over Golf.        </p>

          From a list of medical center supporters and CPA&#39;s who do work with medical practitioners, the main invitation list was created, these investors who pulled the trigger on this were actually referred by a PGA Golfer who plays at our country club.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve decided in my commercial funding business to focus on three food groups, Multi family, medical office and warehouse. North Texas has a lot going on in the warehouse space.<br><br>My question us aside from the lending parameters already established by Dandrew, are there any additional caveats that need to be in the deal to make it worthwhile for Dandrew to fund outside of tenant type, lease duration and expiration, etc.        </p>

          Al, <br><br>These are not for us. This is for a local rehabber to buy. Perfect to be able for the seller to sell on wraps. <br><br>I would negotiate a deal with him that has seller financing in it - *on an individual asset basis* - then sell off each one by the shot to other rehabbers. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Pass. Too small.<br><br>And its Chigago, which means that the average size is 136,000 which is pretty low. <br><br>I would contact Bank of the Internet USA to see if they would want to find something like this. But Chicago is not looked that favorably upon right now.          </p>

          *If Dandrew is bidding on loans from a bank and another bank is also a bid on the same pool, isn’t the bank in a better position to win that bid because their basis level is different from say a firm such as Dandrew?*<br><br>Excellent question. Its not the *basis level*, its their *cost of capital*. It may be cheaper. Gordon will cover this at the workshop in depth, but if they have a cheaper cost of capital they can bid higher. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Just a quick question. On loan pools, is the minimum asset value $60K just as it is with Bulk REO?. A mortgage company has a pool of 215 loans they want an all-in on. The FMV is in the neighborhood of $33K.<br><br>Also have a pool from a different seller of 268 loans in Michigan, P and NPN that can be carved out. They told me it are land contracts and they are willing to let carve outs occur.<br><br>They said while most who allow cherry picking/ carve outs will expect a premium price for the right, they are in lieu of charging a premium, want the buyer to buy a minimum of 5.<br><br>Should I send the tape on the 268?        </p>

          James: <br><br>FMV meaning the *average* FMV? <br><br>We&#39;re a pass on this. We&#39;ll be discussing at the conference how to run a book selling these assets. <br><br>A mortgage company really lent on these assets? I&#39;m not shocked.

          Sal,<br>We ran into a problem today and had to get our attorney on this. The seller has an intern that released the tape when it was nit supposed to be released.<br><br>It has about 10% of assets in Detroit with the other 90% throughout Michigan. The tape was not to be released because the seller, an investment company was in process on doing workouts and other processes underway.<br><br>I got my attorney involved because I wanted to be sure we weren&#39;t in the middle of something we didn&#39;t need to be in. I knew we weren&#39;t but I wanted to be sure.<br><br>Anyway, as it turns out, the seller is an investment company that buys SFR&#39;s from banks, rehabs them if needed then resells them and holds the paper. They sell using the land contract process.<br><br>He has 6000 loans right now, throughout the country that he wants to sell and  is willing to discuss with me. He said his pricing expectations are between 43 and 50% of the UPB, depending upon the property, jurisdiction, how much they have into it, etc.<br><br>He said they could sit in these through the term but they really want to liquidate and reinvest because this is their business model. These guys are professional investors who understand the market, the business, financing, asset liquidation, modeling, etc.<br><br>He asked me about deals I&#39;ve been involved with not necessarily closed. He said he likes to know my story on deals I&#39;ve done, what I did with them, he said a lot of deals never see closing so he can&#39;t base a decision on my experience and capabilities by being concerned with only closed deals.<br><br>I told him about the rough deals I sent over to you, but never mentioned Dandrew or you. He said he was glad I mentioned them. He said they don&#39;t buy rough assets in war zones or at sub par pricing just to buy something. He said his firm buys turn keys but rehabs to bring the properties up to their standards and are mostly cosmetics anyway.<br><br>He said their name and their stamp is in every deal so each property must be at a certain level, as it enables them to sell at better prices.<br><br>I will keep you posted.        </p>

          JV/Mezz Loan: Mining/Exploration Canada: Graphite, Titanium, Gold, Silver and Other Minerals  <br><br>Sponsor has a 25-year ironclad lease on the 8,200 acre land located in Canada that has various types of mineralization that were shown in the previous years of exploration.  Over $7 mil has been spent to date to drill 146 holes that were tested all positive; the most important asset is the presence of Graphite (mineral that will revolutionize the chip technology), Titanium, Gold, Silver, Copper, and many others.   The land is valued today at more than $50 billion, and was divided in several zoning for mining: <br><br>M Zone: Significant Sedex type polymetallic precious metal massive sulphide deposit. Drilled indicated <br>and inferred resource of 1.2 million tons grading 9.85 oz. /t Silver, 6.06 % Zinc, 2.67% Lead, 0.06% Copper<br>and .026 oz. /t Gold down to the 1300 foot level.  Screen Analysis was done on 2 drill holes and the Silver<br>assays averaged 20 ounces/T and the Gold came out at 3 grams/t. Based on the type of deposit and the geology<br>data, experts believes the M Zone has 3 times the resource indicated.<br><br>Project would start with mining the M zone. Potential Gross Annual Revenue (USD) (Ag, Zn, Pb, Au, Cu) <br>= $ 134,806,600 <br><br>G Zone: Graphitic Argillite and Titanium: <br><br>Deep penetration electromagnetic survey (six drill holes) as well an Airborne EM survey picked the huge<br> Graphitic Argillite Horizon ranging in width from 46 to 149 feet.      <br>Samples of core were submitted to SGS Research, Lakefield and assayed up to 2% Graphitic Carbon.  <br>Important to note that this horizon contains 14 pounds/Ton of Titanium which can be easily recovered by floatation producing a high grade Titanium concentrate.     <br><br>C Zones: The C Lake area continues to return very encouraging gold and base metal assays associated with<br> Arsenopyrite in structural and volcanic terrains. Recent drilling has intersected Gold values up to 13 g/t over 0.5m, <br>8 g/t over 3 m, 2.4 g/t over 8.8 m and 4.3 g/t over 1.4 m. Sampling from trenches assayed 0.5 oz. /t Gold.<br><br>Current market value of the land = $50 billion<br>Skin in the game = land ($50 billon)+ $20 million<br>Loan Request = $200 million for mining <br><br>I know this is another “Big Elephant” project you are not interested in, but this may be big deal for an investor you may know, who has money and wants to secure his future and the future of his children/grandchildren. I am bringing these deals to you first, Sal before giving them away. <br>By the way, the NY city construction projects are going on pretty well so far; we’ll see!<br>        </p>

          Fulga <br><br>Give this one away. Its not for anyone I know. Actually, be careful because a lot of fraud happens with these deals. I wouldn&#39;t be pitching these deals really. Here&#39;s usually how they blow up and rip off unsuspecting investors. I&#39;ve seen this so many times in oil and this is the same way. <br><br>First,  you find a giant patch of dirt with no oil in it, have your engineers declare a trillion or two in recoverable reserves, issue stock against that valuation, sell enough stock to buy yourself a new Bentley, Rolls Royce and a Gulfstream V jet. Then you buy a few drill rigs for show, syphon a few hundred billion to the cayman&#39;s, reassess your trillion dollar fields and realize there&#39;s no oil, and poof... File Chapter 7. <br><br>Same with minerals. I know, I know, your deal is great. But they all follow the same script. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Where *exactly* are you with the NYC deal. Has it been papered yet? <br><br>         </p>

          Fulga,<br>I&#39;ve seen a lot of these deals lately. They all seem to talk about revenues yet when you ask certain questions, you always get the same answers which are, we just started drilling or mining, were in beginning stages, we&#39;ve spent a lot of money on dd and land studies, feasibility studies, etc.<br><br>Many of these are small companies and the question I always pose is, if this land and it&#39;s tracts are so heavy with the commodity being mined for, how come the larger players with larger capital resources don&#39;t know about it. The old saying of they aren&#39;t making any more land comes into play.<br><br>The other question posed always is how much additional money can fit into the capital stack and where do you want us comes into play as in any deal.<br><br>The usual answer is we need 100% funding. The answer to that is not going to happen. If they had the funds to do these expensive studies why do they not have any equity to put in?<br><br>Why do I see these deals? Because I&#39;m in Dallas and Fort Worth, home of many of these companies and they all want huge amounts of equity capital.<br><br>These deals are known as Dreams of fools because only unsophisticated people looking for the once in a life time Microsoft type score invest in these.<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been looking at your blog The Term Sheet on the website and I read what has been posted so far on residential markets being no mans land. I wanted to post something interesting here for those in the community that believe that there are still opportunities. Here goes, and it&#39;s on the web...<br><br>B. Wayne Hughes is a name that many may not know as of yet and I mean yet. Ever hear of Public Storage? This is the company that Mr. Hughes founded many years ago. Okay James what does Public Storage have to do with single family residential? great question.<br><br>B. Wayne Hughes and his new company American Homes 4 Rent is an entity that has come in to the Dallas market and is buying up all and I mean all of the SFR&#39;s that are available and is controlling the rental market. He is not looking to steal people&#39;s homes and gain rock bottom pricing. He&#39;s not asking the age old question most investors ask which is If I buy your home and pay you cash, what is the lowest price you will accept. Why is he not looking for lowest price points?<br><br>He has a war chest of a Billion Dollars in cash. He is concerned with building a rental income portfolio and is in it for the long haul. What can he rent a three bedroom 2 bath home for is more compelling to him than what can I buy this home for.<br><br>Bad news for Dallas investors and this is just the first stop on his nationwide home buying tour. He knows that once sellers know he is in the market for homes and he is not looking for lowest prices, they call and they will call.<br><br>If your a home seller who is upside down and have zero equity or low equity and your choices are to call this guy who says I will buy your home at ask or near ask versus calling some investor who says I will pay you 50 cents on the dollar, who will the home seller call first?<br><br>Go on the new Dandrew Website and read the blogs on residential Sal is spot on when he says residential is no mans land.<br><br>If your trying to become a residential property investor, realize that once B. Wayne Hughes and guys like him arrive in your market, your power is going to erode and erode fast.<br><br>Want to play in the residential market, start a fund with deep pocketed investors and raise a war chest of cash, because that will be the only point of entry you will have, in residential.<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I got the new website to come up. I am shocked that today is Monday and no one has commented on the new website as of yet, so let me be the first.<br><br>This is the nicest website I have seen in our industry, hands down. I believe that this website as you said is a statement piece. <br><br>I am thrilled to be aligned with Dandrew and lif this is just the first of what is to come, than what lies ahead is what everyone should be excited about.<br><br>Well done, well, well done.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I think I&#39;m about to ask a question that may have never been asked before. Now while I don&#39;t have a deal firmed up, I have been asked about the potential of this deal that follows...<br><br>Very experienced sponsor operator, has done in excess of $40M in deals to date ranging from SFR to MF and some industrial as well. Here is what they want to do.<br><br>They want to buy LLC&#39;s that contain very strong cash flowing MF properties. They want to then sell off some of the properties and repay the debt stack within 12 to 18 months and the remaining properties would be portfolio&#39;d then sold at a later time to raise capital for additional investments in some higher risk ventures.<br><br>They have 35% equity in capital reserves that they would be willing to block into escrow. If their available equity is not enough, they can partner with another entity who would go onto the deal and the loan with them. They also have some additional assets they can pledge to cross collateralize. They mentioned a free and clear citation plane and I said that it must be real estate. I told them planes go down in value every hour they fly and the market for planes isn&#39;t exactly robust if my capital provider had to try and liquidate.<br><br>Any initial thoughts?<br><br>        </p>

          They said that they own several unencumbered assets such as this Citation 10 private jet that they own. The escrow thing came from them. They are willing to block the funds into an escrow account so that the money is held aside.        </p>

          James, <br><br>Nothing says that your sponsor has no conviction in his or her own business than putting funds into escrow. <br><br>Insitutions like us don&#39;t like that kind of arrangement, because those funds can be hard to get to, yes, even in escrow. <br><br>In general, why don&#39;t they take some, throw it in as their equity in the deal, and then they get paid *pari pasu* (read (&quot;Even Steven&quot;) on the take out or sale event? <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Hope all is well. I have been posting some on LinkedIn. Anyway- I say I am direct to hedge fund. Is this the right verbiage to use? Some of responses do not believe it as they say that hedge funds can find their own tapes. I then say MAYBE- BUT in this case they are too busy doing capital raises and other things so why not delegate this to guys like me and others???? That is that. I believe this is it... LinkedIn is not the best place to find deals but a great way to build some relationships to do deals outside of LinkedIN. Thanks!!!<br>        </p>

          Richard, I agree to an extent about Linked In. Not the best place to find a deal but great to network. I have 2009 connections, all deal makers, but it comes down to informing them of what we do.<br><br>If you look at the summaries on potential connections, they all mainly say the same or near same thing. You have to stand out in what you say in your summary section.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Got my first tape over- performing- FL., GA., MO,TX,IND,some other states. 9.56 mill UPB. They have a lot of good info on it. Do not have credit on borrowers and finding out if the loans are recourse or not.<br>1 kicker- all 30 year terms with 3 year arm- Int rates go up to 10%. Seasoned average of approx 7-10 months.  So am gaging sellers expectations to see if we can move forward. Do you need credit on payors before the tape is sent? These are performing mind you. Thanks!!!        </p>

See on the DandrewMedia.com website “Carrots and Sticks”. <br><br>But recourse is a negotiated “carrot and stick”; meaning sometimes it’s there, sometimes it’s not. <br><br>There is a convention called “springing recourse”, where there might not be recourse layered on at some point if specific milestones aren’t accomplished in a timely matter or otherwise. <br><br>Remember, these are usually applied on *value-added* deals where there is a lot of heavy lifting that needs to be done. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br>They hid from me the fact that they wanted us to buy this, not lend on it. I&#39;m going to put my head into the oven now. They called me at 10 pm last night and said why do you need this information meaning the 5 data points and I said because we need this to determine If we want to provide debt on this and he said, wait, you are capital guys, I said yes, sometimes were debt and sometimes were equity.<br><br>He said oh I am the owner of the property, I&#39;m looking to off load this. I said, we don&#39;t buy things we lend on them through our capital provider, which is a large fund.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just saw this as one of your responses posted here on the Dandrew Dashboard. Can I put this on my website now?<br><br>We’re one of a few national finance companies that functions as a “one-stop shop.” Our firm specifically focuses on middle market financing (total asset value of $50 million and less) and has reclaimed the space left by many commercial real estate finance companies that did not survive the last downturn. <br><br> Our new bridge loan program will focus on transitional loans with the following parameters: <br><br> Size: $2 – 10mm <br><br> Term: 1 – 4 years <br><br> Rates: 5.5 – 6.5% (fixed or floating) <br><br>LTV: Up to 75% <br><br> The program is available to acquisitions, refinancing, and mini perms.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am in contact with a group that is in contract to buy a nice class &#39;A&#39; apartment complex in Charleston, SC. for $11.6mm. He has qualified for a FNMA loan, including the 10% liquid, and is trying to raise $3.2mm for the 20% down. What he would rather do is to get one lender for debt (long term, low interest rate) and an equity investor for the equity portion.

          During the most recent conference call. A large part of the discussion centered around the 3 income streams generated from a Commercial Real Estate Deal. My question is does the Intermediary ( me) have to pay for the Sponsor out of the money we collect in the three income streams??<br>&gt;I heard that a good sponsor can be found by me putting the word out at LinkedIn. If that is my responsibility, I think I have to contract and pay the sponsor??<br>&gt;<br>&gt;================================<br>Hello : Based on the last conference call, I have a question : Please see above. Thank you.        </p>

          Rocky, your making things too technical. I understand your getting back into the game. The strategies have not changed per se , just the markets. As far as paying people who you enlist onto your team in a deal, yes your going to have to pay them.<br><br>Your not paying the sponsor, it&#39;s these folks who are the beneficiary of the loan funds. The sponsor is the operator of the property.        </p>

          Sal, here is what I have right now and I&#39;m working on getting the deal together. A hotel in Dallas is expanding and has already acquired a vacant property directly across the street. They&#39;ve begun demo work already. Behind the newly acquired property sits a vacant parking structure, they said I believe is four stories.<br><br>They want to acquire the structure, and are looking at possibly taking an acquisition loan. My intern knows the owner of the hotel personally. He went to SMU with the owners son.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was approached by a CFO of an investment firm in Atlanta that buys SFR&#39;s from banks in portfolios and they resell the entire portfolios.

          Sal, the seller of the SFR&#39;s is trying to play a game of cat and mouse with me on this. They cannot come to the conclusion of their pricing expectations. I was very nice and very professional and simply said, without pricing expectations we simply are not going to be able to bid on your portfolio. I also reiterated that we would not be a bid on anything under 60K. They are without a doubt a mom and pop seller.<br><br>I wanted to update you on this. I have also received another portfolio in the neighborhood of about $4.7 million and I am waiting on their pricing expectations.<br><br>I am feeling as you may be on this that this is not going to be able to be bid on, I will see where they stand on Monday and advise.        </p>

          Sal,<br>My intern and I got together last week and we decided that in order to move forward and be more productive in our deal flow sourcing, we need to target our marketing to those sources outside of private sellers who are really mom and pops who have product but are unsophisticated.<br><br>We&#39;ve seen deals from these types of sellers that do to know their pricing expectations or are wanting par for product that is rough.<br><br>My intern began reaching out to a clientele that is more sophisticated and are actual investment firms such as the bulk buyers in Atlanta.

          Good strategy. Love it. <br>The mom and pops don’t understand the market really, the look at things very myopically, to say the lease. Somewhere they buy these assets and never realize what the market is paying for these. Then the market beats them up, realizes that your not a vulture and then comes back to you. <br><br>Time and circumstance will change all mom and pop buyer’s minds at some point. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Good day Sal. I am curious about something. Would Dandrew consider buying a bank that is in trouble? Would this even be feasible as it occurred to me that why not buy a bank with some non performing loans on there and this way you have them at a great price? Are there regulations that might prevent Dandrew from acquiring a bank??? Anyway- just a thought and if you would even consider this. Thanks!!!        </p>

          Richard<br><br>This is something Fred and I tried doing in 2010 via a bank recapitalization fund. The problem is that “problem” banks become “healthy” again through accounting legerdemain…. They are a moving target. <br><br>If you know one that is for sale, I’d love to take a look at it. But we need to get to the principals. <br><br>So, not to burst your bubble, but I spent a lot of time an expense on that and we got zilch! <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I&#39;ve been offline for a bit.  I&#39;m currently re-learning these lessons.  I&#39;m searching specifically for the lessons and link to FDIC that shows which regional banks hold less than two billion in assets.  Which module should I look in?        </p>

          Rocky, when you do it the way Sal says to with regard to the FDIC site, you have the choice of over $1B and 1B and under. I focus on banks under $1B which us what Sal says to do.        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br>I’ve received a proposal for a bridge loan $7.5mm for an apartment project in Jersey City across from Lower Manhattan.  It consists of rehabbing 2 existing vacant buildings for new apartments and upgrading available parking lot and garage.  The 16 apartments already in place are currently 100% occupied.  The bridge loan will pay off existing notes and construct 30 new apartments.  I know this is probably not in Dandrew’s wheelhouse.  However, would any of your cowboys possibly be interested with further info submitted?  Thanks.<br><br>        </p>

I know that area pretty well actually. But I’m sure you can find a home for this. <br><br>Remember, our min is $2mm for debt, $3mm for equity. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been seeing the name CrePig show up here a few times and wanted to provide some insight on it. Crepig is not a deal site or a site for anything meaningful.<br><br>The deals you will come across will always have send POF and LOI attached to it. You will ask for information to be sent and never receive it, ask me how I know, well I will tell you.<br><br>As a test, I replied to someone. I introduced myself, talked about what I do, my experience level and then started to talk various cocktail terms and zero reply and zero information. I informed the person that I needed specific information.<br><br>When I looked at the same posting again, I noticed that others received the deal. I noticed that they were nothing more than brokers who knew nothing. I realized that the poster knew he was not going to easily get a deal done through an experienced person.<br><br>Your going to spin your wheels and get nowhere fast.        </p>

          James: <br><br>Generally speaking, interns don’t really get paid. However, over the past few years some have been getting paid from larger firms. Now you’re not a larger firm. Legendary Intern Peter Kasyanenko put together a very robust and comprehensive system called Intern Intel Private Coaching Series. It is one of the crowd favorites. To learn more about that, go to here: <br>  <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathnifeu <br><br>The way you want to do this is give them pieces of the deal that close. They are learning the business  - and there are very few finance or business majors who *don’t* want to learn this business – in exchange for college credit and experience. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          James: <br><br>Catch-ups are more prevalent in the opportunity fund (value added) sector. This is a defined split of profits that go to the investor and fund sponsor. A high catch-up split would be 80/20 that is 80 percent to the fund sponsor and 20 percent to the investor until such time as the sponsor has received its 20 percent return on overall profits. Even though the catch-up mechanism<br>would normally kick in at the preferred return – for example, 9 percent – it would mean that for every dollar of profit over and above the 9 percent return, the fund sponsor would get 80 cents until the sponsor has received its 20 percent return on overall profit. <br><br>Now this has changed a bit since 2008, but as is everything with these types of opportunistic funds, everything is negotiable. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a question regarding recurring deals where your buying from same seller multiple times. Let&#39;s say in the case of the pool your looking at that I sent over and you buy it and I earn let&#39;s say a 2% fee. Let&#39;s say you buy another deal from same seller the following month, who determines the IM&#39;s fee on each subsequent deal?<br><br>Or is it a case where they come to me and say would your fund buy again, then that deal generates a fee that I decide upon?        </p>

          James<br><br>It’s net out of the bid. So the seller will probably not see what the Intermediary will make. That is usually between just the buyer and the Intermediary. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I know you don&#39;t buy things per se but fund them. I got a deal in tonight that is one for the books. I thought I would see what your thoughts are.<br><br>Class A Office Building, $29.15 Million firm in Silicon Valley. $2M rent roll annually. 8 tenants, nationally recognized brand name anchor tenant. Completely renovated in January of this year.<br><br>This is a value-add opportunity. Recent income bump due to rent increases. Now, what would make this a value-add opportunity? Can rent increases be considered a value-add?<br><br>        </p>

          James: <br><br>Rent increases are a catch 22. I wouldn’t go into this thinking you can increase rents arbitrarily, after all many a mult-family newbie thought they could raise rates. If the market resists, you’ll get killed. <br><br>In retail, these rents generally need to be disclosed prior usually though rent escalation clauses. The market isn’t too kind to rent increases today, so I would say this isn’t a meaningful value-added play. <br><br>And neither is reducing expenses, for that matter…<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just received a new deal from the same seller for the 5 note deal I believe your working on. Now this is a single note, NPN on a 40 unit MF in St. Louis, secured by a $912,000.00 first mortgage.<br><br>The question I have is this. Would a deal like this be attractive because the asset is a multi family as opposed to a SFR? I know this is a small deal and not really what would fit into Dandrew&#39;s criteria.        </p>

I setup emails for that domain as follows...<br>jb@jbcapital.ws, deals@jbcapital.ws, and info@jbcapital.ws., can you suggest any additional one&#39;s that I&#39;m not thinking about? I took your advice and got away from the gmail stuff.<br><br>Also, is it better to have a toll free number in addition to a local number? I am ramping up to really start acquiring and implementing the credibility tools, seeing that I have really begun seeing alot of deal flow.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to pass on something to the members that you have went out of the way to reinforce in getting my thinking to come full circle on the subject of risk.<br><br>Here goes. It&#39;s so easy to want a deal to be real, to put the cart before the horse, I do it, it&#39;s something that I&#39;m working on. Sal has told me just because something looks like a deal, doesn&#39;t make it so.<br><br>Pragmatically speaking, a deal really isn&#39;t a deal until the deal is scrutinized, has gone through due diligence and terms are created and agreed to and then you can say it&#39;s a deal. Until that time, it&#39;s an opportunity that needs to prove out.<br><br>You have to look at the risks. This is prudent business. It&#39;s so easy to look at the financial rewards first because you want to get paid. <br><br>Everyone wants the big score, the huge fees, etc. This is why the players like Blackstone for example focus on the larger deals. Why they undertake capital raises to create a two billion dollar fund. They are building a financial war chest so they can buy those $250 million dollar deals and up, or the myriad of ninety million dollar resort deals, etc.<br><br>It&#39;s easy to bypass risk because as an Intermediary, you have no risk in a transaction because your not writing the check. Your risk is the time your investing at the front end and the only thing you risk is losing a payday and maybe a equity piece on the back end. The funder risks losing their capital, their credibility, etc. People never remember the great deals you do, they remember the bad deals.<br><br>You have to ask yourself what can possibly go wrong if my capital provider gets into this deal and it goes south at any point in time during the term of the deal. On a funding deal, what can go wrong at 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, the day before the term ends. On a syndicated deal, what happens if the sponsor pulls the trigger on a bad decision, are the investors going to have to do a capital call and put more equity in, just to make the deal whole, etc.<br><br>For a fund such as Dandrew, it&#39;s more than just capital. It&#39;s reputations, credibility, future abilities to gain the trust of investors to place monies again, investors monies, pension funds monies. This is why Sal and Dandrew just do not buy every deal. It&#39;s more than just deploying capital. Money has two voices and two tolerance levels, pleasure and pain.<br><br>When life in the deal is great, money is happy, it&#39;s growing, it&#39;s generating rates of return, it&#39;s generating cash on cash returns, etc. When life in a deal is not so great, money voices it&#39;s displeasure with those who had their hands on it. It&#39;s like a woman who is scorned and it gets even in ways that no one wants to be privy to.<br><br>Sal tells us all, just locate the deal, qualify it through the five data points, put together the package, and send it to him. The only one who can speak for Dandrew is Sal and AJ. Let them model the opportunity and make the determination if the risk is worth them buying the deal.<br><br>Funds like Dandrew have complex software programs that enables them to see all the risks, often risk categories we have never heard of.<br><br>Always treat Dandrew&#39;s money as if it were yours. Be Sals Pal and look at risk first, reward second because at the end of the day, if the risks can not be properly evaluated and risk strategies arrived at and implemented, then there will be no rewards for anyone.<br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I just keep getting these massive deals on what seems like a daily basis. I have been presented with a huge deal. It is for $856M in loans. <br><br>I am questioning the deal because they&#39;ve presented a offering of Memorandum. This seems like more of a capital raise or syndication deal.<br><br>I remember that recently you replied to someone here and said sometimes these deals, even at the massive dollar volumes are actually very real.<br><br>On a deal like this, if it was analyzed and determined to be a real deal, how would a deal like this be structured? would Dandrew syndicate this deal or would it be structured where a larger fund partners with Dandrew?        </p>

          James. <br><br>In this case, the burden of proof is on you to prove to me why you think this $1 billion deal is legit. <br><br>We&#39;re smaller balance players; the reason is becuase that is where we are the biggest fish in the pool. Why does this person need you and not Goldman Sachs to move this trade? <br><br>So before you ask us questions on a hypothetical basis, why you feel as though this is legitimate enough to talk about? Did you peel back any layers of the onion yet? <br><br>Why Due Diligence did you do before merely placing a question here? I don&#39;t see anything of substance here. No meat to chew on. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I actually have looked at the Offering Memorandum. I was asking really as a chance to get some insight from you as to how a O.O.M. correlates into this being an offer from a seller of product to sell already existing inventory in their house as opposed to someone looking to either establish a fund to acquire these large pools or syndicate some capital to buy assets.<br><br>I have not looked at many O.M.&#39;s only because I have not been presented with one. My thinking is that I can make performance and incentive fees for each investor I bring to this deal, sort of as if I bought an accredited investor to a Dandrew Fund.<br><br>I really need to look at this and its merit.        </p>

          Sal,<br>The question you posed about why do they need me is a very compelling question, one that I lost site of. The answer is that they don&#39;t need me. I am going to put this to bed and focus on the other deals I have at hand.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Actually here is what prompted me to suggest this. Two weeks ago there was that exchange between Fulga and yourself and I chimed in with my four and a half cents and I caught a bit of flack.<br><br>Molly replied and said that members just wanted to get a better understanding of what causes deals to lose traction in the initial preliminary analysis once a deal is deemed to be worth taking a look at.<br><br>I am paraphrasing her comments because truthfully I don&#39;t remember them. I too recently have had some deals lose traction, well truthfully they never gained any, so I was thinking, wouldn&#39;t it be a good educational tool for those submitting deals to understand what causes a deal to lose traction, what are the factors that come out in the wash so to speak, that would make you say, you know, this is not going to be a pass.<br><br>I think that most have never been in the war room so to speak where analysts are actually looking at a deal, discussing it and figuring out how to underwrite the deal.<br><br>I enjoy everything you do, and I will be the first to tell anyone that working with you is for me, the best choice I ever made.        </p>

          Sal,<br>This is not really deal related but more for educational purposes. Just as your wife has you watching that hotel turnaround show, my kids have me watching Shark Tank.<br><br>The one shark who stands out is Kevin O&#39;Leary, the Venture Capitalist. I&#39;ve known many VC&#39;s from my days in the street and they don&#39;t invest in small ventures.<br><br>Why would a guy who is a fund manager such as O&#39;Leary invest in mom and pop businesses? what is the attraction of trying to scale a business that generates $50,000.00 a year into a multi million dollar entity?<br><br>Also, if I walk into the Shark Tank and I ask for $200,000.00 for a 10% equity interest in my business! I&#39;m obviously valuing my business at $2,000,000.00 and that value is not where my business is at valuation wise, how can accepting an offer of $200,000.00 and giving up 40% equity take my business from not being worth $2,000,000.00 to all of a sudden being worth substantially more?        </p>

          Sall,<br>I was approached by a bank and right now I don&#39;t want to put the cart before the horse and say who they are, they said they want to sell their entire portfolio, everything, and he confided that they are already in trouble, very deep and they no longer want to make mortgage loans, they want to convert to a small business bank and divest themselves out if what they have.<br><br>I asked the size of the pool and he said over $200M. He said they would be willing to sell in tranches over a negotiated time frame until everything is liquidated.<br><br>I&#39;ve handled it this way. I said the fund I&#39;m backed by is very real, so much more real than most you&#39;ll come into contact with that they use very specific tools that enable them to see into a banks standing (I was referring to the FDIC tool), that they are principal bids, that they are liquid, and that before I even move to determine their interest, I need a Bio on all the principals, a overview of exactly what their portfolio consists of in terms of loans, types, volumes, % of P, RP, NP, etc.<br><br>I told him that were only going to bid on real estate secured loans, not loans secured by retail businesses, equipment leases, etc. Were not going to be a player in any other space but real estate secured loans and Bulk REO.<br><br>I then suggested that he assemble a portfolio of his scratch and dent loans seperate, because we could possibly be interested in saving them the headache and unnecessary hassles of filing the legals and at best case scenario end up with even more negatives on the file which will lower their credit standing with the fed and make the cost of money more expensive for them.<br><br>I will keep you in the loop.        </p>

          Agreed. Get the tape. You&#39;re doing something right if you&#39;re producing all of this deal flow. <br><br>Why would you need their bios on the bank principals? <br><br>I would bet that this bank has never put a tape together before and they will need a little help. <br><br>Ask me how I know this...<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br> I am simply just doing what you have taught us to do. I air on the side of caution.  You have taught me that it is important to dot your I&#39;s and cross your T&#39;s.<br><br>You have taught us all that it is extremely important to be direct, to know your deal, know the players and the inner workings of the deal and not the country music love song.<br><br>I am ready to do this, if it is real. I am simply going to provide them with a list of the information we need to see on a excel spreadsheet, and have them assemble the information.<br><br>I am not going to take on the liability of putting together the tape. I always heed your warnings. <br><br>        </p>

          I wouldn&#39;t ask for bios. Call those dogs off. Just get the assets. <br><br>Anyone who works at a bank has probably gone through extensive background checks if they are at the level you&#39;re playing at .        </p>

          Sal,<br>We had our month end meeting today, which is usually at my home with myself, my attorney, my wife/partner and now my intern.<br><br>We have been analyzing our deal flow and we came to the conclusion that with being in Dallas and with as much business as there is right here in Texas that perhaps we need to keep our deal flow in state.<br><br>In your experience, is it pragmatically speaking, better to stay in areas you know in terms of being able to control the deal, knowing your market versus say a Philadelphia?        </p>

          James: <br><br>First, good for you for having month end meetings. That is important. <br><br>Second, the answer to your markets question is not a straight forward one. <br><br>On one hand you’re fortunate to live in one of the best pro-business, pro-landlord, pro-investment, fastest growing city in the United States. Everybody loves *urbanized* Texas and Dallas is the crown jewel in the Lone Star State. <br><br>So if you’re looking to syndicate money to buy assets, Dallas is a great place to start. You can attract money by doing that. <br> <br>If you’re crossing trades (Arb’ing) or financing deals (Banking), then no. You should look outside your home state. That is because you’re relying on us to do the due diligence and not yourself as its not your job or responsibility to go hard on costs to do things that must do anyway. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br>This is what you asked me to post about the Philadelphia 170 deal. I really appreciate the time you spent on this deal, going the extra mile for me.<br><br>I have advised the seller that this will more than likely be a pass. He&#39;s asked me to exhaust all sources. I have another outlet but they are going to want me to acquire first then sell to them. Not sure why.<br><br>I was very direct in a non confrontational way and I said I know you have better product, your trying to sling crap my way to see what I can do. He finally said I have a portfolio in a Myrtle Beach, I&#39;m going to send and no one else has it. He was holding up to capitalize on the interest gain until June.<br><br>He said every asset is above $60K, all waterfront properties and he is the owner of these assets and can sign all docs. He said we can cherry pick what we want and the rest he will hold into for income. He said he is not pulling the good stuff for himself, and as I put it, slinging crap.<br><br>Anyway, the new deal came in, all the assets are above $200K in value, so I&#39;m going to take a look at it. A few side notes to clarify a few things.<br><br>This is the same seller that sent me the Canton 68 and the Philly 170, all rough assets. I was told at the beginning that he gets really good stuff all the time. I spent a fair amount of time in conversations with this seller and continually stated all assets must be at $60K in value, and I wanted to be firm with him.<br><br>I don&#39;t make it a practice to rough people up verbally and am not a proponent of it. I don&#39;t want my firm to gain a reputation of being a loopnet type deal clearing house.        </p>

          James: <br><br>In a non-confrontational way, tell these guys (and I hope all Members are reading this):<br><br>*We’re only a bid on asset $60K and higher of value, invested.*<br><br>If you tell them this up front, there are no hard feelings. <br><br>Many *newer* Intermediaries make the mistake of saying “yeah, we’ll buy anything, yeah just send me a tape” and quickly realize they are flinging poo at us. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve just printed your reply. I&#39;m going to use it. I had to adjust my ways between going from banker to PE. When I was at banker level, I said just send me the deal and I will take a look at it, not realizing what I was setting into motion.<br><br>I got a deal in and I never sent it or told you about it. It was to fund a closed down quarry that the sponsor wanted to convert to a recreational facility where people bungee jumped.<br><br>Zero experience, 3.5 % to put down! zero money to buy equipment! and this deal came in because I said just send it! it took me a lot to not laugh when I said it was a pass.<br><br>I listen to everything you say and I am learning a lot everyday.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to put this out there for the community to read. It&#39;s more for motivation. In the past 4 weeks or so, I&#39;ve submitted I think just about $26,000,000.00 in deals and I&#39;ve yet to submit a Mobile home park acquisition deal at $13,750,000.00, the deal package for 12 multi families in Dallas at $9,950,000.00 and the package on the $29,000,000.00 class A office building.<br><br>Why am I mentioning this? Not to brag, but rather to show that if you just do what Sal and Dandrew tell you to do, if you ask questions, if you don&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel and you network with those that share an alignment of interests, you can be successful.<br><br>Now will Sal buy every deal or fund every deal? No, but if you refuse to fall out when Sal says it&#39;s a pass and you keep plugging along, you will get a deal done.<br><br>Think of it this way. If Sal buys a deal and you make $100K or even $30K as a fee, not many people get that kind if money in their hands at any given time in life. If you spent 5 hours on that deal for that fee, how much money did you make per hour?<br><br>Now do one more deal a year, even part time and you will have uncovered the power of this business and why so many gravitate to the world of high finance.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I will admit to everyone here that I&#39;m guilty of sending some rough deals over to you, and I was thinking about how this could be a lesson in itself and help those still searching for their first deal.<br><br>What factors come into play that lead to the determination that certain assets are considered rough.

          James<br><br>Very good question again. <br><br>*1. Performing Notes:*<br>*Yield* is what investors want. So this is why they bid down as compared to the face value of the note. The lower the bid, the higher the yield. *Basis* is not so much of an issue with *performing* notes. <br><br>*2. Non-Performing Notes:*<br>Basis. The lower the better. No yield so you’re buying this for control of the asset, not so much yield. And this is a function of costs and time to foreclose. <br><br>*3. REOs*<br>*Basis.* Some folks will tell you that they will pool and say it throws off a cap rate or NOI, but most *sophisticated (aka institutional) investors* will look at the basis only.  If you’re talking to *retail investors* they are less sophisticated and will look at the rental cash flow, which in my opinion isn’t an accurate way to look at this product. <br><br>Keep up the good work. <br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>An investor friend of mine who buys SFR&#39;s on a regional basis in the TX, OK and LA markets asked me over coffee this morning, if I use Google Earth in my practice and I told him no, I do not and his reply was, you could save yourself a lot of time and frustration.<br><br>My question is, do you believe this is a good tool to use to spot check properties on a tape to see what assets actually look like?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Why does he use it? <br><br>What does he think you would want to use it for? <br><br>We don’t use this (as the *Buyer*) as we use ClearCapital to do BPOs for us. We need to use objective 3rd parties for these, Google Earth isn’t regularly updated and if a trade goes wrong, we need to hold someone accountable. <br><br>Case in point, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, some homes had notes that were actually – performing. On Google Earth the structure was still standing. <br><br>*But when the BPOs came back, it was under water*. <br><br><br>The Seller (a bank) tried to tell us there was still as structure there. <br><br>As an Intermediary arbitraging these deals, *you should not be looking at Google Earth images as it’s a waste of time, and we’re going to get BPOs anyway.*<br><br>So the only reason he said this was probably because he thought you were a buyer or doesn’t understand how institutional buyers operate in this business. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Well, I told him about the Philly deal and I think he was suggesting its use as a means of looking at the assets first so I&#39;m more in tune with the deal and better prepared to know what the deal looks like, just as a barometer of sorts.<br><br>I don&#39;t use it and really don&#39;t like it.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Thank you for the time you spent on ten Philadelphia 170 Deal. I have advised the seller that this will most likely be a pass. He&#39;s asking me to exhaust all sources. I have another outlet but they are going to want me to acquire first then sell to them, not sure why.<br><br>I was very direct in a non confrontational way and said I know you have better product, your trying to sling crap my way to see what I can do. He finally said I have a portfolio in Myrtle Beach I&#39;m going to send and no one else has it. He was holding up to capitalize in on the interest gain until June.<br><br>He said every asset is above $60K, all waterfront properties and he is the owner if these assets and can sign all sale docs. He said we can cherry pick what we want and the rest he will just hold onto for income. He Saudi he is not pulling the good stuff fir himself, and as I put it, slinging crap.<br><br>I am not going to send this until I am sure we have something here. My goal is to make money and reinvest some back into getting the Bulk Financier Program, spend a day at Dandrew even if it costs $15K, to me it&#39;s a great investment in myself, and to get all the tools you make available, the credibility kit, the trading desk service, etc.<br><br>This is what I am going to do forever, this is why I&#39;m constantly asking questions, constantly working day and night, reading all the trade papers and journals, studying various funds and how they structure deals. I&#39;m 1000% dedicated to this and failure is not an option.<br><br>I never shared the following with anyone but I will with you. My wife is very ill. She has had two heart attacks and a stroke. She has type 2 diebetes and diebetic neuropathy. Most of my life savings has gone to medical bills. I sold a home I owned in Denton, Tx valued at $550,000.00 and downsized so I could get ahead in bills and shed some debt and this is why I upgraded to the PE program, so I could take advantage if every opportunity to make money.<br><br>This us why I work so hard right now, so I can make my wife&#39;s life easier and I know this business takes a lot of work but I&#39;m willing to do what is needed. I&#39;m making some errors in deal judgement and I appreciate you hanging with me when it would be easier to just kick me to the curb.<br><br>Anyway, the new deal just came in, all the assets are above $200K in value, so I&#39;m going to take a look at it.        </p>

          Sal,<br>One of the most successful note investors in the business has elected to sell off some of his inventory. He hardly ever does this. He wants to acquire a larger pool and will be reinvesting new money into it.<br><br>He has essentially said, tell me what your looking for and I can almost guarantee that I have it. He is very astute, understands the business very well.<br><br>I have emailed him and informed him of what we are looking for. I am also thinking that he could be a great candidate for a credit facility program. <br><br>I will let you know who he is once I see a tape from him. This guy is the Josh Cantwell of the note business. This could be the turning point for my business. I already have a relationship with him because I had a small pool that would have never met Dandrew&#39;s criteria and he was set to get into the deal when the seller decided to go another route on the deal.<br><br>I will keep you in the loop.<br><br>James        </p>

          Ah. Great question. <br><br>*Retail Investors* (aka Ma’s-n-Pa’s) will pay par because they feel as though they are getting a good deal. These are usually the sales pitches from hard money lenders who will sell whole loans or partials to a group of doctors and dentists. The aforementioned doctors and dentists don’t know any better – about seasoning, etc. – and will gladly pay par because they see a face yield of 12-15%. <br><br>Institutional Investors (aka Smarter, More Sophisticated) have higher yield requirements and will pay less for the note to get a higher yield. <br><br>*The lower the price, the higher the yield.* <br><br>*Institutional Investors* also are more sophisticated to buy and bid from banks where the average Retail Investors can’t and won’t.         </p>

          Sal,<br>I may have asked this previously and forgive me I did but don&#39;t remember and am asking again. A gentlemen I have known a long time, has many banking connections. He is a former industrialist that my father in law and I play golf with.<br><br>He is in the as he puts it, the connection business. He called me today and said remember you mentioned your looking to connect directly with banks and I said yes, he said I have 35 bankers right now that I&#39;ve known for years, I can give you their name, phone number and vice-versa and you strike your own deal.<br><br>He said he gets paid by them. He has no say in any deals, doesn&#39;t hand deals off, engineers nothing. If a successful deal is done, they renumerate him.<br><br>Is this considered a broker deal?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I realize we have a lot of new People here who may be reading the posts, your replies and may be wondering if they are in over the heads. I wanted to share the things I&#39;ve learned in my time here.<br><br>First, if your new, welcome. Welcome to what is hands down the best opportunity in our industry and yes, were an industry that has been around for centuries. <br><br>This is a business where you will be a life long student, because there are so many avenues for making money and so many strategies within each of those opportunities. You will certainly get a lot of intellectual capital from your relationship with Dandrew.<br><br>The one thing I can say is that Sal is not the only educator/guru in the business, there are many, but none better. Sal tells you the truth and if he has to lean on you or slap you around, well not literally of course to make his point, he will. He wants everyone to do well, he has said that.<br><br>Sal and AJ work long hours to make tools available that are real world, not the pie in the sky crap others are rehashing and selling that didn&#39;t work ten years ago, five years ago and never will.<br><br>I have found that with Dandrew, you get back what you put in. This is an action business and one of relationships. Without relationships, your never going to get off the ground. Without action, you&#39;ll never get off the ground either.<br><br>I hear from many on a regular basis things such as, I setup a Linkedin page, I have 100 connections but no one is knocking down my door to send me deals or I setup a Twitter page and all I get is friend requests from Hooters Girls.<br><br>Pick those you do business with based upon whether they can actually bring you deals, whether they will have an alignment of interests. If your looking to do Bulk REO deals, your Linkedin page must have connections to those that are in that segment of our industry. If your a banker, your connections need to be with real estate brokers, hard money lenders, commercial property owners, etc. <br><br>Also come to learn exactly what Dandrew does, what their core businesses are, because if you have no intention of having anyone other than Dandrew as your capital provider, you will want to send only those deals that you can get funded. <br><br>Case in point, a lot of development deals seem to make their way here, Dandrew does not fund these. Why would you spin your wheels getting info on a deal that your capital provider will never do when you can spend the same level of time getting info on a deal that your capital provider does all the time.<br><br>I&#39;ve learned in my time here that Sal is not in the junk business. What I mean by this is that they have no interest in looking at and funding deals that are mediocre at best. Look at it this way, the same amount if time goes into a $2,000,000.00 deal, a $20,000,000.00 deal as does a $500,000.00 deal. A pristine stabilized deal as a less than good deal, so where do you think Dandrew&#39;s interest lies???<br><br>The biggest two things I&#39;ve learned is to think like an investor and look at risk first and to ask myself, if I were looking to park my own funds into a deal, would this deal be the one. If it&#39;s too much risk and not enough reward for someone with little to no money, what makes you think the risk and rewards levels will be any different for those with capital?<br><br>Your in the right place at the right time  to really do well in life, how well you do depends upon you.        </p>

          Sal,<br>After looking at Fulga&#39;s posting about the luxury homes in Colorado, I begun doing a search of pension funds who invested in the ultra high end home development opportunities in Colorado. Why I chose Pension Funds? It just came to mind.<br><br>I was quite surprised to find that the Dallas Police and Fire Fighters Pension Fund that has $9.4 Billion under management, invested $400 Million in a development in Colorado in 2008 and 6 years later, they have a zero ROI and they did this a second time in Arizona with near same results.<br><br>How can we make a play here on something like this? I think we could bring value in some capacity, just not sure how we could.        </p>

          James<br><br>there is a lot of fraud that goes into these &quot;sucker deals&quot;. <br><br>I don&#39;t know what the play is. These are assets where a developer is taken off the hook and pension funds are the bigger fool. Usually these are politically oriented and those who win aren&#39;t the pensioners...<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Well if I were the board of this pension fund I&#39;d be looking to hold the person who authorized the deployment of funds into these deals accountable. I don&#39;t know what the play would be either.<br><br>Thank you for your insight on this.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was approached two days ago to buy a portfolio of 12 multi family properties in Dallas, Texas that needs work and repositioning. It&#39;s a value add opportunity. All twelve properties for $9,500,000.00 being sold by a private seller and it&#39;s off market. It&#39;s has a double digit cap rate.<br><br>Currently it has a NOI of just north iif $440K and a pro forma of just north of $770K but I believe that if repositioned properly, the pro forma NOI could be raised to about $900K.<br><br>I&#39;m going to leverage my intellectual capital into a consulting gig. The real estate broker is doing this for 3% commission because I think they have had a long term relationship. I have not had to do any heavy lifting on this so I&#39;m thinking a flat rate fee of 2 points for bringing an experienced sponsor operator to the table and then orchestrating the funding for the sponsor operator through Dandrew.<br><br>How I want to structure the compensation and the deal is as follows.<br><br>Flat fee commission for locating buyer and creating funding strategy: 2 points<br><br>Funding fee commission: Charge 1 point<br><br>Equity position on the back end:  5 percent.<br><br>Take three of the buildings and create a condo conversion opportunity, creating a selling opportunity for the buyer of the twelve properties where they sell the units and use that money to retire the capital stack. The three properties would be the ones that will generate the least in rental income, even if they are renovated. This would be capitalizing in the highest and best use strategy.<br><br>Any thoughts?<br>        </p>

          Sal, something that comes to mind and this may be an aggressive strategy here, but what about doing a master lease on all 12 properties commingled with a seperate agreement as an option to buy in 12 months. The master lease would require me to manage the deal and pay the lease holder one payment per month. They make what they would anyway in terms of income without the hassles of managing and the expenses. I would hire a management company to do the hands on.<br><br>My thinking is that I can go in, reposition them and get them stabilized. I can prep the condo conversion and since the three are by Baylor Hospital, sell them off to Baylor Hospital who can come in and finish out the conversion to medical condos.<br><br>Use the funds from selling off to the hospital to pull the trigger on the option, complete the acquisition and refinance to pay down any remaining debts and pull some capital out to add to my retirement fund.<br><br>Any thoughts?        </p>

          Hello Sal &amp; AJ,<br>For the first time, someone has entered information on my banker’s website through the PLN page wanting to invest $10,000 for 1 year.  I’ve never had an inquiry through PLN before so I don’t know how to address this with the potential investor.  Please advise.  Thanks for all the help and education.  <br>        </p>

          Dave, <br><br>This is great. However, $10,000 isn’t enough to do *anything* with. But you should keep in in mind for when larger deals come down, you can patch together his $10,000 with others. <br><br>I just want you to make bigger money, that’s all! But I guess you have seen for yourself that the <br>www.PrivateBankerIdentityKit.com *works*.  <br><br>This is good news for you, your business and your overall confidence. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>To me it looks like the PLN portion is to combine capital from various retail investors to ultimately use for syndication for a particular commercial deal.  If this is correct, I’d ask what’s the best utilization of the site as far as marketing to find investors,  how to find choice properties to syndicate, &amp; how to respond to investors that say they want to invest a particular amount like the couple that filled out the form on my site - $10,000 for 1 year.   To me it’s the chicken or the egg – find a property &amp; then market the PLN, or market the PLN to find investors and then find a property.    Or, I may be way off base here.  <br><br>        </p>

          Dave<br><br>There are many ways you can generate revenue from this. And, because I am your mentor, I will tell you *the #1 mistake that all investors make is to find a deal first*, and then scramble to find investors. That is a 1st Class ticket to frustration, broken dreams and discouragement. <br><br>The reason why we can do even more deal types than we care to advertise is because I have relationship with investors that are “axed” for certain deal types and if they fit, the get closed. <br><br>So this is a resource that you should continue to keep in touch with, cultivate, build and then utilize these investors any one of these ways: <br><br>1.  Place them into someone else’s deal if you don’t have one. If you are a Hard Money Financier, we call this “brokering” and if you make 5 points on 100,000 that’s $5,000 (5 points on 10,000 is enough to buy a nice pair of shoes for your wife, but still, there is value here if you keep building the list). <br><br>2.  Sell the lead to Hard Money Lender(s). Yes, you can sell the lead more than 1x. As long as you disclose this. $50 for the name, $100 to take it off the market altogether so its exclusive (and make sure you hold to your word that you’re selling this exclusively otherwise, like they say, building trust is like a skyscraper, takes years to build, seconds to bring down). <br><br>3.  Place them into your own deals. If you are a Capital Syndicator, then you bank these names, send them your “What is a Syndication” Pitchbook, then when the deal comes, send them your “Deal Level” Pitchbook. <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br>I just got something that could be a deal and I will give you a brief overview. 12 Notes in California, all performing, all assets except one is above $60,000.00. The one that is below $60K is a busted Heloc, asset value dropped to $18K, payments being made to bankruptcy trustee outside of plan but is current.<br><br>Pricing expectation is 93% of UPB but I think we could get them down, I&#39;m not sending anything more on this to you until I get at the inner workings of the deal to see where they really are at.<br><br>Is this of interest to you?        </p>

          I will send the tape. I spent some time on this after dinner. Here is the figures.<br><br>Original Balances: $3,315,900.00<br>Current Balances:$ 2,179,212.00<br>Asset values (Through Appraisal) $7,326,000.00<br><br>I verified that this is direct from the seller, which is an investment corporation. They stated, we have all files and docs, can ready them for DD immediately.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting for the monthly payment amounts so we can get an idea if the cash flow figures. I will send the tape once I get these.  If you would like to bid on the sub $60K I&#39;m certain they would love to get rid of it. I don&#39;t really think they would mind selling 11 of 12 loans at one shot.        </p>

          2 questions, please.. I put it here because it didn&#39;t seem to fit the other categories...<br><br>1.  Regarding the Credibility Kit.. I already have a Marketing Services LLC; do I need &gt;to get another separate LLC for Camellia Capital Funding (the name I selected for this business), or can I make it a Camellia Capital Funding, a division of Ken Fong Marketing Services, LLC (or a dba).  I need to select the &quot;proper&quot; name for my business for the credibility kit; <br><br>2.  Can I use my UPS Store address as the business address, and not my home address?  I work out of my home.<br>        </p>

          Ken,<br><br>1.  No. Just keep it as Camellia Capital Funding. <br>Do *NOT* put on there “…a division of Ken Fong Marketing Services, LLC”. <br><br>2.  Yes, use the UPS Store Address. That is fine. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Just to be clear, you are saying I can use Camellia Capital Funding for the Credibility Kit, and not need to create a separate LLC for it?  Do I need to register the business name with the city (i.e.Doing Business As)? (and separate bank account?)  Just trying to figure out how do I do business under Camellia Capital Funding, and process checks from Dandrews. I guess you would/could send checks to me make out to me and not Camellia Capital Funding.. <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>Ken        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am aware that Dandrew buys loan pools and loans that are performing. You have also indicated twice in recent times that banks don&#39;t really have an incentive to liquidate these types of assets because the status if the loans are obviously current.<br>I have a bank in Fort Worth Texas they may want to liquidate some of these, what are the risks in buying these outside of the potential to no longer be performing. Also when you look at the risk, does the question ever come into play of, does the bank know something they are not sharing and when your scoring the pool do you give the pool a lower score to offset this potential key event?        </p>

          James: <br><br>First, this is not a *“key event”*. A key event is the event in commercial value-added deals that must happen for the deal to be a success. For example, a large NNN tenant signed on to a retail center. That is what the exit strategy is contingent upon. <br><br>Regarding the Texas maybe-soon-to-be-probably-will-be defaults, the largest function of pricing these are *costs required and time to foreclose*. <br><br>I think I answered this or something similar to these, but in Texas, and we love Texas, you can lasso their asses out in 21 days for non payment. If you have an attorney who is good. <br><br>So just keep that in mind. And now’s the time for this guys to move balance sheet because the longer it goes, the deeper the discount…<br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>There are many of the PE&#39;s here that may not know that funds operate on a 2 and 20. This is as you and I know, 2% of fees and 20% of returns generated, both going to the fund for compensation, but could you elaborate if this is the industry standard or are there sometimes variations in this compensation formula?        </p>

          James<br><br>This is a great question<br><br>In the “JV Equity vs. Fund Structures” module, I discuss that not all investors pay rack rate. <br><br>For example, some investors pay less and some pay more. And the best analogy I can make is like buying an airline ticket to Las Vegas. <br><br>Let’s assume that all folks will fly coach coming to my event in Las Vegas from the same city. <br><br>The person in front of you will pay more than you did. The person next to you may pay less. <br><br>If Warren Buffet invested in my fund, he would want “0% &amp; 0%”; meaning he wouldn’t pay any fees or splits. But I would get to tell the world that Warren Buffet was an investor in my fund, which would bring more people in who would pay 2/20. <br><br>Sal<br><br><br>        </p>

          Aspen CO: Land at Ski Lodge, base of ski resort (“ski in/ski out/ 14 luxury properties”)<br><br>Everything about this deal is LOCATION: 3.5 square miles land at the famous Aspen CO ski lodge. The last piece of land in this area has recently become available and it is located at the base of the ski resort.<br>Sponsor wants to acquire the land and build 14 luxury homes, about 6,000 SqFt each.  After years of heavy fight with the building department (very difficult to get permits in that area), permits have been obtained.  The land is appraised at $38 mil, and the gross revenue estimated at about $200 mil. <br><br>Sponsor needs a JV to buy the land, with 100% financing, and in turn he is willing to provide equity as per lender’s terms. Once the land is purchased, sponsor will have no issue to raise the capital for construction. Developer Bio /Proforma will be provided if there is interest in this type of JV (100% financing with equity as per lender’s terms).<br>Here are the figures:<br>• Land acquisition: $35,000,000<br>• Total projected building cost: $68,162,600.00<br>• Total projected development cost: $103,162,600.00<br>• Projected sales price: $2,500.00 per square feet or $13,800,000.00 per home<br>• Total sales revenue: : $193,200,000.00<br>• Net: $72,649,000.00<br>• ROI: 70% or $50,854,580.00<br><br>Is Dandrew interested in this type of JV?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Fulga, why don&#39;t you become the JV Partner yourself? Use your intellectual capital to leverage your skill sets to captain the deal. Your intellectual capital has a value just as goodwill has a value in a business sale. Anyone can get a JV Partner who sits around like a puppet and brings no real value, how many people get a JV Partner who actually can do what you do, I do, etc.<br><br>Provide your services as a consultant in the deal, handling the heavy lifting for an equity piece on the back end. Prep the financial package for a $5,000.00 fee paid upfront.<br><br>Think you can&#39;t do it? don&#39;t forget, you have Sal to answer your questions here.         </p>

          Fulga,<br>Call Cooley LLP in Broomfield, Colorado at 720 566-4000, tell them you have this deal that needs a JV Partner in a Ski Resort. They are a law firm that has clients that are extremely wealthy, some I believe are motion picture actors and actresses, pro athletes, Fortune 500 CEO&#39;s who invest as passive investors and Cooley provides the legal in the deal.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I do a lot of meetings on the fly. On any given Monday or Thursday I can be found sitting at the Crescent Court Hotel in Dallas, sitting at Starbucks, meeting with people. For those that are in Dallas but may be unaware, The Crescent Court offices is home to about 85% of the Hedge Funds and Securities Attorneys offices in Dallas.<br><br>One of the subjects you&#39;ve taught us about is having an alignment of interests with whom we want to do business with. The question is how does one create this when it doesn&#39;t exist yet because a relationship is just forming.<br><br>I have found that everyone likes to talk about themselves, the deals they&#39;ve closed or the big deals they are doing. I am just as guilty of this and I think you once said that in your everyday business, which we don&#39;t all see, is that you constantly see this.<br><br>What I do and anyone here can do this. I research the heck out of the person I am meeting with. If I know they are an investment banker for a big firm with multiple offices, I will search The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, The Dallas Business Journal or the same publication from their area, their firms own website. I want intel on this person, why?<br><br>Because how impressive is it to sit there and be able to say, Congrats on your teams success with that deal in Miami or I see you orchestrated that credit facility with such and such in Philadelphia, tell me about it.<br><br>When you can make someone feel like you went the extra mile to find out about them, you give the impression that you want to really do business with them and when you bring them a deal they are known to work with, your creating an alignment of interests.<br><br>Of course there will always be that person who thinks your a suck up and may say no to doing any business at all.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Since this event in Las Vegas is going to be your last, I think I speak for those that are not going when I say, we wish you were not stopping, but some times its better to leave while on top.<br><br>I can only imagine what this event is going to cost you. have you given any thought into doing a live streaming type of preview and charge about $195.00 per person to attend , sort of like pay per view.<br><br>At $195.00, they get to attend live but from their living room or office, etc., video of the sessions after they attend, etc.<br>If you got 2500 people @ 195.00 each, you would gross $487,500.00, probably enough to cover your costs.<br><br>I was thinking about this as a suggestion.        </p>

          Hi,<br>During the call this morning, AJ suggested I contact &quot;Ask Andrew&quot; with my question.<br>So...I&#39;m a commercial mortgage broker in the San Francisco Bay Area, and have provided several loans for a developer client during the past 6 months.  They buy small commercial properties - ranging from $1 million to $5 million (industrial, mobile home parks, residential development and flex office in Northern California) that need some improvements, entitlements, or other value add.  At the completion of the work they flip the properties and make a nice profit.  <br>They don&#39;t have deep pockets and have been bringing in outside investors with whom they have a professional acquaintance for equity on their deals - they typically property at 50%, with 50% equity.  Those investors are starting to get a little &quot;bitchy&quot; by throwing their weight around in an unproductive (and unprofessional) way.  The result is clients want to bring in new investors to fund their deals, and they asked me to lead that effort for them.<br>On the call this morning I asked AJ for some guidance on how to price my services to these developers, in terms of points and equity interest I should receive as compensation for bringing them new equity investors.  AJ drew a blank on the question and suggested I might need to buy another product, and that you could better advise me.<br>Can you suggest how to price the deals I&#39;m asking about or (more likely), do you have suggestions about a product that could help me with my pricing dilemma?<br>Also, I was out of town (in Iowa) from last Friday until Tuesday night (with no regular internet access) and didn&#39;t see the scripts offered in Sal&#39;s email on Sunday.  I saw Sal&#39;s email Wednesday morning, but it was too late to download the scripts.  I also saw they would be offered later for $97.00, so can I buy those scripts?<br>Thank you.<br>Dennis<br>        </p>

          Dennis: <br><br>Retail investors are – as a rule – a huge pain in the ass. They don’t understand markets, deals and like to pretend they are the big man/woman on campus. <br><br>If they have a business plan, which during this preliminary point all I would need to see is their: <br><br>1.  *Bios.*<br>Who they are and what they do. Resumes, etc. <br><br>2.  *Deal Sheet.*<br>A list of deals they’ve done. Includes: deal name, asset type, basis they bought at, basis they exited out, return to investors; <br><br>Then that would be enough to see if they qualify for a JV Equity Facility. Meaning they have a checkbook that requires 2 signatures (ours and their’s…)<br><br>Review your Private Equiteer training (JV vs Fund Structures) for more info on this. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;ve invested in a few Dandrew products - DIP Financing, Hooked on Overages, Capital Syndicator, Mezz Financing &amp; Pref. Equity, Arbitrageur, and recently bought your Briefcase.  But I&#39;m not a Private Equiteer (unless it&#39;s known by a different name), and don&#39;t see anything in what I have that&#39;s called &quot;JV Equity vs. Fund Structures&quot;.  I&#39;ll be the first to say I may well be missing something.  Where can I find the info on Private Equiteer or &quot;JV Equity vs. Fund Structures&quot;?<br>As I wrote the various products (above), it occurred to me that you could probably suggest the order in which I study them.  I would appreciate your help with that also.<br>Thanks.<br>Dennis        </p>

          Hi Sal...What&#39;s the sentiment that a seller of a note should have if they have a 12% note selling it at 8%.  I&#39;m concerned that the buyer would see the original 12% yield and feel like they are being robbed.  How should I handle this?  Thanks, Hurol        </p>

          I asked this question because I know a source for 12% interest NOO loans and the idea I had was to sell it off to retail investors at 8% interest yield...Is this above board? I ran some quick numbers on it and the gains are substantial ( I will have to go back though and check the ltv&#39;s)        </p>

          Yes. You can do this. Of course. it hasppens all day long. Just the more savvy and sophisticated investor won&#39;t buy into these. <br><br>But the guy who desperately wants 8% *desperately* will buy these all day long. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Hurol,<br>I started in this business brokering note trades. As long as your fee is not out of the ordinary, you should not meet with resistance. Case in point, on a $50,000.00 note your not going to be fair in charging more than 1 to 1.5 points.<br><br>Don&#39;t fall victim to what these note courses tell you to charge, they are not realistic.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I had to jump off the call today and get onto a call for the medical project but wanted to comment on the guys deal he went into with you and AJ. This is for those looking at their first deal.<br><br>Sal has taught me to look more at the inner workings of the deal outside of the players to get at the real story of the deal and not what the country music love song highlights.<br><br>I look at deals daily with assumable mortgages and to the untrained eye, these look like selling points in the opportunity and they aren&#39;t selling points as much as red flags. <br><br>First, just because the loan is assumable doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s assumable for you or your client. The holder of that loan is going to want a very strong entity coming in. They don&#39;t want to have a good loan turn bad. <br><br>Next, you have to look at how long the investor is going to be in the deal. If they are paying $15,000,000.00 for a property and the NOI is $500,000.00 or even $1,000,000.00, how long is the investor going to be in the deal at it&#39;s worse case scenario.<br><br>The next thing to look at is what are the avenues available to get out of the deal and retire the capital and debt stacks. Can they refinance? is the timing of the market optimum for selling the property, what is the viable exit strategy.<br><br>I just wanted to pass these thoughts on.        </p>

          Rick,<br>My brother used these guys. They are reasonable compared to others and I believe it was like $99.00 upfront and you pay in installments. They run your credit immediately so they have up to the minute data. If your client would have issues with another inquiry in their credit report, he probably won&#39;t use them.<br><br>Definitely worth it.        </p>

          Sal<br><br>Would it be possible to get some business references from past banks that Dandrew have closed portfolios with, along with say purchasing history of say the past 3 years or so of distressed assets purchases (Bulk REO &amp; NPL) and these would greatly help while we wait for the proof of funds to be sorted out.  I haven&#39;t had any banks ask me for POF yet, but I think a company profile including some references from past deals from our funding source would be greatly beneficial. <br><br> I have gotten some interest from lenders but they are very slow to move and I really want to make the best impression possible, as some are telling me stories of bad experiences from flaky companies and are now very hesitant.,  and now want additional information from past buying experience.<br><br>It could be something along the lines of a document saying that  Dandrew purchased X amount of non performing paper last quarter / year  and is looking to spend Y amount for the next quarter / year .  In addition to saying something along the lines that last year we closed on deals with such and such a bank.  Something a long the lines of what was included in the DIP autoresponder scripts message # 1, but a little bit more detailed and relevant to the Bulk REO/ Arbitrage side of the business.  <br><br>Rudy Richard        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is the latest update on the medical project. We have come to an agreement in principle on the property. We agreed to do a master lease on the property. One payment of $50,000.00 per year. The owner gets a seat on the board and will provide consulting services on the medical management side of the business for a 10% equity stake in the entire project.<br><br>Were going to meet with the architect and contractor tomorrow and do a walk through and get the complete construction and design costs in line and from this I can move to the next phase of the financials.<br><br>We&#39;ve begun discussions with a finance company who will finance patients. What were going to do is receive 10% of the cost of the procedure up front, then setup a payment plan for remainder and then sell the contract to this company. This firm will run the credit, draft the docs and pay us immediately.<br><br>This financial arrangement will be a selling point in the capital raise presentation because we are showing the investors how income will be generated and protected, outside of the cash paying patients and were not accepting insurance so there is no claims to deal with.<br><br>This is where we are at right now.        </p>

          sal,<br>I just watched the MHP deal in one of the looking over your shoulder training. I live in mobile home parkville. In North Texas, this is huge business and some of these parks are 200 to 500 pads, just mammoth in scope.<br><br>I am willing to bet for the right price, these could be purchased at attractive prices. Are you still entertaining these types of deals? what is your exact criteria as far as # pads, desired NOI, crietria for owned vs. rented, if owned and park is collecting lot rent, what is the minimum lot rent that makes it attractive, is self managed more attractive or is professional management more attractive, yes/no on seller financing.<br><br>I am always looking for deals and there are certainly deals in this asset class, here and I agree, they are cash cows and really a wave of the future.        </p>

          Sal, <br>I am learning the importance of not only qualifying the deal but the players as well. I&#39;ve concluded you can have the best deal but if you have players in the deal that don&#39;t bring value, the whole deal loses value.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is where I&#39;m at on this deal, what I have uncovered. It&#39;s a 55 plus mobile park community. 5 star level property with room to expand. Property is at 137 acres. No rent control and well established. On lake, all double wides. Stable cash flow w/ no distress. Lot rents are $382, $390, $409, $437 and $483 depending on lot location in park. Park uses 37 acres of the 137 acres. 100 additional acres for expansion or development.<br><br>2013 year end P&amp;L was Gross Income from all sources of $1,291,422.56 Total net operating income was $723,210.83.<br><br>This has an assumable loan on it. They are asking $14,000,000.00, however I believe that with the economy still in its current condition, the fact that there are not too many buyers, I believe there is a play here.<br><br>The strategy I think to make a play is to acquire the property net of the assumable loan. You obtain an appraisal or BPO on the 100 acres and do a joint venture with a developer. Depending upon the permissible use of this 100 acres, you sell off the 100 acres to the developer or a buyer.<br><br>The value in this deal I think is if you take the value of the park and the value of the 100 acres and add it together, and you back out the cost to acquire, you can make a sizable profit. I believe there could be an opportunity to a DPO on the assumable loan and add that debt service costs back into the Income of the property.<br><br>Now for the risk. The risk is that the seller may be asking too many times EBITA to make this worthwhile even with the income, NOI, the additional acreage. They may have invested too much money into the property and are trying to get that back out.<br><br>I&#39;m waiting in the first qtr 2014 numbers to see if there have been any dramatic changes in the numbers, too see if there have been any rent increases and as a result, a potential vacancy increase.<br><br>I&#39;m also going to contact the zoning board to see what the 100 acres is zoned for and to get an idea of what is happening in the area to see if this becomes a big box retailing growth area.<br><br>If big boxes are coming and the zoning permits for it or can be changed for it, there is significant upside in selling the 100 acres to one of those guys.<br><br>I will keep you posted.        </p>

          What if we did this deal structured in the following way. $10,000,000.00 cash to close now, $3,000.000.00 deferred for 18 months and we bring in a big box retailer to buy the 100 acres. We sell each acre at $85,000.00 per acre or $8,500,000.00. $3,000,000.00 deducted from sale proceeds leaves $5,500,000.00. Deduct this figure from the $13,000,000.00 paid and your in at a basis of $7,500,000.00.<br><br>We JV on this, I come in and manage this project hands on earning my back end equity piece from sweat equity.        </p>

          How about structuring it as follows...<br><br>Purchase price: $13,000,000.00 with $10,000,000.00 cash paid at closing<br>Assumable Loan: We assume this debt<br>Land placed into a LLC and we setup a equity share arrangement. We sell the LLC for $8,700,000.00 and we give the seller of the park, $1,000,000.00 from these proceeds.<br><br>The seller receives $11,000,000.00 total from the sale, which is equivalent to have received all cash anyway. <br><br>Out of the $7,700,000.00 balance, we do a DPO on the assumable loan, offering $500,000.00 for the debt and retiring it.<br><br>Of course the deal is contingent upon the values of both the park and the land proving out. I would go to California on a weekly basis and manage the deal and carry out all the initiatives to make the deal go as planned.        </p>

          Yes. We ignore these. Why? <br><br>Because these folks are looking to merely list their assets to have unsophisticated and inexperienced investors jump in and do all the brain damage of pricing these assets – only to say, “thanks, but no thanks”. <br><br>So, don’t be a sucker. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I got an email request that falls somewhat in a gray area so I&#39;m asking if we can do this. Its sort of grocery anchored, with NOI in line with the loan amount requested. If it was a string of dog kennels I would know the answer. But its borderline, so should I pursue this or decline:  <br><br>I&#39;m looking for $5 mil loan to purchase a package deal of 3 superamerica gas stations c/stores w/liquor franchises chain in Minnesota. The acquisition includes businesses with real estate.<br>The yearly gross revenue is $25 mil.<br>The net is $1.2 mil a year. after all the operating expenses, fees, the mortgages, the taxes and the pay roll are paid.<br>The market value of the businesses and the real estate is $7.5 mil<br>The stations can sale easily for $2.5 mil each.<br>I have 25 years experience in this Industry. I worked for oil companies managing the retail divisions. I also owned and operated similar businesses.<br>Our objective is to expand ,acquire more gas stations ,become a jobber ,sale fuel to other gas stations and dealers.<br>The loan will go directly to the seller(Oil company) to purchase this chain of gas stations.<br>Because of my Extensive Experience in this Industry The Oil company will put 20% for the down payment.<br>The Deal can be done one Gas station c/store at the time or the entire chain at once.<br>If you think you have the capability or what it takes to get me the other 80% of the Loan Contact me.        </p>

What is the value of the real estate and what is the capital stack. What is the value of the business seperate from the real estate.<br><br>What is the lease arrangement with the franchise and what is the franchise agreement in terms of royalties, having to use one supplier, How many years is the lease for.<br><br>How many gallons of fuel is pumped on a daily basis.

          Sal, <br>I recently had a visit to  my offices from a gentleman I once had a deal going with in Austin that Peter turned down. The deal was for a student housing project at University of Texas that turned into a development deal and it was not doable.<br><br>He asked me if we are still in the same boat of not funding student housing and I told him yes, we are not in the business of ground up development. He said look, we are ourselves now in a position of having to locate properties already built that are dated, acquiring these and out of our own resources, funding the rehab/conversion but we may be needing funding to acquire.<br><br>I informed him that we would enjoy working with him and his firm on this. he asked about fees and points and  I quoted him 65 to 70% first, remainder to be hard cash equity that is seasoned and verifiable. I told him that if he wanted to cross colllateralize with another asset that is free and clear, he can pledge that. I quoted him 12 to 14% interest, interest only, 1 to 3 year term, 1 to 3 points.<br><br>He asked if they can buy down the interest and I said we can discuss this once we have a live deal in front of us. I told him that I need a bio of all the principals including himself and a brief overview of the project, time frame for needing the funds, exact sources and uses, where their equity is coming from, and a deal sheet of previous student housing projects they have completed and who they have funded through in the past. I also provided a list of the five data points obviously without Dandrews identity listed.<br><br>He told me that they dislike their previous funders and are looking to establish a new source. I told him to get all this together and we will work the deal at that time.<br><br>Any additional information you need to see?        </p>

          On the previous go around, the deal was a ground up development deal. I wanted to be firm and let him know that if he wants to send deals where they want ground up monies, were not in that space. <br><br>If they have projects where they can acquire a property such as a multi family and convert it then send it. I find that  sometimes I just have to be firm. I have no interest in wasting Dandrew&#39;s time.        </p>

          Here is what they want to do. They want to acquire multi family properties that are available as a REO or in some level of near vacancy, acquire them, rehab them, using their own resources and then market them as student housing properties that are upscale.<br><br>They will charge a monthly rent on a per room basis. They are offering to possibly pay the first six months of debt service immediately after closing, so they get ahead of the game.         </p>

          Sal,<br>This just came over this morning. It&#39;s a tape I received an overview email on. It&#39;s a tape of loans. <br><br>Portfolio UPB: $3.4 M<br>Total # Assets: 89<br>Average Loan Size: $41,549.00<br>Interest Rate Weighed Average: 9.7%<br>Lien Position: First Position across entire pool<br>Collateral locations: Nationwide<br>Collateral Type: Residential 1-4 Family.<br><br>I took a page from your strategies on the Bulk Live Videos, which is to get a overview first, then if it&#39;s worth a looksie, then get the tape.<br><br>Here&#39;s where I think the play is at. It&#39;s all firsts, residential, small portfolio but still above the minimum $2M. The loan balances are not very high which signals a potential to be closed out fairly soon. There is the potential to get the loan refinanced to buy us out and there is a potential to offer a DPO to the payor. Are these viable impressions?<br><br>The one concern I have is the loan size of $41,549.00. The risk is that the property values will be low and that&#39;s why the average loan is what it is.<br><br>Once I get the tape, should I send it?        </p>

          Sal, a little clarification please regarding DIP. I am looking at Chap 11 on Pacer.gov and going to the individual cases. Open the attorney list and see the list of &#39;creditors and attorneys&#39; and &#39;debtor and attorneys&#39;. Sometimes under the listing for the debtor it will be &#39;debtor in possession&#39;. Does this mean that a DIP is already working?        </p>

          Sal,<br>One of the opportunities you&#39;ve helped a lot of us get into is the consulting business. The intellectual capital you&#39;ve provided has been tremendous in getting us in the door.<br><br>I&#39;ve seen a few here mention this a few times. My business has evolved more into that of a consultancy, really just on its own. It&#39;s been exciting, it&#39;s been challenging and I&#39;ve been documenting everything I&#39;ve been doing.<br><br>My struggle has been in pricing my services where I&#39;m getting fairly compensated for my work. I&#39;ve come up with a formula. Please provide some insight.<br><br>First, I have my exploratory call and client analysis. I&#39;m charging $500.00 for this, paid up front. This is a 1 hour job. I&#39;m essentially getting to know my client, what they want to accomplish, what they have done, their strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Next I have what I call financial tooling and re-tooling. This starts at $1500.00 paid up front and once this three hour time is exhausted, it&#39;s $250.00 per hour after. This is where I look at the deals they are doing, look at revenues, costs, losses, etc. I have an accounting degree, so this is stuff I know.<br><br>Next I have my Next Level Session. This is where we look at how they take a project to the Next Level. This is business, marketing and day to day operational plans. Did they source out funds yet, what did they say, did they put their best foot forward. We look at their chosen capital provider, can that provider actually fund their project, etc. This fee will be be $5000.00 with $2500.00 paid upfront, remainder 15 days later.<br><br>Now we move to Operation Deal. This is where we put together the five data points, the pitch book, marketing materials, financials, strategy for structuring the deal, put together the team which consists of financial, legal, compliance, brokerage, and others and we move forward.<br><br>I&#39;m charging  $10K for the pitch book alone and $15,000.00 for the remainder and of course im looking to craft in a equity piece if the project can support it.<br><br>My question is, am I charging too much, am I missing something?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I think one of the things that could be confusing those here is just what kind of deals can they submit. Good case in point would be the banker level submitting loan pools.<br><br>I think that saying look at the products sheets could be too general in nature.Another case in point. On the Structured products sheet, it says Land, however in order to submit those deals, you have to have purchased the Land Financier product. <br><br>A cheat sheet of sorts would be helpful, so those who really cannot submit those deals, will not waste their time as well as Dandrews. Any thoughts?        </p>

          Sal,<br>Wouldn&#39;t it be beneficial for those in the banker program to obtain a bio of the borrower as a standard operational protocol? I see the questions here about potential deals and your replies asking about the sponsor-operators experience with the type of deal they want to undertake.<br><br>I want to add this in for those reading this and trying to find their first deal. You will get many opportunities, especially if you have the credibility website. Many will never even be in your wheelhouse or Dandrews.<br><br>If someone is asking for a loan to buy an apartment building, has zero money for a earnest money deposit and has to call everyone in their family for the due diligence fees and the biggest deal they have done to date is a rehab on a triplex, chances of you getting this funded is slim. Its not even the monies needed, that issue can be solved with a partner, a JV structure, etc.<br><br>What cannot be overcome is experience. Look at it this way. You own a truck repair place and you need to hire someone and you get one person who interviews with you. If all they have done is car brakes at some quick repair place, are you going to hire them to repair diesel truck engines? probably not.<br><br>You have to not only qualify your deal, you also need        </p>

          Sal,<br>Many have asked me where I find companies with which to contact for opportunities. I use many resources, however, I do use a publication named Scottsman Guide.<br><br>They have a residential edition as well as a commercial edition. I use the residential edition to source potential sellers of loans. I get to see through their ads what they are lending on and this then triggers what types of assets they would possibly want to sell.<br><br>In the commercial edition, I can see through their ads of what they are lending on and determine if they may have commercial notes they want to move off of balance sheets, if they have funds that they want to finance out of that we can leverage, as well as other opportunities.<br><br>I thought I would pass this along. You can access this through Google, they have a digital edition online.        </p>

          Three quick Loopnet related questions: <br>1.I was asked by a broker I contacted through Loop net whether we do HUD loans or just cmbs. Any suggestions as to a response?<br>2. Since we are sourcing for acquiring property, what data points should we request from the broker, other than length of the remaining term the owner is willing to finance?<br>3. What is our exit strategy for these acquisitions?<br><br> Thanks again for the infographic.        </p>

          Sal, thank you. I spoke with the sponsor today and rescheduled for 9am Pacific time in the morning to do some research. I have been going through all the webinars and training from everything you sent me and trying to run my business from what you taught me. The DIP financing portion is part of my website and I don&#39;t have the funds right now to get what I need to know for the morning. Eventually I will get it. This deal is probably way out of my league but what can I do in the meantime to get prepared?         </p>

          Dexter: <br><br>No. Hard money lenders are not affiliated with banks. But sometimes hard money lenders get what’s called “*credit facilities*” from other banks. This is adding leverage to what they have. <br><br>For example, if a hard money lender has $5mm raised in investor equity, he can get a loan for an additional $5mm (or in good times $10mm). <br>So now for $5mm, he’s making points and fees and interest income on $10mm. What a wonderful country, right? <br><br>Except leverage can destroy you if you don’t know what you’re doing. And I’m here to tell you, Dexter, that many hard money lenders screw up operationally, and then blow up. <br><br>So, then if you’re thinking like your pal Sal, you go to the bank, offer $4mm for the defaulted loan secured against the $10mm portfolio, and foreclose and get $10mm worth of assets for…. You guessed it! $4mm. So we would add $6mm to our net worth because we leverage our brains. <br><br>Now, that’s what you call Grave Dancing. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I had a call today from a broker who actually put me onto a call with a seller. The first question I asked is are you the legal owner of the assets and do you house the files at your office or through a storage facility.<br><br>Most brokers don&#39;t even know what a storage facility is and what the significance of theses are. I was on the phone with the seller and I&#39;m getting the tape. The broker on this deal is his attorney who has a lot of expertise with note dispositions and trades.<br><br>Anyway, the broker said that he would like to partner with my firm on deals. He realizes just how funds dislike broker deals. His idea is he will locate the deals and screen the sellers and I bring the buyers to the deal and we split fees 50/50 after expenses.<br><br>I informed him that my capital provider and fund does not entertain broker deals and he said he meets with this resistance everywhere that he connects with real sellers.<br><br>My question I am guessing would be since deals would be coming from my firm technically and my partner and I are splitting the fees and points, would this in Dandrew&#39;s view still be a broker deal?        </p>

          James. <br><br>when we send you your incentives, anything you promised the other broker or 3rd party comes out of those proceeds. Not ours. <br><br>So if we send you a wire at close for 40K, its your responsibility to pay your referrals from that pool of 40K. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, <br>I wanted to be certain I can submit these deals to you. Every opportunity I feel is an opportunity to make money. I think this is a great way to bring about deals. I like JV&#39;s a lot.         </p>

          Dan, <br><br>This refers to Self Storage Facilities. These are really just cement slabs with steel doors that hoarders use to store their crap in for a monthly fee. <br><br>These were also over build duing the late 2000s when every doctor and accountant wanted to become a “developer”. So there is a supply and demand issue. Too much supply. Not enough demand. So the price goes down. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Real Estate Investing Conference New York City April 24:<br><br>Sal, I did attend today the NY City investor conference as an Exhibitor, and I had the opportunity to give my 2 min “Elevator Speech” (I was waiting for your help on that…I think you have forgotten about me); I was really impressed meeting investors who came not only from US, but from Europe, and Asia, just for this event! <br><br>The funny part of my NY city adventure was trying to sell my financial services to Ziel Feldman, the founder of HFZ Capital Group, who purchased the notes securing 303 East 51st Street, 20 West 40th Street, The Setai at Wall Street (40 Broad Street) and One Madison Avenue, as well as properties located at 11 East 68th Street and 11 Beach Street, all located in New York City. I did not know about him and his investing portfolios when I explained my Mezzanine $2 mil-$10 mil loans…but I had a very good laugh afterwards. <br><br>The interesting part to share with you is that the CEO of a capital creation company was looking for Equity Partners for a sky rise building in NY City. I told him that I was interested, and we exchanged business cards…more to come<br>        </p>

          Sal, I do take your concerns seriously. Although I feel pretty strong in analyzing commercial real estate deals, I am pretty weak in JV because I am a beginner in this area. As I said before I have many JV deals, and that’s why I need your help in guiding me here. Before I call the sponsor to ask the hard questions, I need to know what these questions would be, so thank you for clarifying that.<br><br>I was also sure that this was a Purchase JV, not a construction one, since the sponsor is using somebody else to pay for the construction expense; so as you see…it’s a learning curve. <br><br>I will get all the info you requested, but I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s fair to use your time if you cannot benefit from this deal, but all you want is to help me, which is greatly appreciated. <br>        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I will benefit from this deal if it checks out to be a real, legitimate deal. Believe me. And so will you. <br><br>And if you need help on the JV stuff, go back and go through the JV Equity vs Fund Structures of the Private Equiteer program. That will make things much clearer for you<br><br>Sal        </p>
