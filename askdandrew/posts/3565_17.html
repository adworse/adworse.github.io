          Hi, I use a property management company for my rental properties and the owner is also an investor and want&#39;s to acquire commercial properties purely on an asset based lending scenario. Basically he want&#39;s to have cash available to seize opportunities when they hit the market. To be honest I have gone through your course probably over 6 months ago and I don&#39;t have time to go back an re-review the lending criteria. The question is- do you do commercial asset based lending?  If so, what is the LTV and loan criteria?<br>Thanks!            </p>

          Yes. We do. <br><br>This guy is asking a question that everyone wants. But here&#39;s the sticking point: does he have deal flow to set up a credit or equity facility to use this? <br><br>Min size for this is $15mm. <br><br>How did you qualify this guy? Does he have any commercial real estate? Or is he a dreamer and a flake? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Nicholas. <br><br>Ask and you shall receive. Although *patience is a virtue...*<br><br>(Who else would do this for you - on demand?! Your pal Sal, that&#39;s who...)<br><br>Copy and paste what I have below in *bold*. Please be certain to change it to fit your tastes. <br><br>*We are a capital provider, and our core business is providing debt and equity. With respect to credit, we’re not a bank, so we really don’t care if you have any bankruptcies or bad credit out there. We only care about your experience and the quality of the asset. Banks consider some people “radioactive” because they’ve taken a DPO or have an involuntary bankruptcy lurking around in their past; we don’t care about any of that. We’re sophisticated investors and we only report to ourselves, so we can structure the risk around what comes up. We understand that no deal is the same and no sponsor is the same. We want sponsors who are experienced and can source a lot of deal flow. <br>A lot of our business turns out to be people who’ve been asked by their lender to buy their note back at a discount—performing or nonperforming. The lender may have a political reason to move certain assets on their balance sheet… an asset concentration risk… too much money with one sponsor…or just too much money in one area. This is where we like to work.*        </p>

          HI Sal, <br>I am new to your Program, learning my way around the site.  So bear with me if I didn&#39;t post this question in the right spot.  I just had an inquiry, are you open to lending  &quot;3.5 million refi commercial institutional for a gas station / multiple  vendors like a Flying J scenario? Looking to beat 3% or less&quot;?  <br><br>Thanks for the feedback.<br><br>Michele         </p>

          Michele<br><br>Welcome aboard! And this is the correct spot for these types of questions. <br><br>Can you tell me the following: <br>1.  What does “commercial institutional” mean? Seems like this was copied and pasted. <br><br>2.  What does “looking to beat 3% or less?” mean. <br><br>3.  How many others of these do they own? <br><br>Let me know where you’re seeing this from and what they come back to you with. My guess its from a broker who is not that bright... <br><br>Thanks!<br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am working with a very experienced investor that is buying shopping centers from banks as reos in a tier 1 market. He used to build the centers but it is cheaper to buy one already in existence. They just closed on another one last Monday. They are already looking at more and all are under $2mm. He was asking me about possible debt &amp; equity funding for a package deal (as yet to be determined) to elevate the funding request to be above your minimum of $3mm. <br>Is this something that Dandrew would consider?        </p>

          After initial review of your training materials, it seems very much like intermediaries function as brokers. How is it we would not need a mortgage broker&#39;s license and securities license? (I realize you are in Nevada, where rules are looser than in other states.) Do we operate under your license as a JV? Please explain.        </p>

          I remember it being stated that we did not need a license, but not how or why. What is described in training so far, including being an intermediary, is similar to acting as a broker between parties. Please clarify specifically how we avoid being counted under SEC securities and/or mortgage broker rules. Thanks.        </p>

          I am having trouble navigating the site.  Sal wanted to answer me on AskDandrew.  I didn&#39;t even know where to do it, and it disappeared into Commercial Triage.  I need to find out how to structure a personal deal, so that once that is out  of the way, I can have the leeway to further pursue my work as an Intermediary (AvantiCapitalServices.com).  I will try to add the thread here.  Before that, is there a phone #?

          Still working on this project.  Will maybe have a web site next week (Flory-Mill.com) put together by Marc Boucher at iNet.  So, it is a small deal, I understand this.  Yet I will be holding myself out as a Banker, seeking/placing larger sums of money, but can&#39;t manage to find myself this small amount for my office building?  I&#39;m taking it &#39;subject to&#39;, and now am thinking that a mezz piece should be put on it to bring it up to 65% LTV, or so (150,000 mezz).  Alternatively, would a new conventional first to 65% (about $420k) make sense - with a letter of credit to take to the bank? (Won&#39;t pass muster at conventional lenders on my own, otherwise, at present.  I do have good income, but need to consolidate (with part of the 150,000) to rebuild my score) - then my 10,000 to 14,000/mo will suffice.  I need this consolidation/working capital sooner rather than later.  I NEED HELP to figure this out in order to put it behind me.  So that I can concentrate on business, and stop treading water.        </p>

          Well, I realize my tiny deal doesn&#39;t work with this organization because of its size.  I just wish I could obtain actionable counsel on how to solve this problem - The know how should be here, if anywhere.        </p>

          Greg<br><br>The problem with this is that it&#39;s not a desirable asset (a mill) in a part of the nation that is considered to be a legacy of the rust belt (Lancaster County) where the key event has to be executed on a make-or-break situation for the deal to be successful. <br><br>So, to be frank, you are infatuated with a deal that makes no sense to anyone - primarily because its in your hometown or close to your home. Its also because you&#39;ve not done much marketing to find these deals as your LinkedIn profile (as we discussed before in response to another post of yours) isn&#39;t set up yet. <br><br>Running a correlation to this, I live in NYC and we don&#39;t do deal sin NYC as they mostly too competitive in our backyard, therefore, we go to other areas of a country. <br><br>I hope this helps. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>Everything helps, thanks.<br><br>I was getting involved with this little building before signing up with Dandrew, and yes it is as if I am buying a house to live in.  Just a personal RE acquisition.<br><br>I know that I, too, should do as you and get business from elsewhere.  I haven&#39;t started a push yet.  Web site has been set up, I&#39;m working on LinkedIn, and I&#39;m preoccupied with this building and my other properties and with my day &#39;job&#39;.<br><br>Rust belt?  The largest component to the local economy is TOURISM because of the Amish and other PA Dutch attractions.  A lot of New Yorkers &amp; Jersey-ites visit here for that (perhaps you did).  Then comes AGRICULTURE - the most productive county in the US (non-irrigated - Fresno &amp; Salinas Counties in CA do more, but each is 10 times larger and require water to be brought in, and then they can grow all year).  Next comes INDUSTRY - printing, defense, machinery, etc. (RR Donnelley, Case New Holland, Armstrong World Industries, Harley Davidson - next county over)  In other words, unemployment is low because of the economy&#39;s diverse and varied industries.  It is a very wealthy county - mostly not ostentatious, with a low cost of living.<br><br>I might be able to tap into monied investors from the area, if not local deals, once established.<br>----------------------------<br>Having said all that, I wouldn&#39;t mind help in at least structuring my personal deal, or, if I can find some private money on my own, to do the paperwork professionally.<br><br>I am not looking for money, per se, by all my entreaties.  Just expert advice (which you have given, granted)<br><br>You don&#39;t need to respond to this, I get the message, and I appreciate your having looked at my concerns.<br><br>Take care,<br><br>Greg<br><br><br>        </p>

          Greg, <br><br>Lancaster aside, I think its best you get the Commercial Real Estate Capital Syndicator. If you&#39;re passionate about this deal, you&#39;re going to need to learn how to raise money around one-off deals. <br><br>Here&#39;s why, any advice I tell you will lead to more questions and then more questions. So you&#39;re probably better off learning this from the get go. And use SALISMYPAL and you&#39;ll get 30% off. <br><br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=434<br><br>I will tell you that one of my rules is to look at the number and the deal dispassionately. If you can prove this to the investors, you will get the money you need. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          My potential sponsor asks:<br><br>&quot;I wanted to know if you do construction financing in Texas? We currently own the land worth approximately 2M, and are looking for approximately 10-12M to build 150 units (Phase I) of our project. The total project will be up to 300 units and will cost approximately $20M&quot;.<br><br>Sal, my pal: Are you going to say &quot;No new construction&quot;?<br><br>Here&#39;s my question: if the sponsor had lots of collateral commercial property, can we not cross-collateralize it --  in addition to &quot;the land worth approximately 2M&quot; that they have -- and thus cover whatever are the risks of new construction, that we wish to avoid by your policy of not funding new construction?<br><br>        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;m a Private Banker that upgraded to JV Equiteer.  I recently got through the<br>Bulk REO training and have built a list of banks to call - which I&#39;ll be doing in <br>the next couple of days.  The reason I&#39;m writing is to ask if you can put together<br>something regarding bulk reo and Non-performing assets that I can add to my website<br>for credibility?<br><br>-Hurol<br>P.S. If I don&#39;t hear anything form you, I&#39;ll take it you are busy...if so I&#39;ll resend this on Monday.        </p>

          Hi Sal, I want to wish you and the team well this week.  I have been drumming up contacts and building relationships attempting to uncover deals in your wheelhouse to submit. <br>I have come up with a very experienced sponsor who works in distressed assets and notes who is putting together his bio and game plans and special sauce to get to me for submission to access capital to increase his deal flow in both areas.  I will get that in as soon as he provides it to me.<br>He also is putting me in touch with some other sponsors who are in a different space than Dandrew (specifically business oriented) that are in need of capital assistance.  My question to you is do you have relationships with other funds who target energy, IT or healthcare sectors that you could send me to for those matters?<br>I appreciate all that you and your team have provided and VERY much look forward to getting traction.<br>Your pal, Robert        </p>

It’s not what I really focus on. <br><br>However, here’s some advice: you’ll see that the legitimate players are *dedicated* to only one vertical and industry. Beware of the “jack-of-all-trades”. So oil players deal with oil only. Healthcare is only specialized with healthcare players. So on and so forth. <br><br>And of course, start with LinkedIn to back into the meaningful players. <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal         </p>

          Sal, <br>Regarding DIP, I have a company preparing their reorganization plan to get to me for assistance.  They are an apparel manufacturing company in the US. Their real estate in country is minimal I believe, but their manufacturing facilities are much larger and owned free and clear, but are in Mexico.  Is this something we can work with?<br>Thanks        </p>

          Hi, this is Jeraldine again.  Your little old lady - 82 and counting.<br><br>First, thanks for the help on the radio interview.  It went well, but they said they couldn&#39;t provide a tape as the purpose of the free interview was to find out how I handled it.  The next interview would be taped.  They said this interview wasn&#39;t advertised, but I had done very well and the next one would be widely advertised and have thousands of listeners.  But the price was too high so I declined.<br><br>Now for my deal question.<br><br>I am brand new at this so need some advise.  <br><br>NOI $1,900,000 as is<br>Proforma: unknown - no increase until funds built up to make improvements possible.<br>Debt stack: no mortgage, no debt<br>Sources and uses: $1.3mm for purchase, prepaids and inspection.<br>Exit: wants interest only loan for 24 to 25 months, then plans to get a conventional loan and pay you back.<br><br>The story behind it:<br>In 2003 a woman got a contract from a subdivision of Pepsi to build warehouses.  This subdivision has leased the warehouses consistently for 11 years and is still leasing them.  They have a very popular product purchased by almost every American family.  It must be fresh when sold.  The warehouses are used to deliver their product to an area to be picked up by individual distributers on a daily basis.  I don&#39;t believe there is any chance that this product will cease to be very popular in the entire American culture for decades at least.  This deal is for the purchase of 3 of these warehouses from the widower, who no longer wants to be in this business and never was a part of it.<br><br>Questions, 1) Is this a good deal? 2) Are warehouses within your wheelhouse? Have I written it up correctly.<br><br>Thanks for your help.<br><br>Jeraldine<br>        </p>

          Dear Jeraldine. <br><br>Who is buying this? Why is the person asking for money telling you *&quot;unknown – no increase until funds built up to make improvements possible.&quot;*. <br><br>That to me is a red flag. Tell them to go home and do their homework. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>Following up on the discussion below, regarding calls made to banks using the FDIC Infographic; This is very helpful information. It brought a question to mind about  the information we need from a bank which has assets that it may want to move. Specifically, what is the detailed information that we need, I can surmise a certain amount from common sense, but there may be something specific that I wouldn&#39;t want to miss. Thanks        </p>

          I was on the phone today with a commercial lender who is looking for funds for a client of his to buy two Rite-Aid NNN lease properties. I told him that we normally deal with sponsors, but would inquire if we would consider looking at it. The location is Syracuse NY. The amount is $9,000,000. Should I spend any time here?        </p>

          Syracuse is rust-belt and not that attractive. <br><br>http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-06-18/death-rust-belt<br><br>What is the cap rate for these and why is he asking you, who only provides more expensive capital for this loan? <br><br>Why have other lenders turned down this deal?

          Not sure if this is the right place for me to be asking this question, but I&#39;m new here.  I signed up at the banker level to get a look and just upgraded to arbitrage level. I have some residential background, but no experience or connections on the Commercial side. Wondering where I should be focusing my learning to get ramped up as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I have to wait to view all the modules in banker level (currently waiting to view module 3 next)  so I kind of feel like a freshman walking into an advanced economic class.... any suggestions would be appreciated        </p>

          Kevin<br><br>I would listen to the most recent archive of the conference calls. <br><br>I assume you read your AskDandrew Owner&#39;s Manual and Quick Start Guide, correct? <br><br>Lastly, take a breadth. Relax. This will come as second nature to you. I know AJ is working on putting together a quick start program that may be released soon, so stay tuned, but at the end of the day, don&#39;t hesitate to submit questions and to *submit deals*.

          Sal, <br>Thanks for the response, I know your busy.<br><br>Couple more questions and I will stop bugging you before the conference: <br><br> I asked you about credibility coming out of Sarasota and you said it was Ok<br><br>1)  Do you recommend having a physical address on credibility website? <br><br>2)  What &quot;title&quot; would you recommend to be taken seriously but not overboard to start?  I am a grinder and don&#39;t care about titles, but want something credible to get going. <br><br>3) On Linkedin, any suggestions on Bio if I do not have any meaningful experience but want to still look credible?  <br><br>4) Will my current Linkedin profile conflict with new?  <br><br><br>Thanks again Sal, I appreciate you responding to these questions. I know you have a lot on your plate<br>        </p>

          Kevin:<br><br>In the order you asked. <br><br>*1.  Do you recommend having a physical address on credibility website?*<br>Not really important but a PO Box would be a good idea.<br><br>*2.  What “title” would you recommend to be taken seriously but not overboard to start? I am a grinder and don’t care about titles, but want something credible to get going.*<br>Investment Associate. This will allow for top cover and keep you from getting painted into a corner. See AskDandrew Owner’s Manual for more info on that. <br><br>*3. On LinkedIn, any suggestions on Bio if I do not have any meaningful experience but want to still look credible?*<br><br>We have the LinkedIn Leaders that you may want to look at. The website is built, but won’t be released until Thursday, so you can still get in at $97.<br><br>*Offer Expires Thursday 6/26* <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathnilrs <br><br>*4. Will my current Linkedin profile conflict with new?*<br><br>You need to have a “church and state” LinkedIn profile. I don’t know what your other profile says, but remember, in a world where text is the principle form of communication, you need to look credible and make sure your profile is congruent to your business. Do NOT co-mingle MLMs and other businesses. <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          I have Linkedin Leaders, but didn&#39;t realize I could just copy and paste that in. I was unsure if it would be a problem to have a new profile in addition to one I have now for my publishing business (they would both come up on a search and loose credibility).

One of my new partners has deep connections to wealthy investor and I am thinking family office money from Dubai that I think they would like to have Dandrew put to work for them.<br><br>What do you need from them to get the ball rolling. They are aware of my position as an Intermediary with Dandrew but don&#39;t know your name or Dandrews name per se.<br><br>I asked how liquid they are and he said they can stroke a check for $10,000,000.00 right now without blinking an eye or losing sleep. I am going to do a conference call with them middle of this week to advise what you need to see from them.<br><br>        </p>

          Yes. We see a lot of them. But it requires approval from the (special) servicer. You also hope the special servicer has the discretion to accept a DPO. Most do, some have to go back to the trusts who are the beneficiaries of the loan and that is a very tangled web.         </p>

          Sal,<br>My intern came up with a plan. Substitute an equally yielding income vehicle such as high yield treasury bonds into the securitized loan pool for the right to pull out the loan in event Servicer will fight a DPO, in order to get the servicer to agree to it. Not sure if this can be accomplished or not.        </p>

          HI Sal – Might you have any interest in a Tenant in Common owners  project.  It is managed by a “Company” that was formed by a National Realty Company.  The asset is a 95 suite hotel called Marriott Towneplace Suites which is  set up for longer stays and is located in Portland Maine.  They need a $1.7 Million dollar loan for the standard 6 yr Marriott required renovation.   The money would be used to pay for the renovation.   <br> Based on the Income capitalization valuation method a value of $6.8 Million is placed on the Suites.  It was done by using a market cap rate of 7.5% on the re-forecasted year end 2013 NOI of $513,000.<br>The loan debt stack is $0, e.g. no 1st, 2nd, etc.<br>Thanks , <br>Norm Haight<br>info@nuvisionrealtors.com<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>Someone asked me recently about how I am able to call banks and get them to be receptive and I haven&#39;t really shared what I do, but then my intern said why don&#39;t you just put it out there so the members can hear it from someone who is putting it to work. So here goes...<br><br>First thing I do is I do exactly what Sal tells us to do, use The FDIC infographic and the steps listed in their exact order. I don&#39;t deviate from it!!!<br><br>Tip... Do not reinvent the wheel, the things Sal teaches are not trial and error, they work but only if you do it the right way.<br><br>Next thing I do is I print off the entire information for each bank I find. I want to have that in front if me when I call. I then segment the banks by city and I begin to setup days I&#39;m calling. I devote one day to each city or area.<br><br>I put each bank in order by the amount of loans and reo&#39;s they have, going highest to lowest. The higher the volume, the more in trouble they are in and more likely to talk to me.<br><br>When I call, I introduce myself and my company. I always ask for the CFO, Chief Credit Officer or Director of Whole Loan Trading.<br><br>Once I get them on the phone, I re-introduce myself and simply tell them the following:<br><br>&quot;We understand that they have a significant amount of loans and oreo&#39;s that have been reported as being in a state of less than performing to some level and I would like to know how much they would need to dispose of to get their balance sheets back to a level that will put them in a position of being more healthy&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m wording it in a way that they can feel like I&#39;m genuinely trying to be a problem solver. The next thing I say to them is that we are looking for first lien position loans, performing, re-performing, scratch and dent or NPN. <br><br>It&#39;s at this point that I inform them that the volume level that they may want to dispose of may be more than we can afford, however, I am backed by a fund that is financially strong and are also providers of solutions and ask if I can bring them into the deal.<br><br>I&#39;m being up front, I&#39;m letting them know that I on my own May not be able to buy but the fund I work with, is in a position. <br><br>Then I cut them off at the what will you pay pass by informing them that bids are made as principal bids and are based upon market conditions. I also tell them if your looking for a bid right now, today without us or the fund having the benefit of the proper initial review, we will not be a player in your space.<br><br>I then ask when can I expect a tape from you and I tell them what we need to see in order to be in a position to have a successful initial bid.<br><br>I then thank them and I say, if you are aware of any other bankers who may want to talk, I am available to speak with them, Monday to Friday, 9 to 5 pm central time.<br><br>This is what I do, I do exactly what Sal teaches. Hope this is helpful.        </p>

          Sal,<br>On the call today, I believe you said that there are some great opportunities in the real estate sector that your seeing that doesn&#39;t necessarily involve properties, if your coming across great opportunities are you entering into JV&#39;s or are you buying out the operator and taking over the concept and creating a profit center?        </p>

          Hey Sal,<br>I’ve received another response from my “PLN Investors” page on my banker’s website asking to invest $1mm.  I know this is too small.  However, will you do a continuing ed on how we should handle these situations and make the best use of this section of our website?  I don’t remember one before.  Thanks.<br><br>        </p>

          Dave, <br><br>You too with the PrivateBankerIdentityKit.com website? <br><br>Well, I would contact them and a) thank them for their submission, b) ask them how they heard of your firm, and c) find out if you’re speaking to the family or just a guy who knows a guy who knows a family. <br><br>Then get back to me here with your answer. I’ll determine if I want to talk to them or not. <br><br>There are many fund managers I know where this could be easily placed and give you a nice payday. And I have a special situations deal that they may like that we’re launching after this blessed conference…<br><br>But you have to be direct. <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>The NNN net lease deals Sean discussed are obviously very specialized deals. I understand the 25 year term lease and I understand the debt piece and the basics of it. My question is this, would Dandrew come in and make a debt loan for a long term deal such as these?        </p>

          James<br><br>Good question. *No.* The reason is we&#39;re short term and the loans on these are amo&#39;ed at 22 years. These are stabilized deals where the operator can get cheap financing from a life company for this product. Not expensive bridge or equity debt. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Sal, this is a great question.  I would say I will do what&#39;s necessary to protect the investors and to ensure that our returns are kept on target. The investors and their capital and the security and fiduciary trust are of importance.<br><br>I would expect that the other fund manager will pull his weight.        </p>

          In terms of heavy lifting, I will do what is necessary on my side of the desk to make sure that investors money is protected, because they come first. However, the best course of action is to hire a team and delegate responsibilities to them. I realize where you directing my thinking towards, which is that one person can start a fund, but it is still a business that requires a team of experienced people to make it a success.        </p>

          Yes. But you have to be very careful about who you hire to do this. <br><br>Ex-wives, new in-laws, old out-laws. Don&#39;t run your business like a Greek Diner. <br><br>Each one of my graphics cost about $4 to make on Odesk for my decks. <br><br>And if you email it to me, I&#39;ll gladly critique it - *just make sure it is the best job you can do prior to sending.

          Sal, <br>Here is another update. I wanted to run this by you. I&#39;ve got the full picture I think on this...<br><br>Seller is a fund that has done 7 funds and is rolling out their 8th fund. They are doing a $20M capital raise on the 8th fund and on one, he still has $17M to spend.<br><br>They buy SFR&#39;s from banks as bulk product and then resell and hold the paper. The paper is written at 10%, 30 year amo, balloons of varying lengths.<br><br>They have pulled product across all their funds and have $130,000,000.00 in paper  and they are selling product to either raise capital or meet the stips on the funds.<br><br>They have paper across many states, Michigan is one that they know will not have as high a return as others. In some states they are getting 75% of UPB that&#39;s performing and of course less on NPN.<br><br>He wants to meet with me next Thursday at which time he will release several tapes to me. He said that on most funds they have multiple limited partners and they too have invested capital placed in their funds.<br><br>These guys are numbers guys and he said they have to have an offer that makes sense from a standpoint of returns. They understand what it is we want, there is no educating here.<br><br>He said please come ready to do business and ready to walk out with what I need to begin doing business.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I guess I am the question man this evening. If I am on the FDIC website, I can see banks that are in the process of being shut down, anyone looking at the site can see the same thing.<br><br>My question is are these a prime target to buy loan pools from and bulk OREO&#39;s from or are they too far gone once the process of shutting them down has been initiated?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;m a bit bothered this evening about something someone said awhile back and wanted to share it. I went to the POF section of AskDandrew and saw where someone wrote about joining the Arb program because of the POF and now they feel out of water, I&#39;m paraphrasing that of course.<br><br>I am bothered that someone would join just because of that one tool. I feel like the real essence of the opportunity has been missed.<br><br>Last time I checked, and hopefully I don&#39;t have to put my head in the oven over the next thing I say, but, unless we are actually becoming the buyer and borrowing funds from Dandrew, we don&#39;t need a POF. I think that if someone is IM&#39;ing the deal and they use the POF, that they could be giving the impression that they are the buyer.<br><br>I&#39;m big on being transparent, I don&#39;t lose sleep over being honest. One thing that has got me into the party on some deals is that I&#39;m transparent.<br><br>If I&#39;m the buyer, I say so and if I&#39;m the buyers rep for deals I&#39;m bringing to you, I say that I am going to bring this deal to my fund manager for their review.<br><br>I feel that the secret sauce for us is being aligned with a Dandrew.        </p>

          Jack<br><br>We&#39;ve seen a lot of our smaller, less experienced competitors get caught holding assets where the leasees have gone dark or are planning to. <br><br>Keep in mind, most developers don’t really know the general financial condition of their tenants. They just have brokers fill in the spaces. <br><br>So, read this article and then tell me, if this was your $2 or $5, or $10mm from your own retirement would you invest in JCP stock?

It will make you feel proud to be in this business, but it will also tell you how hard the consumers of these stores/products are struggling to survive. <br><br>http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-06-05/half-country-makes-less-27520-year-and-15-other-signs-middle-class-dying<br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Read both of the articles and listened again to AJ&#39;s pitch.  One of the points made by the audience was that real estate investing is local.  One question was the impact online retailers such as Amazon would have on brick and mortar stores.  Another was the effect that market cycles would have on retailers.<br><br>Regarding real estate investing being local, I contacted Tyler Young - Ardmore Development Authority to get the latest information.  Here is Tyler&#39;s response to my question.<br><br> &quot;The most accurate information I can give you on the current unemployment rate for Carter County is 3.1% as of April 2014, which was a 0.8% decrease from March. Also, Ardmore’s median Household income is $38,383 according to the US Census Bureau’s information. As for your question about the impact of the developments in the oil and gas business, as you can tell by the unemployment rating, Ardmore has certainly benefited from the advances in the industry. In addition, Ardmore has seen record highs in retail sales and building permits which can also be tied to the various developments in the energy fields. I hope this answer was helpful to you, was there anything else I could do for you? If so, please do not hesitate to ask.&quot;  <br><br>Circuit City was Ardmore&#39;s largest employer when they went out of business and it hurt Ardmore.  But as you can see from the current unemployment rate, this has been absorbed.  Michelin is another large local employer and they are expanding their manufacturing capability.<br><br>Probably the largest contributor to Ardmore&#39;s current economic/unemployment picture is the oil and gas industry and the expanding production.  The oil patch is not something that can be shut down and moved to China.<br><br>The growth in the nation&#39;s economy, such as it is, can be traced almost entirely to the energy sector.  <br><br>I am not sure what stronger economic indicators you would want in a city/region.<br><br>Regarding everyone buying everything online.  While high tech/office workers in larger cities may buy a lot/most things online, like AJ said, that is not the demographic here.  People in this demographic, while they shop online, shop locally and the teenagers use shopping as a social outing.<br><br>With the energy sector being the only bright spot on the economic horizon, that I see, I think the future of retailers in this market is much brighter than in markets that are dependent on pushing paper and not oil. <br>        </p>

          Jack, I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in Oklahoma. I like Ardmore. The largest employers in Ardmore are the Michelin Tire Plant, Dollar General Stores, Valero Energy which owns Valero Gas and C Store retailers and a few others and I believe this is why the unemployment rate has decreased. Also you have to factor in Winstar Casino, which currently employs 2300 people in many capacities.<br><br>You and I are both in DFW, you and I both know that when the energy business is booming, everything gets on a rise economically, money is in it&#39;s pleasure mode, new jobs arrive, etc.<br><br>When the energy business declines, most towns end up like Big Springs, Texas. Depressed, money is screaming bloody murder, times are bad.<br><br>The one problem with shopping malls is the online presence of many retailers. Many retailers close stores and evolve into having a huge Amazon like presence which kills mall leases. It&#39;s not easy to fill spaces. Mall owners are not going to reduce rental rates just to get someone in, unless there is a rent escalation that can be favorable at some point.<br><br>In NY, NJ, CT and PA, some mall owners will actually create rent concessions because there are other lease incentives involved that make a rent concession better for the owners.<br><br>While I cannot speak for Sal or Dandrew, I am thinking that if this mall was like a North Park or a Galleria or even Parks Mall in Arlington, they would be able to go to committee and justify giving a $3M funding. <br><br>The risk in this deal is obvious, not many national retailers are going to be beating down the doors to Ardmore OK to become tenants of this mall. If the current tenants decide they&#39;ve had enough of retail, they will leave one by one.<br><br>Case in point, a Irving Mall in Irving, Texas. If it weren&#39;t for Burlington Coat Factory, the mall would slowly die a sudden and justified death. Shoppers World will never bring continued traffic to that mall.        </p>

          If I am the sales manager for a &#39;national retailer&#39; then I am going to know who my customers are and where they live. If my customers shop on 5th Avenue or Rodeo Drive, then I know that they are not a significant portion of Ardmore.  If my customers are the working class then they are in Ardmore.  <br><br>My job as a sales manager is to put my outlets in locations where sales will be made. Am I going to look in NY, NJ, CT or PA for locations where the local economy has a 3.1% unemployment rate and a household income of $38,383? Think I could look long and hard and not find those conditions in those states.<br><br>My research department is going to tell me where my customers are and what the economic conditions are in those areas.  If the economy is based on one major company, then that area is not as attractive. If on the other hand the economy is underpinned by a diverse business/manufacturing base and the resurgence of the oil and gas production brought about by new technology that has brought new life and production levels never before seen in the oil patch, then this is going to be a place that I am interested in. I don&#39;t think that anyone thinks the increased oil and gas production is only going to last a year or so.<br><br>One of the credit tenants in this mall that has 9 years left on a 10 year lease has just been relocated to a more prominent 15,000 sq ft location and Ulta Cosmetics will be occupying a new 10,000 location which will add $210,000 to the NOI.  The owners of this mall have recently sold another mall in Ardmore at a 7% cap rate. Not exactly a fire sale.<br><br>Regarding online sales replacing retail outlets.  Like AJ said in his presentation, the demographics of this area are not the ones who buy the majority of their things online.  They are computer literate but still go to retail stores to buy what they want now. If I am looking for a &#39;big ticket item&#39; and do not need it today, then online is definitely a viable option. If I am looking for some sports gear to use this weekend or my wife is looking for cosmetics then we are shopping locally.<br><br>Regarding the Irving Mall, the changing demographics around a mall can kill it.  You could also say the same thing about the former Red Bird Mall, now Southwest Mall, in Duncanville, TX. The customer base for these malls moved. These malls then had to replace the old tenants with ones whose target customers are the ones who filled in for the former customers.<br><br>Regarding rent concessions. Rent concessions are part of life for any property that leases space, be it retail, office, multi-family, or states offering Tax Incentives to companies to get them to locate there.  Look at the current ads running on TV for NY offering 10 years tax free for locating there.<br><br>All investing involves risk.  Even not investing is risky, ever heard of inflation?  Lowest perceived risk would be Treasury&#39;s (although some could argue that this could be the riskiest of all), gold or silver (but how much control do you have on what happens there), the stock market (does anyone really believe that this is not a bubble) or real estate backed that are income producing.          </p>

          A couple of additional comments. If this mall was like a North Park or Galleria, both high end Dallas malls, I don&#39;t think that I could recommend it because the customers/demographics of their customer base is well above the $38,383 of the median Ardmore household income.  Again, you have to know who your customers are and what they buy.         </p>

          Jack,<br>I used the NY, NJ, PA markets as a point of conversation because I am a New Yorker but am here in Dallas the past twenty years. I know those markets well.<br><br>My reply to you was not for the purpose of gaining such a terse reply by you. The situation with any mall, anywhere is that you are subject to the financial conditions of the shopping public.<br><br>Just as many low wage income earners shop at high dollar malls as do wealthy individuals. Galleria Mall in Dallas has just as many used vehicles in the lot as there are Bentleys. <br><br>Shopping choices come down to people&#39;s desires more often than cost to acquire. If I were funding this deal which obviously I&#39;m not but I probably have a funder for this deal, here is how I would be viewing this.<br><br>1. I would be looking at the population of Ardmore, Oklahoma to gain a full understanding of the demographic and the median income, which is $38,000.<br><br>2. The borrower is investing $5M dollars to update a mall that still has the income of shoppers at $38K per year.<br><br>3. Where is this $5M number in the capital stack??? Are they taking debt on or is this from their own resources?<br><br>4. What is the NOI for this mall? can it fully support the capital stack<br><br>5. What happens to this mall if a developer decides to come in and build a super regional mall between Ardmore and OKC with big name national tenants who have zero issue with being out in the middle of no where and what happens. <br><br>6. What happens if a developer comes in and builds a master planned community and drives this traffic away, what happens to the ability of this ownership to support debt?<br><br>And Jack, not all National Sales Managers are bright enough to really understand markets their stores are located in. There have been many NSM&#39;s who kept a store open longer than they should have, causing a chain to go up in smoke.<br><br>Sometimes it&#39;s not always the obvious that causes a deal to go south.        </p>

          I did not mean for my reply to be terse.  My point is that the product you are selling must be aligned with the wants, needs and ability of your target customer.  I spent about 40 years in technical sales to aerospace and defense. I learned the first day that I had to identify who had a need for and could use my product.  That is the point I was making.<br><br>Shopping malls have a pull radius for the majority of their customers and while there are &#39;used&#39; cars in the parking lot of the Galleria, there are many stores there that cater to the 6 or 7 figure income shopper.  As far as &#39;shopping choices coming down to desires more often than cost to acquire&#39; I am sure that the customer who drives the 2009 Ford would rather have the 2014 S500, but then reality sets in.<br><br>All of the financials were supplied to Dandrew and yes the $5mm for renovations is in the capital stack. The NOI will support a sale at a 7% cap of $20mm+. The owners of this mall have sold another mall in Ardmore in the last 4 months at a 7 cap.<br><br>As far as a developer building a super regional mall between Ardmore and OK City would be extremely as there is not enough population density to support it.  The same could be said of a master planned community. <br><br>But then, what would happen to the cost of gold if the Alchemists finally succeed?<br><br>        </p>

          Jack<br><br>It took me about 30 mins to craft this response. Here it is. <br><br>The consumer here is a low skilled, low income wage earner who&#39;s salary and discretionary spending is increasingly restricted. <br><br>This has nothing to do with &quot;selling a product&quot;. Investors don&#39;t care about that. They see the bifurcation of the middle class into the wealthy and the poor. No middle ground. It&#39;s well known that a major reason why the middle class is in decline is the *stagnation of wages*. <br><br>While it is true that going to the mall is a fun experience for some, and a way to pass time for the seniors, that does not translate into sales to generate the profits to retailers to maintain large, expensive stores. It is highly likely that the shift to stores becoming more like showrooms, and therefore taking less space, is going to accelerate. With the logistics of next day shipping now becoming highly efficient, stores no longer need to have the space formerly required for inventory storage. Amazon and others have perfected warehouse to residential front door delivery to a science and that means less space by bricks and mortar retail. It does mean more warehouse space easily accessible to major highways and rail in urban areas. It will get harder over time to find larger tenants who need the same space they once had. *Retail as a whole remains overcapacitied.*<br><br>Many of the retail employees are lower wage people and they will be caught up in the Obamacare nightmare of what to do about insurance. The issues for large retailers is their cost of healthcare is going to rise as the requirements of what has to be covered in a policy hit premiums, and so labor costs for the retailer will rise. If you accept that online shopping is going to impact space needs and usage, and you combine it with the cost issue of labor, then you will see that paying higher rents is a problem. Lastly, as we just saw this past Christmas, retail didn’t have a promising start. Sales were down, discounting was rampant and profits at retailers were squeezed *badly*. <br><br>What we care about is the health of the company later. JCP is struggling. Badly. So are some of the other middle-class consumer staples. I know you think that these brands will be here forever, but when the Affordable Healthcare Act expenses erode spending, coupled with more people on government assistance programs than there are productive workers, and credit being constricted, this is what the death spiral for these malls is. Sears is no different, Lampert didn’t do what everyone thought he would do with this. <br><br>*You’re confused when you mention AJs fund*. That is for grocery-anchored retail (aka *”broadline retial*”). No consumer discretionary staples. <br><br>These stores serve a sedentary population, who use their EBT cards for these foodstuffs and is not seen in most ways competing with Amazon. <br><br>So Jack, knowing what you know now, would you invest your life savings into this deal?  <br><br>Just a yes or no is required from your gut here. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Not to beat a dead horse but retail capacity that is excess in one location can not be loaded on a truck and taken to another area where it is needed.  <br><br>As far as low skilled workers vs high skilled workers, the worker who has skills that are in demand by the market is the one who has a job.  I have watched engineers with PHDs driving taxi cabs and swearing that they only had a high school education.  I have seen engineers with MS not be hired because the employer only needed someone with a BS and the employer knew that when times got better, the MS would move on. There are jobs available if someone is willing to develop the skills needed and move to where the jobs are.<br><br>That being said, the class of real estate that I see as being in danger of going dark before retail are office buildings.  There are several large complexes here in Dallas that are very dim or dark and Dallas is definitely not Detroit.  With today&#39;s technology, other than the ego, why do most companies need large or small offices in an office building?  All that is needed is a phone and internet connection.  For those times when a personal meeting is needed or video conferencing, then rent the time from a hot chair company that rent by the hour. <br><br>Banks also fall into that category.  I do virtually all of my bill paying on line and bank transactions at the ATM. <br><br>So I get back to my original question which is: With all of the negative doom and gloom and the sky is falling, what should I be looking for?        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>To answer your question about whether or not I would invest in this if I had the funds.  I come from this demographic and have lived long enough to have gone through several ups and downs in the economy.  Are changes coming, definitely. Will it happen in the next year or so, don&#39;t think so.  It is tempting to look at the broad brush predictions about over capacity and retail going dark without looking at where the over capacity is.  How much retail &#39;over&#39; capacity is in Detroit or Gary, IN or other places where whole industries have moved out?<br><br>Regarding low skill vs high skill.  I supported a wife and two sons on a basic skill I learned in high school.  This skill allowed me to eventually start my own company.  I finally went back to college to get my B.S. in Marketing (I have a B.S in BS). It only took me 34 years to complete, not because I needed it but because I wanted it.  My point is that having a skill that is needed in the market is the key, not that you have a PHD in Navajo basket weaving and then complain that you can not find a job.<br><br>If I had to make a choice between investing in real estate in Ardmore, OK with a 3.1% unemployment rate that is declining and a household income that is 140% of the national median income with the oil patch going like crazy or a small town in the mid-west where all of the citizens are on welfare and use their EBT cards to buy all of their needs, then I will chose Ardmore.        </p>

          Jack<br><br>First, I’ll respond, however, I’m not obligated to. You’ve been a member for a while, I like and respect you (no matter what you think of me…) so I’ll answer this. I know you’re active and I support the active people with a passion.  These take a long time to craft carefully and sometimes I have to have AJ review it so it doesn’t sound so terse and give other Intermediaries the bad impression. <br><br>My goal here is to make everyone *think*. That is why I crafted this response. There are some folks here reading this who have a few million in the bank and may do something with it that could get them wiped out. <br><br>*1. Regarding AJ’s Deal:* I appreciate what you are saying about AJs deal; however you’re talking about 2 different narrow niches here. <br><br>Comparing this to AJs fund which is really narrow is not what we’re doing here. But I have to say that AJ’s tenants for his deal are seen as being much stronger than most credits (aka “credit tenants”) on your deals rent roll because they are owned by a very big private equity firm that has a very strong balance sheet. <br><br>Also, since this idea has been conceived, larger private equity players have come in and have done something similar in this space. <br><br>And if the feedback from AJ’s pitch (soon to be released as a Continuing Ed) to a group of very, very wealthy family offices is any indication, it’s a winning idea. That is the smart money.  <br><br>(If people buy HUD housing because they want the stable monthly checks from the government, why should it be any different for EBT and food stamps?)<br><br>*1. Regarding your deal:* We’re talking about having Dandrew provide debt and equity to a developer who is looking to convert an old smaller, concert hall into a shopping area. To use this he is cross collateralizing a mall he is developing in Ardmore, OK that has some tenants who are getting hit. <br><br>These tenants, regardless of the micro, Ardmore-based unemployment rate are subjected to the same <br>market forces. JC Penney is not seen as a “credit tenant”. The middle class is getting squeezed more and more every day. <br><br>The American economy is *not* strong, no matter what anyone tells you on TV, and we’ve seen some colleagues recent get hurt in North Dakota in the oil business as well; its boom and bust and I think the fracking business is on its way out. Not now, but in 2 years it will be different. A lot of these deposits haven’t been as fruitful as once thought they were. But that is a different story altogether. <br><br>If your middle class in a job it’s downright awful; you’re losing money each year, there is no job security and that affects spending. It always has, and it always will. There may not be soup lines but the pain is probably even more acute today.  <br><br>If you own your own business, you are not subjected to the same wage compression, you’re future is seen as being more stable and you have more discretionary money to spend. <br><br>At the end of the day, what I’m telling you is that I’m not smarter than you or anyone else, just *much more experienced*. I get paid to look at these deals to insulate my investors and be a custodian for their money. They look to me to really dig in to see where the risks are. This deal is painted with more risk than what most capital providers would be comfortable with. I’m the jealous ex-boyfriend doing the best due diligence I can on these deals. That is why I manage so much. They know the last person anyone wants to question their due diligence is mine. Its why our staff and AJ has spent *2 years of his life in my office*, to learn this method of *thinking* like a jilted lover, metaphorically speaking. <br><br>And when AJ came in, he was the happy sap. Today he is just as happy, richer, but 100% less “sap”. Ask anyone who’s been with us for a while and they will tell you this. <br><br>*Honest financial research is a discipline. It requires us to not only understand the fundamentals, but to question the fundamentals. It requires us to look beyond what we would LIKE to see in the economy, and accept the reality of what is actually there.* That is how we structure our deals: *we simply attempt to structure the risk away from the deals* as we craft a solution to them. <br><br>To answer your question on what we have been working on in *retail* are “lifestyle” centers that have a higher end, clientele that have been booming for a while. For example one of these centers was a loan facing maturity default with leasees such as Williams Sonoma, Capitol Grill, a Talbots, Whole Foods and some others of equal caliber that I can’t remember off hand. This is based in CA. Regardless, if it were based in Dallas, it would still be attractive. <br><br>The fringe buyers on the lower end of the scale are facing extinction, hence I think that’s why you’ll see a lot of TGIFridays and Applebee’s start to get stressed. They will simply go to McDonalds, generally speaking. <br><br>*You need to learn to look at the numbers dispassionately.* We’re still in business and doing well because we considered ourselves to be more macro looking at these deals. Many people got into deals based on *emotion* and got killed. How do I know this? I raised $15mm around OFREEFund.com to manage this. <br><br>So at the end of the day, focus on defaulted note deals at a strong basis - that’s 60% of our business (and our colleagues too actually) and steer clear of these deals where there is more sizzle than steak. And you’ll get paid. <br><br>There are tons of these deals out there. But it requires everyone to be focused on what is going to close, not on what “should” close based on sentiment or emotion. <br><br>I could be wrong, but 12 year track record  on my own and a solid reputation as a risk manager tells me otherwise. <br><br>Still your pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Recently I&#39;ve been seeing deals come across my desk where the sellers want to sell entire pools of loan servicing. I have been wondering why and I received my answer today. I thought this might be of interest to the community.<br><br>I read a blog today and this was what was said...<br><br>Dodd-Frank Affects Lenders Who Service Scratch and Dent Loans...<br>Many mortgage lenders decide to service scratch and dent loans, defective loans and non-performing loans which cannot be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac due to some type of underwriting error.<br><br>Lenders Service these loans as opposed to selling them for a loss on the secondary market. Because of the sweeping regulatory changes, lenders now face a more complicated and expensive regulatory framework for servicing loans.<br><br>My question is this, wouldn&#39;t capital professionals and others like us be a better choice for selling these loans to than having the banks back against the wall in having to deal with these problematic loans?        </p>

          I know so little about the subject, Sal, that I don&#39;t know what to think. Is there any action that you/we can take to ascertain up front whether a particular judge will or will not give us super priority, or do we have to hang around in the case for months/years before we know whether we&#39;re going to fund or bail? Is there a specific court hearing on the subject of DIP?<br>        </p>

          I know Denton well, I lived there up to this year. It is a college town, home to University of North Texas. It is a huge student housing community. It&#39;s a nice community.        </p>
