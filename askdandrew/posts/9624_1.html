          May be weedy because I&#39;m actively in meetings this week - just left one 90 minute ago. Questions come up as I go along: Client name M.A. signs engagement letter. Our agreement is that I will help her raise capital on an asset by asset basis for two years. 1st use case is a mobile home park. Likely to need some pref equity (and maybe a bridge) to close. I reach out to my network - you, a second funding source + golf and cigar guys. <br><br>As we consider my golf and cigar guys, M.A. and I both want to make sure these guys are accredited and capable of sustaining a loss - verified by 2 yrs prior tax filings. Should the verification be part of the service we provide to M.A. - thus suggesting that we keep the records on file in our office - or should the client (M.A.) be pulling those two years of tax records - or should we both be doing this?         </p>

          Two years for a raise? No. 6 months x2. <br><br>What happens if NYC is nuked? Or LV? Or something happens where the markets freeze up? <br><br>Who&#39;s idea was 2 years? That is too long.         </p>

          This isn&#39;t about spending two years for a single raise. It would be making fundraising services available for two years at agreed upon fee schedule without having to renew the engagement letter. <br><br>Why would I not want to raise money - or attempt to raise money - for this company&#39;s deal flow for the next two years? They are closing 4-5 deals per year. To me, that represents 4-5 K-1 and fee opportunities per year. <br><br>I suppose I&#39;m not following.  <br><br>My question was about the compliance work, but I&#39;m happy to discover a second opportunity to excel. <br>        </p>

          We&#39;ve come to know you as a fund manager, but what kind of fund is the fund that you manage exactly?  Is it called an alternative investment fund or simply a real estate fund? Something else? How do we explain to more sophisticated Sponsors, the funding source that is backing us? <br><br>I listened to your recording this past weekend  - in it, you mentioned that you have an LPA with an insurance company, managed out of New York, that allows you to work in the $1mm - $10mm space at lower interest rates (6%). This would indicate that Dandrew partners is actively fundraising &amp; your partner in New York recently closed with a new LP - bringing us our newest product line. <br><br>The commercial lending aspect of my business (and other’s like mine) is really rooted in sourcing deal flow to keep your capital deployed and performing… Am I on track?         </p>

          Dave: <br><br>Its called a *discretionary real estate capital fund*. <br><br>And yes, you finally got it! We need the deal flow from you Intermediaries to keep the capital deployed and to show that one of our &quot;edges&quot; is we can generate deal sourcing (almost) on demand. <br><br>AJ is on vacation this week and he will be sending out an email for text alerts from NYC for all of our intermediaries to get our alerts. <br><br>I&#39;m so proud of you.

          Dave: <br><br>Again with the dissertation questions... <br><br>A share of any profits that the general partners of private equity and hedge funds receive as compensation, despite not contributing any initial funds.

          Hi Sal,<br><br>I&#39;m also licensed for annuities in multi-states.  Many of my clients will like better returns on commercial mortgages than annuities.  I will not like to service these loans, because my company is not set up that way.  <br>I would rather have your organization service them, and I can get investors involve with your in-house servicing program.  Like this, I can keep originating loans and focusing on new business.  Thank you, I greatly appreciate it.  <br><br>Regards,<br><br>Rigo        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;m a commercial mortgage broker in the SF Bay Area.  I&#39;ve been bringing in debt financing for a small commercial developer (2 partners) buying small distressed or undervalued properties for a quick turnaround (in less than 12 months).  Average purchase price is about $3 million, and average debt of $1.7 million per deal.  They bring their own equity investors  to the deals (primarily local commercial brokers) and have had problems with those investors.  Nothing major - but enough that the developers want to eliminate that stress from their lives.<br>Now they want me to find investors for them - the general equity required will range from $1 million to $1.7 million per deal.<br>I meet with them on Thursday morning to discuss it.  I&#39;m willing to take it on, but I don&#39;t know the standard compensation for an equity raise like this.  What is a reasonable amount to charge the developers in terms of points (percent of equity raised) and as a percentage ownership in each deal?  Or maybe there&#39;s another way to structure compensation - I&#39;m in the dark and need help with this.<br>Thank your for your thoughts.<br>Dennis        </p>

          Dennis<br><br>I apologize that I’m getting to this now as I have been traveling lots lately, expecially late in April. <br><br>I would tell them that this is a *very specialized structured product* and this is expensive, both for your fees and the cost of capital. <br><br>Start there. People who want equity facilities (“lines of equity”) will pay on a typical profit split promote and an IRR look back of around 10-12% depending on how much new and fresh equity they are bringing to the table. <br><br>If you don’t know what this means, this is what JV Equity vs Fund Structures is about in your Private Equiteer program. <br><br>Sal <br>        </p>

          Not really sure where to put this, but, Sal, you asked me to post a straw-man agenda for my &quot;Day with Sal&quot; in Vegas. I tried to steer clear of asking you to repeat content you&#39;ve already made available through your briefcase and the various online training you&#39;ve already produced. I focused on getting the most value working specifically on our business Core and around the margins of the products you&#39;ve already made (items I don&#39;t completely understand).

          Here&#39;s an addendum: as I move through the material you sent me in the briefcase, my questions are quickly evolving - literally by the hour in some cases. I&#39;ve put things on my agenda that you&#39;ve answered. Your course materials anticipate and, almost like whack-a-mole, knock my questions back into the holes they came from. <br><br>My intent for my DWS is this: like every ship that&#39;s ever launched, a bottle of champaign is broken over the bow before she is slid into the water. I want my day with Sal to be a final check over my systems and materials. At the end of our time together, I want you to help me break that bottle of champaign over the bow as we slide this new vessel into the water. The work I hope we do is a sanity and systems check by more experienced eyes to make sure that I heard, coupled with my previous experience, and have applied the material I am getting from your training. I want to make sure the thing I&#39;ve built is sea worthy. <br><br>An agenda item I&#39;d like to add to my DWS is this: if I knew what you know now, what questions SHOULD I be asking that I am not? <br><br>In addition to the basic discussion outline I posted above (meant to ensure we visit the entire foundation), and plowing through the briefcase at light speed, what &quot;wood&quot; do you recommend that I chop between now and our meeting?         </p>

          Sal - I know we&#39;re getting together next week, and I hope there is still time to share some agenda items. Most of what I posted earlier was about getting my company stuff in one sock. I&#39;ve been making progress on that front. It still needs a sanity check and the proverbial champaign breaking over the bow, but my interests are evolving. I&#39;d like to meet Corey, AJ, and other that I hope to have the privilege of working with. <br><br>I&#39;d like the inside skinny and to get - straight from the source - the information I need to make their jobs easier. It would be great to understand clearly how they define success - so I can make that happen for my part. <br><br>It would also be great to see examples of good deals in action - protecting the source, of course. I think this exposure will give me the insight I need to smooth out wrinkles in my affiliate business and plug it into Dandrew operations effectively.         </p>

          I should have typed &quot;intermediary business&quot; vs &quot;affiliate business.&quot; I come from and prefer high trust environments. New partnerships tend to lurch and bump like a train leaving the station until everyone gets in sync. I hope to minimize bumping with Dandrew. My goal is to clearly understand how you&#39;re defining success and to remove obstacles I may inadvertently bring to the table. <br><br>By way of example, I made it a policy to spend some time with my staffs in their environments. I&#39;d pitch in, listen, observe - as appropriate. I rarely made any substantive changes for the first four months after taking over a new office. This gave me a visceral understanding of what the people I relied on face, what they want, and how to make getting things done easy.         </p>

          Sal,<br>I had an idea for a JV arrangement tied into a consulting opportunity. I came up with this idea just a bit ago. I have currently 400 plus connections on LinkedIn and many are securities attorneys, attorneys that specialize in funds and the legal side, compliance, etc.<br><br>Since there can be significant legal costs associated with doing capital raises, I got to thinking. Why not JV with one of these attorneys, who will do the legal. I handle the capital raise and put all these services into a package, with one price tag and profits are spilt 50/50 after costs are recouped.<br><br>In your opinion is this a viable undertaking?        </p>

          I think that is a solid idea. Never tried that personally, but I think that is a strong thesis. <br><br>I don&#39;t think lawyers are able to bundle their services for a fee, but what I would do is to call them and tell them how you can do your real estate capital raising services. <br><br>Great idea. <br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have been watching the videos in the Fundraising Fundamentals Program. There is nowhere to leave comments, so I am doing it here.<br><br>I think that anyone who watches the videos cannot be anything less than excited. I think what is being taught opens the doors to so many opportunities to generate income.<br><br>This is not for the faint of heart and certainly not for anyone who does not really want to have their own Wall Street Firm, even if that firm is located outside Wall Street and not even in NYC, NY. As you and I both know, being Native New Yorkers as we are is that most investments banks are not located on Wall Street but up around 5th Avenue anyway. The firms on Wall Street are those trading houses that work the floor on the exchange.<br><br>I think that one thing people have to understand and realize is that money goes where it is respected most. What I mean by this is that those with discretionary capital will place monies with those that they trust to look out for their best interests and when you can help someone get their money working for them and generating returns, you are really looking out for their best interests.<br><br>My wife asked me what the difference between being in the banker program and the Private Equity Program with Dandrew is and I told her that I get to play in the same league as the biggest firms in our business and I explained to her that those who create funds, orchestrate the successful capital raise gets to experience perks such as riding in the back of cars and sitting at the front of planes but more important is that a successful deal creates additional opportunities and that our world and that of our family has just changed.<br><br>By the way Sal, it is 0215 am and I am up working. I do not sleep. I can sleep when I have a hundred million dollars in the bank. <br><br>My thoughts are in closing that people really have to know your here. They have to know what your doing and how what your doing can align with what they are doing or want to do. I am big on using LinkedIn. People want to do business with those who have a presence and can do things like we can do. Everyone who is important wants to be aligned with those who they view are just as important as they are or more important.<br>        </p>

          I am going to put this out for thought - and maybe to open a dialog about what a fund (or having the skill to craft a fund) could do if We get creative about harvesting value. I acknowledge that this is not even close to being in the current Dandrew wheelhouse, but I wouldn&#39;t be submitting this kind of thing to the deal desk. I only offer it here because Sal has made it clear that he is not trying to be our last stop. He is training us to be more. <br><br>In one hand, I met an investor / operator who is well heeled and interested in old mills in the South. His angle is tax credits, historical restorations, and community development. His last deal involved restoring an old mill and putting up 400 housing units around the mill. Don&#39;t ask me to explain the details of how his angle works because I haven&#39;t had that many dinners with him yet. <br><br>In the other hand, I have family connection to a small rural township in South Carolina that is sporting rich history, three mills, and a pristine lake. I&#39;m playing cupid in my free time - exploring ways to bring money into the town and possibly develop a small tourism attraction around that lake. <br><br>Pro&#39;s: the location is one of four communities in the country designated as a &quot;destination community&quot; in a livability assessment done by a &quot;conservation fund.&quot; State Highways was part of the discussion. I&#39;ve spoken with the current Mayor, the former Mayor, a PM responsible for one of the Mills, and have the wherewithal reach into a relevant Congressman&#39;s office. If someone can get a good enough story/ plan together, we have a better than average chance to juice the deal with some political interest and top cover. Local leadership is on board and already started training local townspeople in hospitality (the first class is next month). They&#39;ve gotten some small grants. They are putting in fiber optics infrastructure and fancy themselves serving business people working out of nearby cities as fully wired getaway. Down the river, a similar project appears to have been successful. They were on their way to executing their strategic plan in 2008, but things all fell apart when the economy tanked.<br><br>Cons: The town is dying. The local townspeople are few and unskilled. Any numbers produced by the town so far indicate that a project here would be a money suck. Without deliberate and intelligent action, this place is going to fall off the map. The town&#39;s strategic plan calls for a 1.5mm infusion in capital to develop a 7.6 acre tiny parcel of land near the lake. It&#39;s projected to return $130k in revenue to the town after year one. I have not been able to find an upside to investors worth talking about yet - but maybe I&#39;m not thinking far enough out of the box. Their strategic plan is on it&#39;s way to my office for review. I think the town is thinking too small. <br><br>It&#39;s an interesting story and one I think this country can benefit from our thinking through. I&#39;ve long said, since I wielded some amount of government authority myself - that our Nation&#39;s problems can&#39;t be solved by government and they won&#39;t be solved by big business. If they are going to be solved, they will be solved by small and mid-sized businesses that find ways to be profitable while creating value in our communities. <br><br>If anyone has any cool ideas or suggestions, I am both ears open. There is more than Dandrew money and wheelhouses following these forums. I know, because you guys are emailing me!        </p>

          A fundamental question for the team: licensing and other legal hurdles: all three financing profit centers seems pretty straight forward on the surface. The training covers the field well and it seems that interests are aligned. Moving forward, I hope to make most efficient use of my legal counsel&#39;s time (and my resources). <br>Are there licensing or other legal hurdles I should look into? <br>Along the same lines, I noticed a recommendation to structure as a Nevada LLC. Why should we be looking in that direction? <br>I assume that I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve got eight days to get this set up, and. I&#39;d rather not run into speed bumps just prior to an event I&#39;ll be attending later this month.          </p>

          Sal - It&#39;s not your event. It&#39;s an event I&#39;d like to use as a marketing opportunity. <br><br>The answer will help with domain and entity name selection, help (but not prevent) me from embarrassing myself on stage, and hopefully prevent a re-do of our credibility kit in February. Beginning on the 22nd, I expect to 1. Have nice lunches and dinners with deal makers, owners, and other lenders 2. Be asked to speak for a few minutes in front of the group about what I am doing. I&#39;d like to include this in my talking points and to deliver those points with enough authority to add a few pounds to my auto-responders.  <br><br>Back room stuff: In order to match a domain name with the name of an entity, we&#39;d like to make sure the entity name is available in the state we set it up. Not having an answer means matching the Nevada database, the Delaware database (where I&#39;ve formed previous entities), and the Maryland database (the state our lawyer defaults to) with the domain registrar. They say we can pay three $75 name reservations (not going to happen) while we decide which state we&#39;re using, or it could mean filing a DBA later. I&#39;m not thrilled about either option. An answer now simplifies things. <br><br>License or other legal hurdles: Someone from the room I am talking to is bound to ask if we need a series seven, a lending license, or something similar in order to structure a fund or lend. I&#39;d prefer to have the answer ahead of time. I&#39;d also like to avoid finding out after they hand us a deal that we need to scramble for a license or punt. Moves like those are reputation killers. <br><br>Once we hit &quot;go&quot; and I get on that plane, I want to know that we&#39;ve done all we need to do - and that there are no legal obstacles we haven&#39;t addressed standing between that prospect and a closed deal. <br><br>My frame of reference: Reg D syndications are full of little rules that need to be followed. Our SEC attorney is forever throwing wet blankets on my talking points, making sure my numbers are right, making sure I&#39;ve established my relationships properly, etc. I have not spoken to him about this yet, but his voice is always in my head. <br><br>I suppose we could pass on using this opportunity to market, but since I&#39;ll be standing on front of a room full of people who will either be funding deals or need money for their deals in less than two weeks, I thought it would be nice to get the ball rolling.        </p>

          Ah. I see. <br><br>tell me how you&#39;re be pitching yourself and what you will be saying. That is what I need to see. Then I can shape a good response for you around that. <br><br>Regarding Reg D, I&#39;m not sure that is something of practical significance. I need to know who you will be talking to, and what your objectives are. <br><br>I&#39;m asking this as I&#39;ve been asked this many times in the past and it sort of nips it in the bud when I just craft a pitch. I see you are a Private Equiteer so if you were just a Banker, I could have answered this already. <br><br>Sal<br><br>        </p>

          I appreciate that you seem to want to help me with my presentation, but that wasn&#39;t the purpose of my question. That said, I&#39;d be a fool to turn down a set of expert eyes on it though, so here&#39;s the skinny:<br><br>&quot;Pitching&quot; is a little strong. I&#39;m attending on a $5k scholarship - something I was awarded due to my status as a military Veteran (http://veterans-scholarship.com/). It&#39;s a several day multi-family commercial real estate course. <br><br>I&#39;m familiar with this course, the instructors, and the makeup of the audience. I started with this group back in 2005 or so - went through their gold coaching program, etc. I&#39;ve also purchased property with some of these people, put some of my own money into their deals as an LP, and placed some of their funds into multi-family investments I trusted. I am known in these circles. I expect that there is a higher than average chance that I&#39;ll be targeted to say a few words. I want to be ready. <br><br>This audience is made up of students with various levels of experience, hard money lenders, and sponsors looking to hone their skills. I&#39;ve even run into local bankers from time to time. This course is a little advanced for beginners. <br><br>My objective for next week is to stuff my auto-responder with as many contacts as I can carry. Since I do most everything electronically, I can carry a lot. <br><br>My &quot;pitch,&quot; (open to criticism) is very simple: I am an investor like many in the room. I&#39;m also an Investment Officer for MLC Capital Partners. We&#39;re a buyer of some things and a financier of many. If you know someone who is in need of bridge loan products between $2M and $30M or would just like to know more about the types of financing we offer, text your name and email address to... I will respond within 24 hours.&quot; <br><br>My auto-responder is nearly configured for this event. My Web site is up (http://MLCCapitalPartners.com). My credibility kit is being crafted &amp; should be done in time. I have a nice catchers mitt set up to catch and follow up with whatever shakes out. I just wish I had the time to grab that LinkedIn guide you publish so I could set that up correctly before i go. I heard in one of your continuing ed&#39;s how to get that, so hopefully Monday...<br><br>I couldn&#39;t wait on the LLC. I set it up in Delaware. It&#39;s easy. I&#39;m familiar with Delaware. They&#39;re fast, business friendly, and they don&#39;t hit me with the filing fees that Nevada now does. Besides, the girl I asked to do this for me lives and works in Delaware. No brainer. <br><br>I also started someone on the licensing and other legal hurdles search. If you can shortcut that for me, it&#39;ll help. I want to know if I&#39;ll need something like a series seven, or if I have to do something like establish and document pre-existing relationships (as I do with Reg D syndications of mom and pop money). Also... are there any circumstance where I may have to foreign file in some other state (either investor state or property state) as I continue with DandrewPartners?         </p>

          I get it. now. However, I don&#39;t know if this is the appropriate setting to finding meaningful sponsors. These are mostly seminar grads who want to learn the business but not necessarily *actually do the business*. You&#39;re going to attract good attention. But perhaps not the quality attention that AJ gets when we send him out to these conferences. <br><br>(We&#39;ll be releasing some footage of me pitching at a Grownup conference to all Private Equiteers later this week so keep you eyes on your email.)<br><br>Most Intermediaries go to the what we call the &quot;Grownup Conferences&quot; that the playmakers go to. <br><br>So as far as licensing, I will tell you that I&#39;m not an attorney nor am I qualified to render legal advice. So what that said, we have paid intermediaries who have closed deals as 1099 consultants. <br><br>As far as Delaware, I think there are tax consequences there too and not as strong anonymity as Nevada LLCs. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I agree with your assessment of quality of attention. It may not be hitting the &quot;sweet spot.&quot; The immediate value that this brings me (and by extension, to you) is that it forces me to get my proverbial act together. I&#39;m using it as a dry run, so to speak, but treating it as if...<br><br>Results so far: My Web site is running. Email is established. LLC is set up. Discussions with lawyers are under way. My credibility kit is being designed. A logo is being designed separately. I&#39;m setting up my auto-responder today. I&#39;ve distilled my elevator speech. My suits are pressed. My shoes are shined. My 800 number is set up... etc. <br><br>An analogy: Sign up to run a 10K and see what it does for your body. As one who swam 8 miles, biked 500, (etc) - (not at the same time); I can say that a 10K run isn&#39;t all that impressive by itself. I do 10k&#39;s as daily workouts. But if you need to get going, knowing that an event like this is in front of you and on the calendar is excellent. <br><br>This content in this program is very close to what you teach. It covers market selection, asset valuation (using the NOI method), take down, managing property management, positioning for sale, and more. It goes into considerably more depth on the multi-family asset class - as this course was designed for operators, sponsors, syndicators, etc. There is a lot on numbers and market analysis. <br><br>It&#39;s a course I don&#39;t mind repeating 8 years later. After having evolved my business model to include Dandrew financial products, I am going back with something of value to offer. <br><br>What you say about Delaware vs Nevada anonymity is exactly what I thought. I believe that was the way entity formation used to be. I was told this week, however, that things have changed in Nevada - both in terms of filing fees and in anonymity. Delaware does not require me to list my company officers in the operating agreement, for example. Nevada does. I&#39;m not a lawyer either. I&#39;ve just been listening to them for the last few days - for what that&#39;s worth. <br><br>Licensing is more on my radar as it pertains to the PLN (part of our credibility kit that I assume was written or reviewed by you) and as it pertains to the Capital Formation Series. Collection of individual investors and/or securitizing into funds seems to me would have SEC interest. This issue won&#39;t have much impact on my trip this week, but I will likely be circling back around with you once I get back. <br><br>I look forward to seeing the footage you mention above. Thank you for your reply.         </p>

          As it relates to the Banker and Arbitrage work you&#39;ll be doing at this event, licensing isn&#39;t an issue, generally speaking. You will probably not get even one deal from that room as they aren&#39;t qualified. This may not be what you want to hear, but I&#39;d just rather tell you to manage your expectations. Lindhal is a great guy and great instructor, but not the place I would go hunting for deals. <br><br>The PLN and when you start *actively* soliciting money that is when the conversation will change. <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal - money finds me. A few months ago, I raised and placed about half a mil and I sincerely didn&#39;t try. I was just helping a friend. We accomplished our goal with an attorneys help via a PPM, subscription, and operating agreements. We&#39;ll see value created for everyone involved. Success breeds more success. <br><br>It doesn&#39;t have to be right away, but I would like to know how to start that conversation with you in the not too distant future. People with mom and pop money call me. I find deals.  <br><br>I&#39;d like to know what my options are - if any.         </p>

          I put it into syndication that was used to acquire - and is still being used to reposition - a 140 unit garden style multi-family apartment in a TIF zone in Fort Worth. The pool was fixed, the fences mended, new signage, etc... the usual. The bigger challenge has been fixing the tenant base. Stricter leasing parameters, partnerships w local resources, raising rents to market levels, and non-negotiable rent collection procedures have been making the difference in this regard. <br><br>It&#39;s not performing yet, but the NOI is trending in the right direction. We had to do an internal raise for cash flow purposes to satisfy a Fannie Mae 4505 requirement placed by Arbor, but that&#39;s behind us now and things are looking up. <br><br>I&#39;ve purchased as an LP in this general area before, have established some good local relationships, and understand (from experience) the value of good sponsor / operator selection. <br><br>This operator has many strengths, but should have been vetted a little deeper.  They would have benefitted from some shoring up on the syndication and investor management side. This is one aspect of your program I find appealing. I&#39;ve had to be more involved as an LP than I would have liked, but I have a responsibility to take care of the folks who trust me. My reputation is a resource I don&#39;t want to have to fix. <br><br>I&#39;d rather not disclose the operator (s) in this venue.         </p>

          David<br><br>Nice! You’re the kind of people I like working with and keep me doing what I do for Dandrew Media. Great story! <br><br>But being cynical at best and paranoid at worst, my questions are getting the better of me. <br><br>How long has this been going on for? The Bad Operator story is common. “I don’t know how this guy Bad Operator keeps getting rehired”, is the punchline in the industry lately… Don’t be afraid to put the proverbial gun to his head to make him go away via exercising the bad boy clauses. (You do have these clauses, right?!)<br> <br>*Sal’s Rule: Good operators make bad deals great, bad operators make good deals bad.*<br><br>Stick with us as the Private Equiteer and you’ll have enough knowledge to not have to worry about losing your reputational capital. Stay cynical. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS Are you using a lock box to collect rents? You should be… If you’re on an AskDandrew call, remind me to tell you about the “lie detector” line that I used to scare a PM away. <br><br>PPS You should be going to Grownup Conferences with this experience. Why you’re going to a seminar with newbies I don’t know but you must see value there. <br>        </p>

          Day 1 results: 15 contacts made - two strong operator teams, and a couple handfuls of tire kickers and wanna bees. <br><br>First operator team: husband and wife company w 1,000+ units actively buying now and going over term sheets w other hard money lenders as I type this. Their issue is growth and bandwidth. They need a cash infusion to keep their acquisition pace. I did not dig too deeply into their qualifications, but they had duties segmented out well, have partners with SME on their team, and present as pretty well organized. The conversation is started w them, but it will take a little while to cultivate the relationship. They are already working closely with another hard money lender to get deals done. The specific deal we discussed briefly today has two term sheets from hard money lenders already on it. <br><br>Second operator team: Handed me an deal in writing that they are looking for equity to support. 224 unit in N Houston. Recently rehabbed. $7.6M purchase price. 1st position loan is occupied. They are looking for private equity or hard money to get the deal closed. Business partner is sending me 5 data points. The deal is yellow until then. I expect it to fall out, but it gives us a chance to talk and me a chance to meet the partners. <br><br>The second operator also opened a discussion about a hotel being flagged now ($80M purchase) - reportedly in progress now and looking for a large lender to take out several smaller lenders. The guy asking me to consider this is a commercial broker, but he is principal in this transaction. His personal portfolio is reportedly at around $100M and I presume he will be willing to cross collateralize. <br><br>I have nothing concrete and nothing to submit to the deal desk that I would risk my reputation capital on, but since you asked me about value, these are what I consider seeds. Deal makers like these aren&#39;t growing moss on their back sides. They are turning deals several times per year, know other legitimate deal makers who are shaking trees, and my thesis is they are bound to run into situations where our products can help. Please correct me if I&#39;m off target. <br><br>These guys are all on my drip campaign and will be segmented as I get the sequence set up. Doing this all on the fly from my iPhone at the conference and my laptop in a hotel room - and my credibility kit is still being printed at FEDEX Kinkos at the moment, but I believe it&#39;s a start.        </p>

          &gt; I posted my reply in another thread by accident from my iPhone. Here it is again in context. &lt;<br><br>Sal – thanks for your reply. I feel pretty confident about the material Dandrew created. Strong value add. <br>It’s been going on since July. I think 12-18 months is a fair timeframe to give an operator to turn around a repositioning. We’re about 2k per door into our CAPEX plan. I expect this one will take us to $5k per door by the time it’s done. Big changes. Positive perception improvements so far. NOI is steadily increasing. Despite some of my colleagues unrest, I’m not uncomfortable yet. <br>As a condition of our investment, we get direct ‘live’ access into Buildium – the software used by our property management team. I can see everything to the work order level. The math works out. <br><br>This is a high trust environment. The operator is strong – but is dealing with unexpected medical challenges. <br><br>I have not considered a lock box, but I would have nothing bad to say about that idea. I’m betting that it’s effective. I don’t presume to know the property management side better than our property manager in place – but I’ve seen some hokus pocus and are watching closely for anomalies. We’re asking questions when appropriate. They’ve been transparent. <br><br>I look forward to the “lie detector” story. <br><br>Value so far: connected with a set of operators who are currently looking for hard money. They have about 1000 units behind them and are collecting term sheets. I have a hard money guy they are working closely with now, but I expect after this relationship matures a little, they’ll be giving me a call. I am farming while getting up to speed with Dandrew.        </p>

          To my disappointment, after asking for five data points - or in the case of capital formation cases, their deal book and bios - information that trickled in was incomplete ad/or weak. Many of these leads went dark. Poof! Smoked. No more responses. <br><br>Another fund guy I met cautioned me about them immediately following the trip. He suggested that anyone who hands me a deal in an open forum looking for equity - or tries to get me to fill out an accredited investor form on the first meeting - probably isn&#39;t someone I want to be too close to. <br><br>In retrospect, this vanishing act is simply proof that we&#39;re on the right track. It&#39;s much better to vanquish the phantoms than waste time chasing them. <br><br>Next.        </p>

          I should summarize: This event yielded 41 contacts added to our auto responder. In addition to the potential deals I listed above (which have been trimmed down to zippy through continued dialog), I was given three referrals (not related to the event), and will continue to cultivate relationships with three seemingly strong operators (point of fact: two operators, and one fund manager who claims to be vetting me to help him deploy capital for his fund). <br><br>I believe that most of the 41 contacts in our auto responder sequence will not be productive business catalysts themselves. I do think they add value from the perspective that:<br><br>1. We can use them to hone our messaging and surveys<br>2. We can get our follow up systems into shape without risking making all of our inevitable mistakes in front of high value clients <br>3. We&#39;ve increased our potential for referrals<br>4. These people may become value added clients as our portfolio of services expands. For example, We may be able to help them down the road through hard money brokering once those relationships are forged. <br><br>And that is how we make lemonade.         </p>

          I would agree. I think it was the nature of the event... It was a guru meeting, albeit it probably had some folk there who were qualified, but I&#39;m wondering any FMs would go to this event in the first place. <br><br>Talk is cheap.<br><br>Cynical at best, paranoid at worst.         </p>

          Hello, in the second video of Week 2, it references a workbook. The only workbook I see in the Resources File is the Private Banking Client Questionaire, which does not correlate with the page numbers referenced in the video. Where can I access the workbook for Fundraising Fundamentals? Thanks!        </p>

          Hi Sal...I&#39;m going to be completing the client workbook and pitchbook for a new funding deal opportunity. This will be my first submission so I just want to make sure I complete/submit the correct docs. Would I complete the client workbook first and use that to complete the ptichbook draft? And then I would submit the completed workbook and pitchbook using the pitchbook critique certificate,right? Thx!        </p>

          Good Afternoon Sal<br><br>July 10, 2013 the SEC announced new 506D regulation relaxations. It will be a couple of months before we know the final rule and the IRS form changes, etc., but I would like to start planning now on how we take advantage and what your thoughts/opinion on the matter is.  I notice that similar queries have been posted to other of the Community Groups, however I would like to know specifically your counsel on advanced planning to be ready to rock and roll when the final rule is issued and effective, as well as which products you have/offer that will benefit and/or be affected by this change.<br><br>Please opine on the matter.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>KD        </p>

          Are the &quot;Fundraising Fundamentals&quot; and the &quot;Capital Syndicator&quot;  programs the same, different, or criss-cross products? (Criss-cross meaning they touch on some similar things, but have parts that are exclusive to one or the other)        </p>

          *Capital Syndication* gives you the in-depth (that&#39;s an understatement) of the mechanics of doing a Syndication where the *Fundraising Fundamentals* will show you how to do your pitch books and marketing materials. <br><br>Sal        </p>
