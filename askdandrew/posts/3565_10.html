          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on the medical project I am doing the capital raise for, it is really getting exciting and it really has taught me a lot.<br><br>We met with the owner of the subject acquisition property and we presented our offer of seller financing, ten years, 10% simple interest with one payment per year of $50,000.00 plus the interest.<br><br>He asked what we are going to do with the property and my wife said we need you to sign a confidentiality agreement first and he signed it. He is a retired medical doctor, so we did not want to lift our skirt first.<br><br>He came back with the following. He said that he likes the project a lot. He said why don&#39;t I give the property to you, since I own it free and clear and I have no real use for it and to get a buyer outside of us would take awhile.<br><br>He proposed that in exchange for the property, he gets a 15% equity stake in the entire project. He said he will make more money over the long term than selling the property outright and from a tax standpoint, this makes sense.<br><br>I will keep you posted as we go on.        </p>

          I&#39;m boosting my marketing by offering a 100% financing product to &quot;professional&quot; commercial real estate clients of real estate attorneys.  The offering will consist of part debt (whether it&#39;s existing or fresh)  and part equity (whether it&#39;s through capital raise or Dandrew).  Basically get one or the other from Dandrew - debt or equity that is- and get the remainder through a raise...but I had to sweeten the deal this way so I&#39;ll have the &quot;he who hold the gold makes the rules&quot; type leverage....basically this offer is to make up for my light experience but heavy intellectual capital.<br><br>-Hurol        </p>

          Huron,<br>Why would you offer 100% financing? Where is their skin in the game? being experienced is never going to take the place of having skin in the game.<br><br>Also are you going to amortize the loan over a long term with a balloon payment due in a shorter period of time? also if your going to do a capital raise, how will you structure the deal? what&#39;s in it for the equity investors?<br><br>How long are you going to keep the investors money tied up and how are you going to get it back to them? what if the investors want preferred equity? what if you need to do a capital call and the investors say no. What if the deal goes South, how will everyone be protected. Is all this capital going to over leverage the deal?<br><br>The risk you take is that a funder that will be in first position will ask where is the sponsor-operators equity going to come from? a lender may say that if the sponsor-operator uses funds from a capital raise, that those monies are not equity from their own resources.<br><br>If I were structuring this, I would do a complete capital raise for the entire investment and create a joint venture structure where the equity investors get their money back plus a negotiated % of profits or ROI and the principal sponsor-operator gets the income plus tax benefits.<br><br>        </p>

          Hurol<br><br>I&#39;m not sure I understand why you need to know terms of something that the attorneys do, not you. Actually, I don&#39;t want you anywhere near that. <br><br>So, tell me what you need to do. Are you putting together docs, Hurol?

          To the above intermediary.  I agree with what your saying.  If I&#39;m not mistaken having debt along with equity doesn&#39;t stop the equity holder from enacting remedies for non-performance as well as rewarding the sponsor for exceptional performance; there will be hurdles which have to be met.  Like Sal said this is knowledge of the lawyers, so they will be more versed in protecting the equity and the project.<br><br>For Sal, I guess at times I get stuck in analysis paralysis.  Ever since I heard you use the term &quot;Structure away the risk&quot;,  it is something that I have tattooed in the way I think.  And no, I&#39;m not putting together docs or papering deals; I&#39;m just hashing out talking point - sort of like and LOI.  Something like a verbal agreement before I bring it to you guys; basically setting expectations...(is this something you could help me with)?        </p>

          That is fine. You need to have these discussions *before* you speak to the attorneys. Otherwise they will charge you for “discovery”. Meaning, you’re paying to be the R&amp;D department on your own deal! <br><br>Structure the verbal agreement, place it here, and I’ll make changes as needed. <br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          Hurol,<br>I like the concept of offering 100% financing, not too many are doing this today. Let&#39;s look at the capital raise for a moment. Your asking investors to place funds in the deal and yes I agree, with the right docs drafted by the right attorneys, the investors can be protected and at the end of the day, that&#39;s where you need to place your concern.<br><br>Now if I&#39;m an investor and your pitching me on this deal, the first thing I&#39;m going to ask is how much skin in the game are the sponsor operators putting in. Why am I asking this? Two reasons.<br><br>1) Because I&#39;m looking to limit my exposure 2) I&#39;m looking for a reason (s) to say no. I&#39;m looking at the risks. Investors are always looking at the risks first, the rewards second because just one risk proving out can dilute my entire investment.<br><br>Next, I&#39;m going to ask, what happens if the sponsor operator causes the property to end up in foreclosure, am I going to have to get into a capital call just to save the property from foreclosure and protect my interest.<br><br>Next concern is how am I going to feel about sharing the stage with a lender? In a foreclosure action, most lenders will escalate the interest on the loan to the highest rate allowed by law, so if the loan starts out at 10% and the need to escalate comes about and the maximum in your state is 21%, were all in trouble. The lender isn&#39;t going to care about the investors.<br><br>Next I&#39;m going to focus upon you. Your setting up all of this. What experience do you have in this? do you understand what fiduciary duty really entails, how are you being compensated. You mentioned the concept of who has the gold calls the shots, well unfortunately, its the investors with the gold, so they will probably call the shots.<br><br>Like I said, I like it however, I would structure this as a joint venture, saying to the sponsor operator, you line up the funding first and my fund will invest the remainder. Your fund will be one you create and manage.<br><br>I know I sound like a james downer, I&#39;ve learned to think like this because this is how Sal has conditioned me to think.        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I just received an email from a private lender I know, has been in the business for a long time and is quite diligent about his work.  I wanted to share with you his lesson learned and to any others here that lend their own money.<br><br>&quot;A scary thing happened to me 8 months ago.<br>Lent $2.2mil on 2 apartment buildings, at 60% LTV, 11%, 2 points, 1 year, 3 mo prepaid interest.  A great loan, I thought.<br>After 3 months were up, interest payments did not come in.<br>Contacted the borrower, no response.<br>Went to the building, searched for manager.  <br>The manager told me these were fraudulently obtained loans.<br>WOW, I could feel the cold sweat on the back of my neck.<br>The real owner filed a police report.  Detectives interviewed me.<br>I kept thinking, &quot;what about my 2.2mil&quot;?<br>Contacted the title insurance company at once.<br>Took them 5 months to investigate.<br>It was scary, even I knew all along that I had title insurance.<br>Finally, last week, I got paid off by the title company, a great sigh of relief.<br>Got my own money back, but it certainly felt like wining the lotto.<br>I hear fraudulently obtained loans are plenty out there.   Watch out.  Especially if you are lending on a free and clear property.<br>Double check everything, I had, but I still fell victim.<br>There are gangs out there, searching for free/clear props.  Forging all owners&#39; info, id, and they are very good at it.<br>Signatures match, ids match, title company is fooled, etc etc.&quot;<br><br>Chris<br>        </p>

          Deric<br><br>*Great question.*<br><br>I would say that the honest answer is that we should be placing some of these closed deals (either with Dandrew Intermediaries or without Dandrew Intermediaries) somewhere in a members section for case studies for members to reference. <br><br>This way, these can be referenced for our Intermediaries. <br><br>In the meantime, tell him the average trades are 5mm in value, nationwide from smaller regionals looking to move balance sheet. <br><br>Gordon and I will put our heads together. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have been working for about a month now with a very experienced buying entity out of Newport Beach, California that has been buying seconds from banks for about seven years now. I think I mentioned them in another post.<br><br>I was thinking about presenting the idea of a credit facility to them through Dandrew. Would this be of interest to Dandrew? they want to do business by selling to us the seconds they choose to sell each month. <br><br>I&#39;m thinking a credit facility would be of great interest to them.        </p>

          James<br><br>Not for seconds. No. Nobody wants to provide debt (or equity) in this space as they are too small (in aggregate volume size) and remedying these can be expensive. <br><br>The collateral is dubious too. These are more like buying credit card paper and if they have been worked over before, chances are the buyer isn&#39;t going to pay. So what you&#39;re getting essentially has been picked through before by larger players. <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br>This gives me a idea. This idea could be a profit center in itself. The wheels are turning. Let me put this out there, please give me your thoughts.<br><br>How about creating a credit facility program/product available to those loan pool and bulk asset/bulk REO traders who are experienced, where they have two options. Option 1) Buy and hold for their own portfolio and pay Dandrew a predetermined monthly payment on each note on the credit line,  but they have to buy in bulk, so in essence, if they used their line to buy 50 notes, even though they are buying in bulk, they are paying on a per note basis. Option 2) Dandrew makes a equity investment and  I&#39;m taking this idea from the 40K Flips webinar, they either pay a Dandrew 15% profit or 12% per month until they retire the notes.<br><br>The risk is that they won&#39;t repay Dandrew because a note or notes go bad, so Dandrew files a UCC-1 and has a interest in each note or pool of notes or property, this way if it goes bad, Dandrew can recover the assets and facilitate a sale, thus recovering their monies.<br><br>This is Equity Sharing on steroids.         </p>

          James<br><br>You&#39;ve come a long way since before you became a Private Equiteer. Now you&#39;re thinking about what can go wrong and how to *structure the risk* away from your investors.

          I have a multifamily portfolio deal in Dallas -Houston, TX, that pass all our Pre-qualification questions (e.g. skin in the game, NOI can service the debt, 91%  occupancy, sponsor experience, etc.), but the loan amount required is $314,000,000. Since the loan amount is huge, I have advised the sponsor to try breaking down the portfolio in groups of buildings, so there would be several loans.  To further assist the sponsor, I need to know:<br>1.  What would be the max loan amount Dandrew would provide? This would help us grouping the assets, to fit Dandrew’s criteria).<br>2. Is Dandrew-Sal interested in a JV? <br>Thank you<br>        </p>

          Fulga:<br><br>We need to clarify a few things: <br><br>1.  That pass all *our* Pre-qualification.<br>Who is “our”? Fulga’s or Dandrew’s pre-qualifications? I’m only interested in the 5 Data Points for each asset at first. Nothing more. <br><br>2.  What is his experience managing this asset class? Did you ask for a Deal Sheet from him? <br><br>3.  Where are these assets coming from? Are you direct to the seller, who I imagine should be a lender or a large REIT? <br><br>4.  How long have they been looking for capital for this deal? <br><br>5.  Do you have – on an Excel spreadsheet – the assets that are included into this big trade? <br><br>If the numbers and experience add up, anything is possible. Right now these larger deals don’t usually flow downstream to the students as they are picked up by larger firms who have a lower cost of capital. Which makes me wonder about why they are coming to you. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Wow, that is a hefty number, what I am wondering is after several firms co fund this thing, will there be any meat left on the bone and just how much the monthly debt service payments are going to be at that price.<br><br>Fulga I would pay real close attention to the sources and uses statements, do they align with the story of the deal? Also let me tell you about how multi family works in Dallas.<br><br>You have South Dallas, North Dallas, Dallas, Uptown Dallas, and Oak Lawn. Dallas is comprised of 22 independent cities within Dallas County and each is a market of their own, with market conditions that all differ.<br><br>The areas I mentioned above are where all the multi family properties are in The city of Dallas.<br><br>South Dallas is an area that is not highly desirable based upon the market. Rents are somewhere around section 8 levels and can drop to a low of $300.00. This area is a war zone on steroids and there is at this time, zero upside to owning there. No one is coming in and investing any new money into infrastructure.<br><br>The other areas are more desirable and some properties can command rents of $2000.00 plus per month. My guess is that the collateral for this loan is going to have to be somewhere between $800 and $1200 per month or better to make debt stack payments.<br><br>The thing that makes Dallas attractive for the non-wealthy is that Texas in itself as well as Dallas and Houston us that us what us called debtors heaven. This means that those who have screwed up financially can move here and literally start over.<br><br>You can buy a car with no credit to severely damaged credit, can lease purchase a home even if you&#39;ve never paid a bill a day in your life for about $750.00 up front.<br><br>No one cares about people&#39;s pasts it seems. Very bad business practices.        </p>

          Sal, I am happy to find out that we can go so high in loan value with you, so I will get the answers to your questions. Regarding why somebody would come to Fulga with such a huge project, my answer is: Maybe I am doing something right. <br><br>I have also a request for a $1.7 Billion loan, where a group of investors would purchase a chain of high rated restaurants across US; I did not believe it first, so I requested all kind of documents, and I’ve received all the proof needed that they were serious about it (hundreds of legal pages). I’ve spent hours over the phone with the main sponsor to find out details about the deal, and we even talked about structuring scenarios. <br> <br>…so YES Sal, we are getting loans requests for huge amount of money, but I did not take them seriously, until now. <br>I have also on my desk loans requests for more than $50 mill each: 9 JVs, 8 development projects, and 2 multifamily purchases in London. <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have been working with a young man who is getting his MBA from Souther Methodist University. He is starting in the business and I&#39;m teaching him about loan pools and bulk assets.<br><br>He echoed your thoughts but took it a bit further. He suggested doing a call with the whole loan trader at this Hedge Fund and ask for a tape of what they have available. Upon securing this, let him model it against Dandrew&#39;s spreadsheet to ensure we have all the key data needed.<br><br>He made a very good point when he just saw your talk us cheap comment. His point is that if this really is an active Hedge Fund trading in these assets, they will understand what a fund like Dandrew will want to see. They won&#39;t be playing games with us.<br><br>Once everything we need is secured, submit it to you for purchase. Once submitted, then work to setup a conduit type relationship where they will give us first right of refusal on all subsequent deals and push to create a flow basis.<br><br>He also suggested saying to them, if your turning product every 60 days because your creating a huge tape, why not just break it in half and trade every 30 days and keep your funds investors monies working every 30 instead if every 60.        </p>

          James<br><br>Exactly. This is called a “bulk flow basis”. He is absolutely right. Have him call the funds to see if they want to “clear balance sheet” or at least having us “hang a number” on what they have. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Never at par and certainly not at par plus. That&#39;s like buying a slightly used Mercedes that you really want and paying new car prices. Anyone reading this, never, never, never pay retail, you can&#39;t make money that way and neither can your capital provider.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to pass this on for the benefit of those who are new and trying to navigate through the Bulk asset and Loan Pool segment of the business and may not be able to submit those types if deals to Dandrew.<br><br>I had a broker tell me today that he gets five points on every deal he does. I said that&#39;s fine, who&#39;s paying you that and where do I sign up at. He grew silent for a moment and said what does that mean.<br><br>I said let&#39;s rephrase that, five points that&#39;s fine, who&#39;s paying you. He said oh, well you are and I said nah, do to think so, he said isn&#39;t that customary?<br><br>Ok, look at his reply again? Clearly he bought some course written by some idiot. He didn&#39;t even know the game he is trying to play in. Don&#39;t let this happen to you.<br><br>When Sal says we will meet all types in this business, mainly those who are clueless, he is not kidding. So with that said, save yourself a lot of heart ache moving forward.<br><br>Someone says POF and LOI to see the deal, best reply is Proof of being a fool and Letter of intent? Not happening. Someone says  sign my NCND, run the other way.<br><br>Someone says sign my NDA, realize your probably dealing with a direct source and look to leverage your intellectual capital into a deal.<br><br>If someone says I&#39;m direct to the seller, ask this question...If I get on the phone with the seller are they going to tell me the same thing?<br><br>These are just a few things I&#39;ve come to learn a long time ago.        </p>

          Dexter, years ago when I started in the business I was brokering notes. Back then the in thing was trading individual notes. Pools were for the big boys, I.e selling entity to the bigger Wall Street type buyers with deep pockets who understood the matrix on pools.<br><br>I often worked with builders, mainly the smaller guys who did not always have the liquidity needed to secure development financing. Liquidity is a banking term that means having cash reserves on hand.<br><br>How I structured deals was as follows. I setup a relationship with note buyers ahead of time. This was easy because I was in their eyes a shop that would always have product available. I was going to bring about opportunities for them to make money, I wasn&#39;t a once in awhile deal source. <br><br>In the loan pool business and note business today, this is referred to as flow basis. This is what everyone wants. Once and dones are great but flow is where it is at.<br><br>Builders were easy to get on board because what I was doing was increasing their market because they would simply advertise, &quot;We offer Builder financing&quot;. This gave the builder a whole new market niche, because not many were offering this and it bought people in on Saturdays on a regular basis.<br><br>The deals were structured as follows. 65/20/15. This meant Builder would create a first lien mortgage for 65%, a second mortgage for 20% and buyer had to come to the table with 15% down. <br><br>The note buyer would run credit, qualify the deal and say yes or no. If it was a go, the title agent would create the docs and setup and administer the closing. The actual down was 10% but we added back in the anticipated 5% discount the builder would have had to take.<br><br>I generated a commission of $500.00 per closed deal. When your a twenty something kid and your making $500.00 a deal, it&#39;s huge. If I did 5 per month, that was $2500.00 and back then that&#39;s like making $10,000 per month today.<br><br>Now the note buyer would buy the first, the builder would hold the second for income. The note servicer would collect both payments and simply mail back to the builder his payment, minus fees.<br><br>Now why would a buyer do this deal? the reason is that they couldn&#39;t buy a new home any other way and the two payments were not much more than what they would pay a bank anyway.        </p>

          We Are All Here To Learn:<br><br>Thank you Molly for defending my case; as I stated in my Comments, we are at the beginning of our journey, and since there are not two deals alike, it’s important to understand why a deal would be a Go or No Go, so we don’t waste our time or Sal’s time; each type of deal must be given a special consideration, and I strongly believe that the opinion exchange between Sal and I was great and beneficial for all of us, so I would like to thank Sal as well for his time and patience. <br>Molly your statement was exactly my point: We simply want to understand our deals and what makes them a good or bad candidate for the capital investment. Sal was willing to share with me his words of wisdom in his responses to my questions and I hope we all did enjoy our exchange of opinions. <br>I think we need deal assessment reviews in the Comment section, because there is a lot to be learned from them, and I believe all of us could greatly benefit from it. Asking questions of understanding cannot harm anybody, but help. <br>Thank you Molly and thank you Sal!         </p>

          Sal,<br>I have a deal coming across this weekend and I&#39;ve already been informed already about what asset classes comprise this portfolio of bulk properties.<br><br>Here&#39;s the story. Wealthy Jewish businessman going back to Tel Aviv, buying into technology company. Wants to liquidate all his properties. <br><br>There is a mix of SFR, Commercial, Multi Family. He is looking for .38 cents on the dollar. We cannot carve out, it&#39;s an all in. This is a total divestiture of a portfolio. <br><br>Here&#39;s where my question comes out of. There is land mixed in, zoned for commercial. My question is, if it&#39;s a portfolio you&#39;d want to acquire, on a situation like this, would you take the land to get everything else that can be immediately used?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Where are these located? You can cross these assets quickly *if they are in desirable areas*. If they are in Detroit, don’t waste your time. <br><br>The bids on these are prepared as follows: <br><br>1. *“All In Bid*.<br>This is the total bid for the pool. IN your case, 38%. But 38% of what? Value? BPO? Are these loans? <br><br>2. *“Asset-Level Bid”*<br>This is an *“individual bid”* where we “hang a number” on *each asset*. So if we were to look at this, the land would probably be discounted to zero bid. Yes, I know it’s zoned, but as you have seen in Land Development Financier™ only 5% in the industry actually know what “zoned” means as a function of value and how prices are discovered. <br><br>So I would be interested to look at this and perhaps we *could* cross a trade with someone else. But if the assets are crap, then no dice. <br><br>Sal <br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have two Ohio deals for portfolios of SFR&#39;s to submit tonight. My question is this. Since Canton Ohio is not a Tier 1 city, is this a market you&#39;d consider making a play in? The first portfolio is 68 SFR&#39;s, all tenanted and seller is flexible. I got this directly from the owners of the assets and they just sent me the second deal that I&#39;m going to review.<br><br>As always, I&#39;m working g through the night. I can sleep when my bank balance is at a very high 7 figures, until then it&#39;s chase the deal, chase the compensation but above all else, build a relationship.        </p>

          James<br><br>I don&#39;t sleep either. <br><br>Here is my question. I&#39;m betting that the person who owns this is a private seller or a hard money lender/private lender. <br><br>This type of housing stock is usually low-balance, rough product &quot;rehabber specials&quot;. <br>If the values are below 60K, we&#39;re going to carve those out or provide a 0 bid for them. <br><br>So with that said, what do you have. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Re:Re:Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>You stated that: “The main issue why this is a pass is because one of the main tenants leases expire in 2015”….so let me rephrase what it has been said about this tenant: “Siemens Electronics: Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement; Gross Income = $389,389”<br><br>So the lease will be renewed.  Would a new lease change your mind or there it will be something else? <br>Also, please explain why you don’t consider the cross-collateral as a very strong decision maker.  You can easily sell the shares and recover the capital if things go sour. The cross-collateral is practically yours.  I really need to better understand your reasoning. <br>I greatly appreciate your time and feedback on this deal, but as deals start flowing in my office, it’s important to understand the specifics on why deals won’t pass.

        <p>
          Fulga<br><br>So we’re back to the question. Will Siemens Electronics renew after 2015? Are they “pregnant” or not? If so, have the renewed formally and how long is the lease term? What&#39;s changed in the past 24 hours since I believe you stated they weren&#39;t going to renew? This is something that doesn&#39;t happen overnight. It happens over a protracted period of negotiations. <br><br>(And any new &quot;news&quot; will spook investors like us and is a reason why we put these deals on ice for a period of time for the truth to come out...)<br><br>I think cross collateral is great, but if I’m promising an investor a coupon each month, it doesn’t make sense for any lender to make a loan against something – albeit cross collateralized – that will lose value in less than 9 months because a major tenant is moving out.<br><br>Cross collateralization is not a *reason* to make a loan itself, but rather an extra comfort that your over secured should anything go bad. Its also an excuse for a Federal Bankruptcy Judge to nullify the cross-collateralization clause as it can been seen as being &quot;predatory&quot; in some states because we made a loan that was cross collateralized knowing that a) the tenant was moving out and, b) as a result, they didn&#39;t have income to make the debt payments, and c) we foreclosed on the collateral. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>

          Fulga, I am enjoying reading this, however, I am confused, do you want this to be funded or not??? As I told you on our call, you need to have additional capital providers. The number one reason capital providers got into trouble back a few years ago was by just simply writing checks for investments that were not worthy of funding.<br><br>Sal has said its a pass, he has stated that here and you acknowledged it as such. He gave you his reasons and right now at this point, I fail to see why you simply do not look elsewhere for funding.<br><br>At this point from my view and I&#39;m going to say the view of others here that your trying to call Sal to the mat and make him look bad. Sal has said in the past that 1) he is not obligated to fund any intermediaries deal just because they spend money with him and 2) he will not be strong armed into funding anyone&#39;s deal.        </p>

          I don&#39;t think Fulga or anyone wants to make Sal look bad.  We are all grateful for his expert training.  We simply want to understand our deals and what makes them a good or bad candidate for his  capital investment.  We all want and need deals to go through.  You bring up a good point ...is it Jim? Capital consulting team.  How can we make the deal work by getting other capital providers to spread the risk or is it just a bad deal?  That is all we want to know. Why it is a bad deal and or what we can do to make it better or to work?        </p>

          Thank you Sal.  Happily I do understand what you are saying.  It has taken some time but I think I am getting it.  Your capital providers are guaranteed a coupon, income check, on a monthly basis and you can&#39;t provide that if the value is depleted due to a vacancy.  We don&#39;t go by a promise of a renewal.  Only a signed agreement will do. (pregnant test positive)         </p>

          Molly, I appreciate your feed back. I understand members wanting to understand the why and why not. I also understand wanting to know why a deal gets passed on. Were all here to learn.<br><br>However, when someone turns a post into something personal and uses strong words like &quot; I don&#39;t get you Sal&quot;, that&#39;s when I feel like I do and why I came across the way I did.<br><br>I think AskDandrew is a great forum for learning not only from Sal but one another. I value everyone here as a professional.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I will not be on the call today. I&#39;ve got a call with the banker and his admin and the CFO for the bank to get things rolling, and it conflicts with today&#39;s call with Dandrew. I&#39;m investing a lot of time with these guys because were building a relationship.<br><br>I wanted to put out something on here and I was going to actually do a live *6 comment. Here goes.<br><br>Gals and guys<br><br>Sal is not going to fund every deal that any of us at any level submit, it&#39;s that simple. Sal and AJ have posted the new programs and that is what they are going to fund outside of bulk REO/asset deals and loan pools. <br><br>Sal has made it clear he will not fund a deal just because we spend money with him and Dandrew and he will not be strong armed into funding a deal.<br><br>Sal and Dandrew operate funds, this us what institutional based hedge funds do. Each fund has specific goals and initiatives and submitted deals must fit into that. If it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s a pass, very simple.<br><br>This is why you must, must, must have relationships with other capital providers. This is just simply prudent business. When Sal says pass, it&#39;s for reasons that he makes evident.        </p>

          Hi Sal,<br>I&#39;m listening to one of the Arbitrage live video tapes, you mentioned an intermediary was paid a consultant fee from a builder in showing how to sell using seller financing and a percentage of the profit. The builder more than likely made a loan from a commercial bank and he may or may not have an turbo clause in his docs. My question to you is getting a consultant fee from the builder using seller financing. Please elaborate.<br>Thanks,<br>Dexter          </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to comment on the value of what those here receive from their connection with you. I have said it before, I am not a spokesman paid or otherwise for Dandrew. I am a member here like others are.<br><br>I don&#39;t know about the contents of every program Sal has created however the one thing I do know is that the materials are not just for use with putting deals together to ship over to Sal and Dandrew. <br><br>I can tell you with certainty that if it were not for what I&#39;ve learned from Sal and Dandrew, I wouldn&#39;t have got my foot in the door at several very large capital providers outside of Dandrew.<br><br>Do I use other providers? I do and not because I want to be less than loyal to Sal, but the main reasons are 1) it&#39;s a prudent business practice 2) Sal and Dandrew don&#39;t fund every type of deal 3) I&#39;m in business to solve problems and make money.<br><br>Okay then how do you leverage yourself into other capital providers trade desks? By using your intellectual capital. If you have an understanding of the dynamics of a variety of transaction types, you will impress others and be invited to the party, because the person or entity inviting you, has confidence in the fact they are dealing with a worthy professional.<br><br>Sal once said to me that more people never submit deals than those that do and they pay for the right to do something but choose to do nothing. This is the you can walk a horse to water but can&#39;t make it drink syndrome.<br><br>My guess is people tried and failed and quit. What generally happens to those is that the very next deal would have closed. If you quit, what are you going to do then?<br><br>Most business opportunities that are advertised only make one person rich, the one selling you the opportunity that never worked for them. Most people who own small businesses remain small because they don&#39;t have the performance matrix for success that they want others to believe.<br><br>If someone has a successful business, do you really believe they are going to put it together in some Ebook and sell it to the public for $29.95?<br><br>You can choose to work or quit, it&#39;s that simple. There are billions of dollars in transactions available all over the US, do you believe that there are enough financial houses to close this business?        </p>

          PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>Located approximately 30 minutes north of Atlanta, GA in the Johns Creek Industrial Park.  The project was built in 2008 by Kaiser Development Corp. Current Owner purchased this asset for $7,800,000. The note was then sold to another lender and once it matured in 2011, the lender has foreclosed on the property (said illegally), but it agreed to sell it back to the owner for $5,400,000.<br><br>Purchase = $5,400,000 <br>As- Is value = $7,700,000 (appraisal available)<br>Loan = $5,400,000<br>LTV = 70%<br>Cross-Collateral Performing Assets in NY and FL with 100% occupancy, owned free and clear = $4 Mil; All assets are<br>       performing. DO not want to sell anything to buy this asset, but use as a cross- collateral id needed.<br>NOI= $468,000<br>Proforma NOI = No idea for now<br>Occupancy= 47% (low occupancy since this is a REO, plan in place to increase to 100%)<br>SqFt= 145,783<br><br>Current Tenants:<br>Siemens Electronics: Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement; Gross Income = $389,389 <br>Get Air Suwanee Parks: Lease Expires in 2020; Annual Gross Income =$308,016<br><br>Story: Building built in 2008. Sponsor is 100% experienced, and manages other three commercial assets owned free and clear. Low occupancy is due to the fact that this is a REO. Sponsor has plan in place to increase occupancy to 100%. He is considering using one of his free and clear owned assets to take an additional “value added” loan to increase the occupancy at 100%. The two loans can be combined.<br><br>Exit Strategy= Refinancing, cash out by selling the cross-collateral assets if necessary. <br><br>Since we are at the beginning of learning about your deal acceptance requirements, I am submitting some deals in this forum.

          Fulga, there are some very creative things that can be done here. The best strategy is to place the three free and clear properties into a LLC and refinance the properties with the new LLC assuming the debt, using income from all three to pay the debt.<br><br>Use the refinance proceeds to pay off the one property and sell it to the new LLC. The new LLC now has increased value and then sell off each space in the foreclosed property to the tenants. Owning is always more attractive than leasing.<br><br>Use the sale proceeds to retire all the debt and the LLC has increased it&#39;s value a lot.        </p>

          Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse<br><br>As stated in my Comment Post, I did not post this deal with the purpose to be approved, but rather to better understand your position on situations where there is an asset that is purchased at 30% below market value, request for financing is 100% and there is cross-collateral owned free and clear that could be easily sold to recover the capital. There are great discussion points that we could all benefit from, so let’s start by answering your questions the best I can:<br><br>1.  Your sponsor is asking for 100% of the Purchase Price. They just merely increased or had the appraisal clock in at a level that would make it look like it would be financed at 70%. This is why we ask for the 5 Data Points as we can see through the deal clearly.<br>Answer: If I understand your response correctly, we should be skeptical of deals where the sponsor does not have “skin in the game”, even if there is an appraisal report showing more than 25% equity, and there is solid cross-collateral. So far 50% our sponsors request capital for assets purchased at a discount with equity higher than 25%, and present to us appraisal reports to confirm the equity. I know the answer to this is:  “it depends” on the deal…market tier, class asset, sponsor experience, etc… My take on this is that the Exit Strategy is a good decision factor on deals like this. If one can easily recover the capital with minimum risk, than the deal merits further consideration in my opinion. When I see “Refinancing” as an Exit Strategy, I am skeptical because we all know how expensive and painful the foreclosure process is. As an investor, I like deals where I can get the Deed of a cross- collateral asset that I could sell fast and recover my capital in case the sponsor defaults…but this is just me! This sponsor has 3 assets owned free and clear in NY and FL as a cross-collateral, and that’s the main reason I presented this deal for discussion.  <br><br>I know we should be skeptical about an appraisal value provided by sponsor, however, the validity of the value is always confirmed as part of the “due diligence” as the expense of the sponsor.  <br><br>To conclude this, please elaborate further so we could all learn: How should we approach deals where a sponsor requests 100% financing when they are buying back their property/note from the bank at a 25% and up discount? They provide an Appraisal report from a credible company proving the fair market value. Shall we say “No”, upfront even if there is cross-collateral? Shall we consider other factors as tier market, class asset, etc. in addition to cross-collateral? <br><br>2.  Regarding “Where are the 5 data points? It seems as though you broke a few rules here and did it the “Fulga Way”, <br>Answer: Sorry if you feel that I broke the rules, because the 5 data points were presented in the narrative as follows: <br><br>1.  Current NOI: $468,000<br>2.  Proforma NOI: No Idea (it was really stupid for me to say that: I should have stated in a different way; good point to beat on me! On my defense, this was a deal for discussion, not for approval. Anyway, the Infographic states that Pro forma is a “TYPICALLY a COMPLETE LIE”, but I really understand its merit. <br>3.  Debt stack: $7,800,000 (so there is no overleverage) <br>4.  Sources and Uses: Purchase<br>5.  Exit Strategy: Refinancing and contingency as Cross-collateralization <br><br>3.  As you know, REOs don’t have any loans, so when you mention 2 loans can be combined confuses me.<br>Answer: As stated in my Comment, the sponsor would like to get an additional loan, if possible. Since there are 3 assets as cross- collateral, we could “refinance” one of them, and the sponsor would use the money to add value to the subject property. This was very appealing to me that made the deal stronger.<br><br>4.  Regarding the tenant: “Lease Expires in 2015, re-newel agreement.” This is the equivalent of asking a woman if she is pregnant or not: Has it been renewed or not? That is a very critical part of this. Only 2 answers will suffice. If they didn’t renew, that will break the deal.<br>Answer: Lessons learned: We should have just stated: Lease Expires in 2015, without including that there is an agreement for renewal…or present fact for the Lease Renewal. Good point!<br><br>We are at the beginning of this journey with you, and as you stated so often in your videos, one needs to date before marrying ...so we are in the dating period to better understand the deals that should NOT be submitted. We receive many deals where the 5 points look pretty good, but instead of submitting the deal immediately, we are digging further, and we see issues that surface.  Honestly, I understand why many deals submitted with the 5 data points get rejected. I think that additional points should be added to pre-qualify a deal…that would make the process more efficient….but again…I just started this business and have a lot to learn. <br><br>Thank you for your help.        </p>

          Fulga<br><br>I understand what you are talking about here. Let’s remember a few things, and I have to continue to remind myself that I’m dealing with a highly-educated engineer here, so we can communicate correctly. You like the facts, or what someone tells you are “facts”. More on that in a moment.<br> <br>1. We created the 5 Data Points as a *pre-qualification only* to see if we should have a “second date”. More info from this is adding too many ingredients to the soup and can spoil (or fool) the Intermediary easily who is newer. <br><br>2. My answers are to train you and everyone to *think critically about deals*.<br><br>My old boss at GS once told me “always assume the guy on the other side of the trade is looking to [fool] you”. <br>The fact that they want 100% of purchase price is OK, *but it’s the basis we don’t know*. Appraisals are not taken seriously by anyone. <br><br>So what do we do? We look at the a) *UPB* (Unpaid Principal Balance) and, b) *price-per-pound*, or what similar assets have traded at. (The subscription website you showed me would give you this very important info, by the way!). That will tell us if we’re really getting in at a good basis or not. <br><br>Don’t get me wrong, we’ve funded 100% of DPOs before and we’re fine with that so long as, among other things, we’re in at a *good basis*. <br><br>Put another way, if I had a 1 oz Gold Coin, we know that these are currently going for ~$1,400 an ounce that I could buy, I’m almost certain you would fund me at a purchase price (“basis”) at $400, $500, maybe even $900 using that gold as collateral. <br><br>But if I were to tell you I was buying this for $1200, you may not be so excited with the basis I’m getting this deal at and want me to put some fresh equity in. <br><br>Your Pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Fulga, I enjoyed our conversation today. However, let me say this. Even know my firm is not in the business of acquiring properties, I have bought some in the past. Sometimes, if a property is sold at 30 cents on the dollar it&#39;s because that&#39;s all it really is worth in today&#39;s quick sale dollars.<br><br>This is a strategy hard money lenders will use to determine what a property is worth to them Some hard money lenders understand an appraisal isn&#39;t worth the paper it&#39;s written on, so they will use quick sale value.<br><br>To those reading this and wonder what that term means, it means the following. If a property has a future value or after repair value of $100,000.00 and it&#39;s purchased for $45,000.00 or 45% of future value! then what can a hard money lender sell it for right now if they had to foreclose. <br><br>If you said $45,000.00 your incorrect because this is what was paid for it, not what it&#39;s actually worth. If you bought correctly because you knew what you were doing, you&#39;d have a property worth more than you paid, if your lacking knowledge, you&#39;d pay too much.<br><br>I have an idea how to structure this so it could be funded. Give a few minutes to digest this.        </p>

          Re:Re: PURCHASE of a Mixed Use: High End Office Condos and Warehouse <br><br>Sal, I don’t get you, sorry! <br>Why the UPB should be part of qualifying this deal? Aren’t the Fair Market Value (FMV), LTV and Exit Strategy what matter, so one could assess the risks and mitigate them if needed to recover the capital? Everything in life and business is risk management and mitigation, so one could avoid doing damage control; that’s why I consider Refinancing as an Exit strategy pretty risky because foreclosure as a mitigation is very painful and costly…but I love cross-collateral where I can get the shares of the company (or the deed) and I can easily recover my money.  <br><br> What would I care if the sponsor bought the property at a peak or valley market and the UBP is higher or lower TODAY? All I should care is how much I can sell the asset and / or the cross-collateral TODAY.<br>Regarding everything else you said…so true. But please believe me…I am hard to get by being fooled by people (I die hard, if you saw the movie).<br>So, is this deal a NO?        </p>

          Fulga, <br>You make excellent points. My answers have to do with my knowledge of the market. The market is pragmatic, and everything here is technical.<br><br>Let me explain: <br><br>Technically speaking, yes, a refinance into a conduit loan is an exit strategy. <br><br>Pragmatically speaking, however; if banks aren’t lending right now refinance is a bad option. Only an outright sale. <br><br>The main issue why this is a *pass* is because one of the main tenants leases expire in 2015. Then what? Who do they have lined up for this specialized space? Anyone different would incur large T&amp;I expenses. Then there are rent concessions. <br><br>This isn&#39;t as easy as getting a conduit or larger syndicated loan for a retail, or multi-family asset. Those happen every day. <br><br>Does this make sense? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Tobias: <br><br>This sounds like a recipe for disaster. I see you’ve been with us for about 3 months now. Which is great. But the scenario you laid out here is that your “partner” has experience. <br><br>Then your “partner” knows a guy who has experience. <br><br>Now, I’m a mentor to you guys, but I can tell you that if you’re going to do a deal like this, you need to have the best and most experienced operator you can. <br><br>For these obvious reason, we’re a pass. <br><br>*Simply knowing a guy who knows a guy isn’t a recipe for success.* If this deal is a real deal, and right now we don’t know and - no one wants to know until you have an experience operator who is your partner in this deal as referenced by an Operating Agreement and laid out business plan for how you’re going to manage the asset – you essentially don’t have an opportunity. Just a deal that a seller agreed to a price, and relatively speaking that could be a bid too high for all your investors know. <br><br>Keep going through the materials. This will become apparently clear to you the longer you’re with us. <br><br>Your Pal,<br>Sal        </p>

          Okay, I understand your point.  I honestly still want try my best in getting funding. Although we are both beginners we both have the drive and character to be successful.  At 24, I would love nothing more than to concentrate on this full time and get out of the &quot;rat race.&quot;  I know what you mean in that the risks are high and could be a disastrous deal but at this stage in my life I would rather say oh well and learn the mistakes instead of saying what if.  Are there any other resources you can share with me to reach out to and get funding?<br><br>Thank you Sal,<br><br>Tobias        </p>

          Sal, here are the nuts and bolts of the property.  It is currently occupied by one tenant possibly two but that is in doubt as the bank has not been in the property in over a year.    Tenant/owner declared bankruptcy so as far as I know there are no guarantors that are enforceable on this property. The tenant/owner, a church had been paying  $10,000 per month for two thirds of the building. Building was owned prior by a credit union. Bank financed 2.8M note. When the bank gave notice of acceleration in January Tenant/owner tried to renegotiate the term of the loan out past 2015 and asked to reduce the debt.  The bank refused and is prepared to filed for foreclosure to take place on May 22 ( the foreclosure, not the notice).  The tenant stopped paying when the notice was given in January.  According to good commercial brokers in the area this is a relatively hot area and stabilized it should have a gross of 225-250K and a net of 160-175K.  The building is in very good shape from what I can tell and seven years ago 300-350K was put into the property to upgrade systems etc.  Its a three level brick building that has potential for signage for a user that would be seen by 50-100K cars a day.  Has surface parking of around 35-40 spaces and good linkage. Five minutes from DC line. I have pictures of the property I could email you and the summary page from a prior appraisal that is too old to be of value.  Basically its about 53/foot purchase, way below replacement cost.  The space is being marketed by a broker at $19/ft triple net.  Net rentable is about 15,000 square feet. Doesn&#39;t appear that roof or systems are not in good shape. The address of the collateral is 3900 48th Street Bladensburg, MD 20710.  Look forward to your thoughts.<br><br> Jim        </p>

          <br> Maryland office building of 19,000 square feet<br> Occupied by owner tenant, last payment was January 2014 due to acceleration notice<br> Owner/tenant declared bankruptcy and it is believed that not guarantors are available<br> Note unpaid balance is estimated at 2.8M<br> Property should gross 230-250K and net 160-175K/year<br><br> Tenant/owner was paying 10,000/month for approximately 60% of the rentable space which is about 15,000<br> Property has about 35-40 surface parking spaces<br> Property appears to be in reasonably good shape, no known major systems or capital expenditures<br> Owner/tenant wanted bank to extend loan beyond 2015 and make it a 20 or 25 year term with reduced principal, not sure what that is<br> Strategy 1 would be to make them a tenant with option with six months of rent paid into escrow, default judgement and six months to payoff note at say 1.8-2.0M.<br> Strategy 2 would be to re tenant the building or sell with seller financing with underlying note of 1.0 M and 2.5 sales price.        </p>

          Who was the tenant? This sounds empty and with no sponsor or meaningful tenants. As a rule, we can&#39;t fund churches as that goes against our P&amp;Ps. <br><br>Also, seems small,with 160-175 Net NOI, this falls below our 2mm minimum threshold at a 10% (assuming a value of 1,600,000 to 1,750,000). <br><br>This is a pass. Please don&#39;t take it personally, just find something better. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Hi Sal, <br><br>I got a response back that it was all cash Bankruptcy sale. I don&#39;t think the guy knows what I am talking about. I am going to look up the owner and send them a letter. Any suggestions on how or what to say to them? <br><br>Thank you, Joseph.        </p>

          Good Morning Sal,<br><br>I got a response from the Agent that listed the property and they represent the Bankruptcy Trustee. So does that mean that the person that owns the propery is not his client? If so I want to contact them and see if this is something that is workable. Any suggestions on what to say or include? FYI, the Cap Rate is almost 10% according to the info I seen online.<br><br>Thank you, Joseph.        </p>

          Joseph<br><br>I would strongly suggest that you get the DIP Financier. I see that you don&#39;t have this however, it also comes with a book of scripts that includes: <br><br>a) phone scripts<br>b) email scripts / auto-responders<br><br>The promotional price is still here as the website isn&#39;t up yet so I can still offer this to you. <br><br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathnifif<br><br>This should - and probably will - answer all your questions about communicating with these trustees and owners in distress. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to thank you for teaching us all, how to get into the industry and taking time away from an already full plate to help those here.<br><br>Since getting the PE program, I have just entered into an agreement, I mean just signed and faxed over all the agreements to do what I am going to tell you about.<br><br>I am working with my son who is a dentist and his partner as well as a local attorney to raise money from the medical community to acquire a medical clinic in Dallas that has been closed for years. Once acquired, it is going to be fully rehabbed and bought up to standards and it is going to be turned into a one day surgery center for medical procedures and dental procedures.<br><br>The attorney and my son and his business partner who is also a dentist have created a list of doctors who have made these types of investments in the past. We are going to host a luncheon in May, where a presentation of the project will be made and I will do the capital raise presentation.<br><br>I am creating the pitch book, the financial models of costs and other financial projections, P&amp;L profile, marketing plans, etc.<br><br>I valued the pitch book at $10,000.00, my time to set this up at $12,000.00 for three weeks of work and $2500.00 per day fee to do the luncheon presentation. In exchange, I will own 10% of the project, have an option to invest additional monies in facility number 2, they are planning to do 5 across the state of texas over 6 years. I will get 10% of the monthly profits each month there are profits.<br><br>If it were not for your teachings, I wouldn&#39;t be undertaking something like this.        </p>

        <p>
          Sal,<br>I wanted to just send something general about my experiences with Dandrew and yes I&#39;m going to raise my skirt a little. This us my third go around with Dandrew. The first two times I came in through the $1.00 offer and the first time my credit card declined and the girl in the office shut me out.<br><br>The second time, I was recovering from a truck/car accident and my compensation checks stopped and I missed a payment and I was shut out because of previous experiences.<br><br>They say the third time is a charm and that is a real understatement, Sal flat out said, I&#39;m going to give you another shot however know that you screw this up, your done for good. If we don&#39;t have a wall of shame well just throw your pic up on a wall, well no he didn&#39;t go that far but I could see it.<br><br>The things I am doing, that I write about come from Sal&#39;s teachings, which is what it&#39;s designed to do. Let&#39;s all be honest, Sal doesn&#39;t need to do this.<br><br>He doesn&#39;t need to work on a Sunday, creating products, infographics, taking time away from family, flying coast to coast to get back to Vegas after doing regular business stuff, to wake up and do this all over again.<br><br>Sal has said, they aren&#39;t getting rich off Dandrew Media. The revenues cover costs. Dandrew drives revenues from deals they do in the NYC offices and what we send them that gets funded.<br><br>I think i am safe in saying Sal wants us all to do the larger deals because this is what everything he is teaching is geared towards. Why would you want to do small deals? when you focus on small deals, your limiting your income potential. Also realize that small deals are nit always deals at all, so why spin your wheels.<br><br>Let&#39;s look at it another way. You want to be known as a major player in the business and you make contact with someone such as a real estate broker. You talk about credibility, what you can do for them, your a mover and a shaker and then you answer their question of so tell me what deals you&#39;ve done and you tell that person, well I did a $500,000.00 loan two months ago, and I consulted on a loan pool of 6 loans for $375,000.00.<br><br>What do you think that contact is thinking about you? Well if they are trying to scale their business and get to the $5,000,000.00 deal flow level, your not going to get them there and they will look elsewhere.<br><br>Most realtors and real estate brokers have 1 or 2 funders they refer business to on a regular basis, you will never be invited to the party if you don&#39;t begin marketing to the class of deal makers you have the tools at your disposal to work with.<br><br>Please know you don&#39;t have to transact business on Loop Net, you don&#39;t have to work with some small real estate brokerage that may have deals once a year.<br><br>You can call Marcus and Milichap, Re/Max Commercial, the NAI brokerages and confidently talk and be the gal/guy who walks the walk. <br><br>If you get your foot in the door at one of these large commercial real estate entities, you will see your business explode overnight. How do I arrive at this conclusion. Well, Marcus and Milichap currently has in excess of 10,000 commercial real estate brokers nationwide. Do you think there&#39;s a good chance of getting some deal flow? do you think your clients will be experienced sponsor operators? Is it entirely possible that they need capital because banks aren&#39;t funding but your capital provider Dandrew is. Do you think you&#39;ll be dealing with entities that will be doing more than one deal this year and will come back to you again on the next one?<br><br>If your dealing with loan pools, there are three key phrases I&#39;ve discovered that get ears perked up and I got these from Sal. They are Were Principal Bids, Were looking at Performing, NPN, Re-Performing and scratch and Dent and We are Direct to Buyer. <br><br>Were principal bids tells the banker that you are not shopping deals. Were looking at performing, non-performing, re-performing and scratch and dent tells the banker that your a problem solver and a single source deal house, meaning they don&#39;t have to deal with multiple buyers. Were direct to buyer tells the banker that you have access to the capital to buy from them.<br><br>Bankers are interested in one thing, can you get the deal done and if you understand what Sal has made available to you, you will be able to.<br><br>Being aligned with Sal and Dandrew has given me the confidence to be able to look at every deal and be able to talk to anyone in the business. I am thinking your on the same page.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I am sitting here on a Sunday morning working, getting ready for tomorrows calls with several banks in the DFW area. I received a very interesting email that a broker forwarded to me by accident, I am certain because he lifted his skirt big time.<br><br>It was a email from a seller to him. I am posting the main part of it.<br><br>Dear  Steven,<br>This opportunity is going out to three brokers I have hand picked from prior experiences, your one of them. You have seventy two hours to submit your brokerages Letter of Interest and Proof of funds, to be used only in event you locate buyer, a contract for acquisition is consumated and the buyer does the eleventh hour bail out.<br><br>Please send via Fed EX, using Transaction Code 7712PNPNWestEastSouthwest. Thank you in advance.<br><br>This is a eye opener because it validates the point that brokers need buyers POF&#39;s to get into the party. I remember doing a real estate deal in Brooklyn, NY years ago that was where my partner was able to get into the deal by using my pof/bank statement. My partner locked up the deal with a thirty day option and $3,000.00 option consideration fee and his plan was to say to the seller that he was not able to go through with the purchase but has a partner who has indicated his willingness to do the deal and as good faith provided his pof.<br><br>For those here that are not investors right now but want to be, the above strategy is a very easy one to implement. You find a property and get it under contract.<br><br>You then begin marketing the property and once you have a solid buyer willing to do the deal, you have the buyer provide his/her POF along with an offer.<br><br>You go back to the seller and you say, I have a buyer who is going to partner with me. Since he/she will be the one arranging or providing funding, here is our POF.<br><br>You then simply assign your interest over to your partner after closing and walk away with your check.. Very real and very easy to do.        </p>

          Hello Sal,<br><br>I&#39;ve noticed several times you&#39;ve mentioned to students to take a consulting fee for their advice to clients.  I understand a consulting fee for raising capital, or placing capital, but can you elaborate on charging a consulting fee for providing strategic advice?  What I mean, more so, is how and what to charge the client?  Due to intellectual capital and good &#39;ole common sense, it seems natural to me to provide strategic consulting, like that of an outside coach.  Just unsure how to protect myself and what to charge.<br><br>Thanks for the feedback!<br><br>Chris        </p>

          Chris. <br><br>I&#39;m going to be talking about this a little at the SDIRA workshop. Quite frankly, students/Intermediaries have been running with it themselves and I got the idea from what they were doing. <br><br>The point of the matter is that at some point, something bad is going to happen in the market and people will be rushing into real estate, as they are now. <br><br>The problem is that they don&#39;t know where their money is going and that is how bad things happen.<br><br> Questions such as: <br><br>*&quot;Where in the capital structure is your money going?&quot; <br>(&quot;Do you know what capital structure is?&quot;)*<br><br>*&quot;What is the experience of your sponsor?&quot;*  <br><br>*&quot;How are you pricing this Bulk NPN, REO, etc. portfolio you&#39;re buying?&quot;*<br><br>These are the soft-sale questions that many an Intermediary have asked an investor asking them to do due diligence for a deal. And its the hook that the savvy Intermediaries are using to make people think twice about what they are doing with their own money. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>Wow the wheels are turning in the old idea chamber this morning. I got to thinking after I faxed off the deal stuff earlier and wanted to throw this out there for others.<br><br>There are tremendous opportunities to do big things in this business with the intellectual capital Sal and Dandrew have provided, if you just look around you.<br><br>Ever drive by an Apartment Building and said to your wife or husband, wouldn&#39;t it be nice to own that building? ever pass by a business that has a line out the door and thought to yourself, wow, who ever owns that is making a killing?<br><br>Ever go to your regular gas station and saw the owner and wondered where that guy got the money? well you can own pieces of properties and projects and businesses without borrowing, without having two nickels to rub together.<br><br>Your ticket to entry is your intellectual capital. Money has a value that in the right circles, multiples fast. To the untrained eye, a dollar buys a dollar worth of goods and services. To the trained eye, a dollar buys a lot of alot.<br><br>Some here are at the Private Equity level of Dandrew Intermediaries. Sure, we&#39;ve paid for this right and the return with regard to tools and education and know how is part of it and all at an advanced level.<br><br>For our investment, we learn the very powerful concept of Joint ventures along with other concepts and strategies. You learn about what is called a pitch book. This is a very good tool and it begins your path to getting into deals without money.<br><br>The majority of investors who have an idea and need to raise money through vehicles other than a loan have zero clue about a pitch book and more people know less about how to raise money than those in the know.<br><br>If you value a pitch book at $10,000.00 and you set your fees at $250.00 an hour on the low side to consult and help raise capital, that $250.00 adds up fast. Before you know it, you&#39;ve invested $25,000.00 to $50,000.00 worth of intellectual capital. <br><br>Now why not exchange that for ownership in an apartment buildling, thriving business, etc. Many big business ventures have been started and have grown to massive proportions out of one partner had the capital and the idea and the other had the know how to take all that and make the deal come alive and thrive.<br><br>Microsoft started this way. Does anyone believe Bill Gates had deep pockets when they started? Bill Gates had an idea and an opportunity to leverage a technology no one thought would work or was more than some guys idea pushed off to the side for another day. Paul Allen was the guy with the money and the brains to leverage his money with Bill Gates idea.<br><br>Intellectual capital is your ticket to the big time if you know how to leverage it.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I&#39;ve been working on a few ideas and banking models, such as using the strategy/concept of equity sharing and co-mingling the concept with notes and pools. I will send that when it is done for your opinion.<br><br>I got to thinking about something this morning and wanted to pass this on. As anyone who has been here awhile knows or should know by now, Dandrew is not going to buy up every pool or portfolio submitted. <br><br>Because of the fact that Dandrew is really an institutional capital provider, it is really impossible to buy every deal and it&#39;s based upon the one very real and very key concept of certain pools and portfolios just do not fit into Dandrews clients investment plans.<br><br>Now does this mean that a pool is not a good deal or is a marginal opportunity at best? absolutely not. For those in sales, you understand the concept of a No is not a No, it really is a person saying, right now, this doesn&#39;t work for us.<br><br>So what do you do when Dandrew says no? well if your like most, you&#39;ll just send a email and say its a pass and see you on the next deal. Well you just left money on the table.<br><br>In real estate wholesaling, there is the concept of build a buyers list first, find out your buyers wants and needs and go out into the marketplace and find it. There is zero reason anyone here cannot do the same thing!!!<br><br>Okay so now your thinking wow, this is not easy to do, okay if I do it, if I give this a shot what do I do once I have a buyer? that is the fun part.<br><br>1. You build a profile on each buyer<br><br>2. You send them a partnership agreement that says your part is to source deals, qualify the deal to make sure you are dealing with someone who is direct or the seller themselves. Your doing this for deals your submitting to Dandrew and you&#39;ve already at this point had Dandrew say pass, so your not cheating on Sal. The buyers part is to provide the capital and the POF to do the deal.<br><br>3. You and the buyer close the deal and you work together to either sell the assets, hold for income, etc. You can get paid a portion of the monthly income, a consulting fee on the front end plus a share of profits, you can charge a consulting fee and a piece of the sale proceeds for each individual note or property. The compensation avenues are endless. You could agree to a consulting fee plus one property of your choice from the portfolio, hold that property for rental income or flip it and generate some money to start a retirement fund.<br><br>Why leave money on the table? what doesn&#39;t meet one buyers needs, could very well fit into the plans of another.        </p>

          Sal, AJ and AskDandrew members,<br>The other day I posted about a broker to stay away from. here is the update. I had to end up having a family mermber, who is a actual former FBI Agent send him a email along with a read request receipt. This gentleman immediately shut down his email and his phone goes direct to voice mail.<br><br>The email was as follows:<br><br>Dear Mr. Crawford,<br>You have had some recent dealings with the Principal and Managing Director for Structured Commercial Capital, James Balter. I have been asked to make contact with you and reiterate our firms policy with regard to the types of transactions we undertake and to address some additional key issues with you.<br><br>We are a firm that is deeply engrained in the commercial lending landscape as well as trading bulk assets and loan portfolio opportunities, on a national level platform.<br><br>In addition, we provide consulting services related to raising capital for opportunistic transactions as well as Private Equity for Commercial real estate opportunities, on a national level platform.<br><br>We do not engage in the acquisition of income producing commercial real estate properties, in any asset class. We are not clear as to how you came to the conclusion that we do openly engage in this area of real estate, to the point where you would attempt to solicit our investment/acquisition in two recent projects, a student housing property in New York City, NY as well as a Hyatt Hotel in Jacksonville, Florida.<br><br>While I did say we do not engage in the acquisition of properties, we will refer select opportunities to select individuals and entities that we have a relationship with who are investors.<br><br>After reviewing the opportunities you solicited our involvement with, it was determined that both properties were not for sale at the time you submitted the deals and that in fact, all principals in the transactions have no knowledge of who you are and never entered into an agreement with you on any level or in any capacity. <br><br>As Legal Counsel for the firm and a former FBI Special Agent in The Dallas Texas Office of The Bureau, I have determined that your actions are at the least hinged upon financial fraud as well as criminal in nature. You attempted to sell real property that you had no legal right to and that you have no controlling interest in. In addition, you utilized the internet to transact this business. Both of these activities are felonies in most US Jurisdictions.<br><br>I have referred this matter to The FBI in Dallas, New York City, NY, Jacksonville, Florida as well as The US Attorneys office, requesting immediate and swift legal action be instituted. I have also referred this matter to your local FBI office in Atlanta, Georgia for their review.<br><br>A Cease and decist order is being prepared and will be sent to the address we have on file for you. You are not to make contact with our firm or its Principals and employees moving forward.<br><br>Thank you, regards<br><br><br>It was after he received this email, he can no longer be located. I wanted to share this with everyone.        </p>

          Sal,<br>Here is an update. I spoke with the Bank President again this afternoon. I indicated that we will look at any and all, and here were the fine points I covered.<br><br>1. We like loans, we will look at any and all, however we are not shy about carving out, and that if they are asking for a all-in bid, we are going to looking for loans secured by assets that justify buying the entire portfolio.<br><br>They asked about Fades and I said that is something that could happen, it&#39;s based upon the deal, each strategy is deal specific.<br><br>2. The more information they can provide on the front end results in a smoother bid process and that we are principle bids.<br><br>They asked what we traditionally pay for firsts, seconds, P, NPN, RP and I said every loan is looked at, analyzed, we need to know the story of the deal so everything is deal specific. I then threw this out Sal...<br><br>When you made these loans, every loan decision was made based upon the merits and story of the borrower, the property, the financials, credit standing. You didn&#39;t simply just write a check, so we must be able to make determinations as well.<br><br>I then asked the question of, well how flexible are you going to be on a all-in deal where we may need to kick back some of the loans, are you willing to stand firm on a all-in strategy if allowing some carve outs to make a deal go and they said, we would have to look at the situation if we get there.<br><br>They asked for 7 days to look at what they have closely and see where they stand. I was very encouraged. I am posting this really as an update and to show that if you can become a problem solver while remaining firm, you can get things done.<br><br>Now is there a chance they will choose not to do business? Of course however, I have 57 more banks to call this week and next. I only need one to get some deal flow that can close and make money.<br><br>This was a real confidence builder today.        </p>

          James! Great job. Really appreciate your detail on the deals you are working on- or relationships- actually. I am calling banks as well and making some progress. Have not gotten the replies you have gotten but still have had presidents of banks asking for me to send over an e-mail to let them know what we do and to keep the lines of communication open. Again- thanks for sharing- we can call you- a &quot; mini Sal&quot; lol!        </p>

          Rich,<br>One of the constants I have heard from Sal and learned from is be concise but thorough. I follow the who, what, when, why and how formula when I either speak with someone or email them.. I try to always use the key phrases of does this make sense and I shut up and wait for a reply and that is deal speciific.<br><br>I try not to talk terms because another thing I learned from Sal as well as the time Ive been in the business, once you begin talking terms, the person your speaking with begins to hear what they want to hear, then it&#39;s well you said you pay this or you charge this and if Sal is the capital provider, then your putting him at a pricing disadvantage.<br><br>I have found that bankers talk the talk and walk the I control the deal walk. Its our job to explain to them and show them how in reality, we control the deal.<br><br>As Sal said on The Bulk REO Live program on Day 1, either they want it or they don&#39;t. Its alot easier to approach these bankers when you think in these terms and convey it.<br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I have seen several different tapes in the past week, all different deals, all different assets where some of the assets state FDIC Asset in the comments section.<br><br>Are these treated like any other asset on the tape or are they carved out because they were possibly acquired at an auction where the seller of the pool may not have had the benefit of proper due diligence, modeling of the pool to make the best bid for the pool and priced themselves out of there being any remaining value for that particular asset?        </p>

          How to Get Deals:<br>I just attended the Real Estate Investing Conference in Manhattan, NY and I would like to share with you two important lessons learned. Please note that all speakers (about 15) are well known successful real estate investors/business owners who made a fortune in the financing world.<br>When asked what the key elements of their success were, the answer was:<br>1.  Most of the leads in the financing world come from “relationships”; online, and offline marketing comes next. Obviously it takes time and determination to go out and get a hand shake, but it’s worth it! This was Sal’s advice to me as well: get out of your comfort zone and reach out to bankers, brokers, attorneys, landlords…deals will come exponentially.<br>2.  Never lose focus on what you try to achieve every day, so each time you get distracted, bring yourself back to the task. This is nothing but a mind game to change a habit.<br>All these sound like “common sense”, but it was great to hear it again from successful business owners who started their financial journey like us.<br>Good Luck!<br>Fulga<br>        </p>

          Wonderful Fulga! <br><br>The key takeaway that I think is most important here are *relationships*. <br><br>Let me put this into perspective. None of you on here would buy anything from Dandrew Media if you didn&#39;t have a relationship with us. <br><br>So important today in a world where people are getting blitzed with Social Media. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          James. <br><br>This is something there is no answer for regarding pricing. Every asset is unique and most is contingent upon market prices and time and expense to foreclose on these assets. Those are the drivers for pricing. <br><br>People that want access to the bi-monthly heatmap and pricing model can go here:    <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniett     <br><br>Sal         </p>

I apologize in advance, if this is long winded.<br><br>I do not as a standard policy to bad mouth anyone in our business, whether it&#39;s a broker, intermediary, capital provider, etc. I do not like it or those that engage in it, however, there comes a point in time when someone&#39;s business practices are so wrong that they affect others and can continue to.<br><br>For the past month or so, I&#39;ve been approached by a broker who goes by the name of Marco Crawford. While I cannot speak to others experience with this broker, I can speak to my own.<br><br>He begun by attempting to make trades in Bulk REO and Loan Portfolio deals. I replied to one of his posts because he had what seemed like a good deal. He wasn&#39;t doing the usual send LOI and POF so I responded and asked for the tape and his reply was send LOI and POF. I politely explained we just do not engage in that practice.<br><br>Fast forward a few weeks and I begun receiving deal after deal or I should restate that, opportunity after opportunity. This is now when I began being concerned.<br><br>He attempted to sell a Student Housing property. I have a banker from Dubai that likes these so I emailed a brief overview and two days later received the following by email,<br><br>&quot;Mr. James, I am suspect on this transaction. I spoke with the University in NYC US who says they do not own this property and know nothing about sale. Please advise further my trusted Texan friend.&quot;<br><br>I called Pace University who informed me that they were in a long term master lease and gave me the owners contact information. I called the contact who said the building had been for sale prior to getting Pace University to commit to a very long term guaranteed lease and the property has not been for sale for a long time. I asked the price and they would not disclose it as I knew they would not.<br><br>Marco Crawford was asking $103,000,000.00 and stated my commission is 3%. I contacted him and asked if he is licensed to sell real estate in New York and he replied, he doesn&#39;t sell real estate. <br><br>Recently he sent me a opportunity to acquire a flagged hotel in Jacksonville, Florida for $20,000,000.00. I called the Relevant parties and no one knows this guy. I emailed back this broker, said were interested and asked what his commission would be and he said don&#39;t know. <br><br>It was last night that I saw a email from him, demanding to know where the offer on the Jacksonville Hotel is. I wrote back with this reply... &quot;We are looking at this, we will make an offer if and when we are ready, if it sells it sells&quot; his reply back was Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.<br><br>It is my understanding that Crepig has banned this broker from posting deals because they felt his business practices were a violation of their policies.<br><br>At that point, I decided to formally ask he not send me anymore deals and his reply was &quot;good you didn&#39;t do s--- anyway.<br><br>At the urging of my wife, she said email Sal and let him know what&#39;s going on because at some point in time, and it&#39;s enevitable, this broker will cross paths with other Dandrew Intermediaries and everyone in the field needs to know what they could face.<br><br>Sal and AJ gave me the blessing to post this. Please know once more, it is not my practice to discuss other brokers or judge them for trying to make money through every opportunity to do so, however, this goes above and beyond legitimate business practices.<br><br>Thank you for your time today.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Great call yesterday with you and A.J. Thanks. Wanted to let you know what is hapenning with me. Still calling banks- took a few days off but hitting it hard again Monday. Anyway- short side of it.<br>Had a guy I was talking to- he asked me what the deal was - if I was the end buyer for a pool. I said no- but I am direct with fund- and my job is to underwrite tape( srubb it up) then if it qualifies- I send it off to the fund manager.<br>He then said that he wanted a NDA signed from you guys. I said they will not  that- so I moved on. Just frustrating is all. Banks are my best bet of course. Just wanted to share it so others could see as well. I am not going to send you over anything of no value or waste my time chasing a deal that has no chance of closing. Thanks!        </p>

          It&#39;s not clear in your statement if the guy you were speaking with was a banker. If you sign an NDA with a banker who releases a tape or pool of assets to you, it would be good protocol to inform the banker that you would like to send the list to your capital provider. In that case would he (banker) like to have your capital provider also sign a NDA ? <br>Trying to speak directly to bank asset managers is a frustrating exercise 99% of the time. After being placed on hold you will then be directed to a voice mail. This is by design when you consider how many calls come into a bank looking for this same person. I concentrate on leaving a very professional and to the point message of who I am and what I am looking for. My company name, website URL and my specific interest (NPL&#39;s listed in &quot;non-accrual status&quot; in the banks last quarterly CALL sheet. I then direct them to my &quot;Intelligent Office&quot; phone number and not my cell-phone. I want the banker to call my New York exchange and have my &quot;receptionist&quot; direct his call. This reinforces my credibility along with having a professional website presentation. Since I started this procedure I have had four banks return my call. In two cases, when the receptionist called stating that Mr X from XYZ Bank was on the phone, I was not in an appropriate setting (a loud Pub) to take his call and directed her to state that I was in a meeting. In three cases the asset manager stated that they were not selling but added &quot;at this time&quot; , which is his way of saying &quot; but I can see you are capable of clearing any balance sheet assets when I do need to sell something. The last banker had already liquidated his REO between the 12/31/2013 balance sheet date and the end of March. Keep calling and sooner or later your services will be appreciated.          </p>

          Since asked, what is the minimum amount we look to take down? I was asked if we&#39;ll look at a $10k NP/HELOC or anything in that range. Told him &quot;no&quot; but if I&#39;m wrong I&#39;d like to correct &amp; give a minimum (on a one-off) in the follow-up email I&#39;m sending.        </p>

          Hello Sal!<br>I have a potential client that operates in a Large Northern California market. He is a Commercial developer who Rehabs Mutli Family buildings and Condos. He is a General Contractor and Realtor. He said that the properties in his city move very fast, and when he finds something, they need to be able to write a check on the spot. He says that he needs committed funds for his $5-8mm projects. He is looking for Equity partners, (which I think is the same as Equity Funding). Can we do something like that? I asked if he has a building under contract, and he said he does not, but with his vast network of Realtors, he could have one in a couple of days. Sounds like a long term customer with repeat business. What do you suggest I do?<br>Thanks!<br>Scott        </p>

          He is actually a Licensed Contractor with tons of experience. What he needs is an Equity partner so that he has funds available to move on properties quickly. Do we do anything like this?        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>Need a little clarification re Pref Equity.  In the Structured Products &amp; Equity document you list Commitment Size: $3 - $25 million.  In the email of 3-15-14 about Understanding Mezz Loans vs Preferred Equity one of the points you list is: 7. How Pref and Mezz Amounts Are Calculated. This is something we’ll be doing in slugs of less than $500,000 whereas the market usually won’t go less than $5 million...  <br><br>For an owner who wants to pull some equity out of a property, what is the minimum you will consider?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I won&#39;t post the entire email reply I received today from a bank president post phone call from last week. I found this bank using the FDIC infographic.<br><br>James,<br>I enjoyed our discussion and you made some very good points. Your knowledge of our current position was spot on. When I started the bank I never could have envisioned we would be where we are at today.<br><br>Most phone calls I receive are from entities that have zero business calling in the first place. Your knowledge level is refreshing. Our board has a meeting this week, I believe on Wednesday. I will make it a point to determine what we want to dispose of .<br><br>Will you look at all or do you prefer all non-performing? Please advise on Tuesday. I will look for your call. One remaining question, are you looking to buy on a flow basis? we can turn inventory every thirty (30) until we clear our sheets.<br><br>I posted this to show that what you lay out on the infographic really does work. I received this reply by picking up a telephone and calling. Part if the reason he even spoke with me is because I am direct to the Buyer.        </p>

          To both Sal and James Re: Retail Center in Centennial, Colorado<br><br>Thank you for your responses, your advice would have worked 100% if Time would not Be of Essence: the loan has reached its maturity and there is no time for the land to be sold (Hot Issue as mentioned). Please see my initial comments: The Land sell was the sponsor’s initial strategy, and it was listed last year for $4.5 mil and was under contract for $3.5 mil for 10 months. The deal fell through after 10 months because the buyer did not qualify for the mortgage. Meanwhile the sponsor’s loan has matured and his attorney is finalizing the note buy back at a discount.<br><br>This is a deal where the sponsor is desperate to get the loan to repurchase the note and has enough collateral to minimize the risk. The exit strategy explained included the land sell as a contingency to refinancing.  The only concern here is the fact that the cross-collateral assets are 2 pieces of land in an industrial area, but of a great value that could be sold to experiences developers.<br><br>In case you missed these details, I will ask again: interested?? <br>        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>Just watched a short video of Hassam Nadji with Marcus &amp; Millichap: http://www.marcusmillichap.com/about-us/news-events/videos/2014/04/21/cnbc-worldwide-exchange . Hassam was discussing REITs and that he thinks that the MF REITs are still good but that he likes the Industrial REITs for more growth. Short but worth watching.        </p>

          Sal,<br>On Bulk REO&#39;s what is the significance of properties being all vacant with quit claim deeds where the seller is a private seller as opposed to a banking institution.<br><br>We have a deal in front  of us right now, that has the above characteristics. All SFR&#39;s. Does the fact that they are all vacant make the deal more enticing because there are no tenants or former owners squatting for free to evict?        </p>

          Simple. <br><br>Private sellers aren’t as liquid and thus we have to provide what is called a *holdback* (as discussed in your training module) that will allow most of the proceeds to be released to the private seller, *but a portion that will be held back post-closing* for a pre-determined amount of time or until all agreed upon actions have been satisfactorily completed. <br><br>This could mean anything from getting rid of squatters to making sure that the first month’s payments have *all* arrived to the buyer’s offices or servicing company of the buyer’s choosing. <br><br>Or that all *Transfers and Assignments* have been recorded properly, so the buyer is now firmly in place on the chain of title. <br><br>It’s a “carrot and stick” incentive structure for Bulk REO and NPL trades. <br> <br>Sal        </p>

          Fulga, I would sell one of the parcels of land and use those funds to pay down the note. One big question that comes to mind is what are they doing to increase occupancy above 52%. What is their competitive advantage in the market above 52% of the market. <br><br>The project seems to be heading to overleverageville. Sometimes the answer to the problem is not in adding new capital to the capital stack in existence.<br><br>If they own the land outright, I would place both parcels into a separate LLC and syndicate the deal to two developers, and lend the proceeds to the other entity with a long term note with low interest payments that would be lower than taking on new capital.<br><br>Make the money that&#39;s readily available work for them.        </p>

          Sal,<br> I have been working on several deals over night. I wanted to post my email reply to a broker who just insists that I need to deal with them because they are the door to the seller. I think some of the new people could learn how to be firm from this.<br><br>&quot;I will sign a Confidentiality Agreement that is provided directly to my firm from the seller, however I will not sign a NCND/ NDA/Fee Agreement or any other document. The fact that you are asking me to sign your NCND indicates to me that you are not direct to the seller. Is that correct? I don&#39;t discuss deals with anyone other than the seller, period. I don&#39;t deal with sellers reps or brokers. I don&#39;t deal with anyone who is not in the ownership of the assets because there is simply nothing I need to discuss with you or anyone other than the decision maker.<br><br>It is our policy that we speak to the entity that has the legal authority to speak about the assets. During conversations, there is going to be sensitive information provided between buyer and seller entities and legally speaking, if you have not signed a confidentiality agreement with the seller as well as my firm, we are not able to enter into discussions.<br><br>If you are not the seller, I simply will not and can not entertain any business from you. Thank you.&quot;<br><br>This was provided to a broker who thought because they knew who the seller is and I don&#39;t that they were the person who was going to direct the deal.<br><br>There is the saying that the one who has the money leads the deal. I am the one direct to the capital provider and I am the one who controls the deal.<br><br>        </p>

          Ralph. <br><br>You&#39;re assuming that a borrower is cooperative 100% of the time. The #1 reason why a bank or lender would sell a note is because they believe that: <br><br>a) the borrower is not solvent, needs to be replaced. <br><br>b) the borrower is not experienced, ran the project to the ground. Probably doesn&#39;t want to relinquish control. New note owner will foreclose. <br><br>c) bank or lender is afraid that the borrower many file BK. If this is the case, the lender could be thrown over a barrel. Not good. <br><br>d) bank or lender wants a quick closing and feels as though it is faster - and will discount accordingly - the note for a fast and efficient sale to a strong buyer. No need to play carrot and stick with the current borrower. <br><br>e) Probate issues as borrower / operator has died (happens more than you think)<br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>As I sit here working late into the night or actually the morning, I started to read everything here and started to think how it is possible for new people to be viewing videos, thinking about questions and seeking answers and this is a good thing.<br><br>However, I personally feel that anyone who is new to Dandrew needs to be doing some additional things in addition. First thing is to figure out what you want to do with what you are learning. I know that sounds like a really stupid question but pragmatically speaking, it&#39;s a necessity, its a starting point.<br><br>Next, look at what you have in front of you, look at what this opportunity Sal has made available really encompasses. I don&#39;t care if your a banker level person or a private equity person, your opportunities are huge. How huge? lets take a look.<br><br>Banker level-This is the starting level but not the ending level. You could remain a Banker Level Intermediary for the rest of your life and became financially independent very fast. If you close one deal a month and make 2 points up front and those two points equal out to $50,000.00 or even $30,000.00, that is anywhere from $360,000.00 to $600,000.00 per year and that&#39;s just on points, this is not factoring in interest spreads or back end equity pieces.<br><br>Now I stated financially independent, I did not say wealthy or stinking filthy rich. Financially independent simply means writing your own paycheck, never having to punch a time clock, never having to worry about how you will support your family, unless of course you over leverage your lifestyle and that is possible to do, look at the personal bankruptcy court cases filed everyday in this country.<br><br>I won&#39;t delve into all the different levels of opportunities there are here, because this would be so long winded, and that&#39;s not my intention.<br><br>If you look at the big league players in the financial industry and really look closely at what they do and compare it to what you are able to do, provided you take action and go to work, you will see that there is a very close alignment of interests. This is in every opportunity and program Sal makes available.<br><br>The difference between them and you is absolutely zero. Many have MBA&#39;s however, you do to. Maybe it&#39;s not hanging on the wall, however, in terms of Intellectual Capital, you share the same knowledge base. If you look at commercial lenders websites who loan on the same property types as you can, they get their money from institutional investors and funds and simply lend it out. Where do you get your money from? Dandrew and who is Dandrew? a institutional investor/fund. See the alignment  of interests.<br><br>In closing, let me point out a distinction that will give you some motivation. Your competitors went to college and got a high profile degree and it cost them anywhere from $50,000.00 to $200,000.00 and from that educational journey, these very same financial professionals working on the street and within the industry, doing the very same things Sal and Dandrew have provided for $100.00 to $1500.00, are employees of a firm. You own the firm. They may have the title of Vice-President or President or Director of this or that, however at the end of the day, they are punching a time clock so to speak, and at the end of this year, the year after and the year after, they will still be employees. <br><br>This is how huge this is for you, for me, for everyone.        </p>

          Sal, <br><br>A while back I posted a bridge loan lead in Texas. The developer is seeking $1.5 Mil for a Holiday Inn project. You previously mentioned that I should inquire whether the borrower had obtained an LOI from the franchise. He got back to me, and here was his response:<br><br><br><br>***Email 1***<br><br>Suzette, <br>I would like to close the $1.5 mil. Bridge loan by mid May but know absolute drop dead date. <br>The $11.1 mil. construction loan would be approximately 5 to 6 months later because we will then generate a lot of information we need for the loan during that time including the Franchise. Yes I have talked to Holiday Inn but have not pursued it any further because the next step is to formerly make application and put up my franchise fee, hence Bridge Loan<br><br>***End of Email 1***<br><br><br><br>I responded by communicating the concerns of (1) whether there was anything formalized in writing with the Holiday Inn franchise, and (2) whether there was going to be sufficient time to conduct due diligence prior to closing. Here was his reply:<br><br><br><br><br>***Email 2***<br><br>Suzette,<br>I do not have an LOI from Holiday Inn but have had talks with them and I&#39;m sure in my mind I can get their flag. If your folks wanted to make some type of financing commitment based on an acceptable Franchise then I think we could work with that. <br><br>I assume you must be thinking the construction loan or are you thinking the Bridge Loan. The Bridge Loan decision should not take very long but if you are thinking construction also Then maybe you should look at doing the Bridge with a deal worked out up front on construction loan that would give you the first rights to the construction loan at your option. Anyway I&#39;m just brain storming so give me your thoughts.<br><br>***End of Email 2***<br><br><br><br><br>Sal, your input would be appreciated. <br><br>Before I begin assembling the five data points on this deal, I want to be sure that I am not wasting my time. If this deal shows possibility for Dandrew, under what conditions would this borrower be fund-able? <br><br>Thanks,<br>Suzette<br>        </p>

          Suzette: <br><br>Ground up construction for hospitality, the size of this deal (1.5mm) isn&#39;t really that attractive not just to us, but just at about any institution. <br><br>Good push back regarding the COmmittment Letter from Holiday Inn.

        <p>
          Sal, I should clarify. This is not ground-up construction; but rather, the redevelopment and re-positioning of an existing structure. It is a value-add hospitality project with a local and experienced operator at the helm; this is according to the borrower&#39;s resume and project summary. <br><br>My question is...that if this guy obtains a formal written commitment from the flag franchise first, then would  Dandrew be interested in taking a look at this deal or talking to the guy? Would this deal be worth the investment of time that it would take for me to assemble the five data points?  <br><br>The main issue with this deal is that the property is under contract without a solid commitment from a flag. This does not leave much time for obtaining an LOI from a flag prior to closing. Another issue I see is that it is a $1.5 Mil loan; and not your $2 Mil minimum. A loan request can always be raised to meet a lender&#39;s minimum; however...a question comes to mind regarding the tight closing deadline and written commitment from the flag:<br><br>(1) Could a loan commitment be made subject to borrower obtaining an extension of closing sufficient for lender to complete due diligence; and then condition the funding of escrow on borrower submitting written evidence of commitment from intended flag franchise? <br><br>Just thinking &quot;outside the box.&quot; I need to know how to respond to this borrower. If there are conditions that this particular borrower would have to satisfy in order for this deal to be more feasible to you, then I would like to know what  it is, so that I can communicate this to the borrower. He will either make it happen, or he will not. <br><br>What would this borrower need to do in order to warrant a phone conversation with Dandrew about his bridge loan request? This would seem a logical first step. Please advise.<br><br>The clarity would be appreciated.<br><br>Thanks again,<br><br>Suzette        </p>

          Suzette: <br><br>Some of your comments need some corrective guidance here. <br><br>*1. Would this deal be worth the investment of time that it would take for me to assemble the five data points?*<br><br>This is something you ask for. It doesn’t take time to “assemble”. You’re not putting together a sophisticated model here. Just asking the guy who is supposed to be smart enough to give you these answers if he is asking for millions of dollars… <br><br>2. We just passed on a flagged Hilton in Hartford, CT because one of our lead LPs – who is located in CT – wasn’t bullish on Hartford. <br><br>So, *where is this hotel located?*<br><br>3. Why is this hotel under contract without a flag? What is this guy’s Plan B? <br><br>4. Tell me what you mean by “a loan request can always be raised to meet a lender’s minimum? If I have a car that I can buy for 1.5mm and its worth 2mm, would you lend me 2mm? <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br><br>1. Ok, got it. Five data points are automatic.<br><br>2. Project is located in Tyler, TX<br><br>3. I will ask the borrower why the hotel is under contract without a flag; and whether he has a Plan B in place.<br><br>4. With regards to a borrower raising a loan request, it depends on the value of the deal.  When I made that statement I was thinking in terms of loan-to-value of this deal. The contract is $5,000,000.00; and assuming the property value is $5,000,000.00; a $2,000,000.00 loan would be a 40% loan-to-value. <br><br>It seems logical that a low loan-to-value and short-term loan would be attractive to a lender; because in theory, such a loan should carry less risk than a longer-term bridge loan at higher loan-to-value. <br><br>By the way, I&#39;m not claiming that $5,000,000.00 is the value of the property; I&#39;m just explaining my logic.<br><br>Suzette<br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was on the entire call today and even sat through the Q and A until I had a client call coming in that I had to take. Great call, very informative as always.<br><br>I wanted to pass on something you said to me when we did a call a few months back about a fund idea. I took note of everything you told me, but this stood out.<br><br>I think those who are new need to understand something. You must know your deal and you must be passionate because you believe in the deal.<br><br>There are deals located that you just know will never fly and you don&#39;t get passionate about and then there are deals that will surface that you just know are worth doing.<br><br>A guy on the call today was not prepared to talk about a deal. I think we all saw how that went down. Sal and AJ were very nice when others would not have been.<br><br>All the spreadsheet templates, the five data points and other tools you have at your disposal are for the purpose of crafting the presentation to investors and funders for your deal. It all starts with the five data points and evolves from there.<br><br>The five data points gives you a birds eye view of the deal. What is the significance of the current NOI? well the debt service payments come out of this and it shows where the properties financials are. What  is the stabilized or Pro Forma? This is going to show where the project can be financially over time.<br><br>What&#39;s the debt stack? Will adding new capital cause the property to be over leveraged? In other words, will new capital put the property in danger of not making debt service. Sources and uses, the story behind the deal, exit strategy.<br><br>You must know this, it&#39;s a huge part of knowing the deal. One thing you also have to understand is what is the best deal structure? meaning, does the project lend itself to a refi? will bringing in a JV partner be more appropriate?<br><br>The guy on the call was talking about a multi family in Fort Worth, Texas, 186 units, 80% occupancy and he mentioned Loop Net, also known as hospice for deals. Just because it&#39;s 186 units and 80% occupied does not mean anyone will jump at this deal.<br><br>Most investors will compare a deal like this to others in the market. They will look at what&#39;s available for sale, what is the class of the asset, meaning is it A, B or C. The biggest question will always be, do I spend $2,000,000.00 for 186 units at 80% occupancy and a class C property that needs rehab, new management, new signage, extensive advertising and marketing to get occupancy raised or do I invest $2,850,000.00 for 240 units in a class A property where it&#39;s pretty much turn key.<br><br>You must ask yourself, if I had the capital available whether it&#39;s through a combination of my own or a partners equity and a new first or whatever the capital stack is, would I buy this deal? you have to look past dollars and cents because pragmatically, the deal just may not be worth doing.<br><br>Just my two cents Sal.        </p>

I thought no, but you seemed to say yes.<br><br>2) Does DanDrew table fund?  If so, Just how wouold that work?        </p>

That means different things to different people. We can set this up if their monthly volume is $10mm per month and can show that they have had a history of doing that for at least 3 months at that volume. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>I noticed in the structured products and equity product posting today that there is Land listed as a asset type we can deal in.<br><br>Three questions. 1) do you have to be in a certain program to submit these deals. 2) are there any special details about land loans we need to be conscious of. 3) Does it matter whether the sponsor-operator wants to develop residential versus commercial or does it matter what the final asset class developed will be.        </p>

          Sal, I was just in conversation with an attorney (I cold called) regarding 3 commercial lots he presented me with... says 1 is in contract, 1 is under LOI to be contracted and the other has interested party but nothing in the works presently.  Says value is 17.725MM and Vulture fund is on his heals. He wants to get them off his heals.  I know that Dandrew is not into land, but is it worth digging deeper or simply pass on this one?        </p>

          Sal,<br>I wanted to update you on a call I had today. I spoke with a company that buys seconds from banks directly. They have been doing this full time since 2007.<br><br>They buy anywhere from 1000 to 10000 per month. Anything that does not fit into their portfolio, they will sell which is generally about 20 to 30% of the new inventory monthly. They work the files and hold in their own portfolio. They don&#39;t set junk aside and keep the best stuff, they simply liquidate what doesn&#39;t work for them.<br><br>They own the notes and they use a company in Virginia to house all the files and it&#39;s a fee for service situation with the holding house.<br><br>What I said to the CEO of the firm on the call is as follows:<br><br>We are backed by a large and successful fund that likes these types of opportunities and I am certain they would enjoy doing business over the long term. The pricing will be on a deal by deal basis. I have a follow up call on Monday of next week to fine tune the relationship.<br><br>They stated that they get opportunities to acquire first liens but since their entire business model focuses on seconds, they pass. I said we would have a interest in dealing with them on the firsts.<br><br>See you on the call.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Was wondering- is it possible to have more than one pref equity in cap stack? If so- who would get paid first? Are these recorded docs? I know they are not loans- but is payback in accordance with recordation? Might seem silly but was wondering this for a while. It seems to me there can only be one pref equity deal in stack but am not positive. Thanks!        </p>

          It is an excellent question. *Please ask this on the call*. <br><br>Larger deals, like skyscrapers in Manhattan, SF and Chicago can have Sr. Pref, Jr. Pref. Its just adding more buckets under the waterfall. <br><br>For deals less than 100mm, it doesn&#39;t exist. And these aren&#39;t recorded docs because as you know, Richard, being a Mezz vs. Pref professional like you are, you know that these aren&#39;t recorded (secured) docs. They are just collateralized by control and remedies in the LLC&#39;s Operating Agreement. <br><br>Sal<br><br>PS. Want to be a mezz vs. pref professional like Richard? Go here: <br>  <br>https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/saleform/nathniueo <br>Sal        </p>

          I receive lots of deals in regards to financing - refinancing, Is there a particular area you are concentrating on? If so, can I receive criteria or some place in our resources I may have overlooked. I have the private identity kit already;  just trying to weed out and narrow my marketing.  I receive deals financing of SFR, SFR Refinancing, Commercial Financing/Refinancing, SFR Construction, and Commercial Development.        </p>

          Great question:<br><br>Right now, the writer who puts all of the pieces together in a coherent format is working on our JGMellon.com site (AJ&#39;s). He became ill with an &quot;acute lodged bowel&quot; and he couldn&#39;t hold food and needed surgery. <br><br>Once he finishes that, he is moving onto the REO and Private Banker website content. He has everything he needs, but I have to depend on him to get this done. <br><br>Thanks<br>Sal        </p>

          Sal,<br>This article was published by the Mortgage Bankers Association on Tuesday. It seems that bankers are making loans to Commercial and Multifamily to the tune of $358 Billion in 2013. This seems like a significant increase in lending  which would suggest that lenders have relaxed their underwriting requirements.......or is this just a small percentage of market share going to the crem-de-la-crem sponsor ?<br><br>(Article from front page of the MBA website)<br><br>WASHINGTON, DC (April 8, 2014) – Commercial and multifamily mortgage bankers closed $358.5 billion of loans in 2013 according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) 2013 Commercial Real Estate/Multifamily Finance Annual Origination Volume Summation.<br><br>Commercial bank and savings institutions were the leading investor group for whom loans were originated in 2013, responsible for $100.5 billion of the total.  CMBS issuers saw the second highest volume, $79.8 billion, and were followed by life insurance companies and pension funds; Fannie Mae; REITS, mortgage REITS and investment funds; and Freddie Mac.<br><br>In terms of property types, multifamily properties saw the highest origination volume, $136.9 billion, followed by office buildings, retail properties, hotel/motel, industrial, and health care.  First liens accounted for 97 percent of the total dollar volume closed.<br><br>“Improving property markets and a strong appetite among lenders led to a very active year in commercial real estate finance,” said Jamie Woodwell, MBA’s Vice President of Commercial Real Estate Research.  “Multifamily rental properties drew the most financing, and banks and thrifts were the largest source of commercial real estate lending.  Despite the fact there are fewer maturing loans in need of refinancing this year, originations should continue to be buoyed by higher property values, rising property incomes and still low interest rates.”<br><br>Driven in part by increased coverage, the reported dollar volume of commercial and multifamily mortgages closed in 2013 was 47 percent higher than the volume reported in 2012.  Among repeat participants in the survey, the dollar volume of closed loans rose by 22 percent.         </p>

          Sal, in reading some of the posts here, I&#39;ve come to see that a lot if the members are new and trying bulk deals. I applaud everyone for being here and working to make it big.<br><br>I wanted to pass this on as a few tricks I use to determine if I&#39;m dealing with a untrained Intermediary and determining if they are as direct as they want me to believe.<br><br>First question I ask is, so your direct to the seller? Usual answer is yes.<br><br>Next question is, who is the seller? Usual answer is can&#39;t provide that right now and my question us, why not<br><br>My statement than becomes, okay, well are they an individual, family office looking to divest, bank, usual answer is cannot provide that right now.<br><br>Next question is, when can you? Usual answer is always something like, when you submit a LOI and POF.<br><br>Next question is? Letter of interest or Letter of Intent. There is a difference. Letter of Interest just says you are interested and under what terms you usually buy at, it&#39;s very vanilla in nature. Letter of intent spells out what terms you&#39;ll buy at and what price you would buy at if everything meets your needs.<br><br>Next statement is, if your direct to the seller than you have a agreement for compensation in place and usually they say yes.<br><br>My next statement than becomes, well if this is the case than even if I went around you direct, you would be protected anyway no matter what, because if your direct and your the only one who has this deal, than the seller, who you have an agreement with knows I got the deal direct from you.<br><br>At this point, I usually have outed them and their only thing to cling to is a POF and I say well since we have already concluded you are not direct than I&#39;m not sending you a POF, I will send it to the seller at the proper stage, where do I send it to and usually this is when they confirm they are not direct because they can&#39;t tell you who the seller is, they only know who they got the deal from.<br><br>My next question is how many points are you getting in the deal and usually they say something like its 50 or 40 plus 3. I then call them out again by saying ok, what are you doing that&#39;s worth three points? Usually I get any myriad of replies.<br><br>I lead the call, I ask pointed questions, I listen to the replies, I listen to the tones in the other persons voice, I listen for tells, which is what professional poker players do when they are sizing up their co-players.<br><br>From the call I can tell if I am dealing with a novice or a seasoned player, a Intermediary or even a direct seller. Yes, sometimes you will get a seller who is great as a buyer but terrible as a seller.<br><br>You have to qualify the deal and you have to begin by qualifying the parties in the deal. You must know who your working with. Sorry this is long winded.        </p>

          Sal is my pal. Listen. Talking to this one guy-( not bank) swears he is the seller of these notes but wants POF and LOI ahead of time. Hate to keep bringing it up but this guy found my site and all. I told him we absolutely do not do LOI or POF before we even know what we are buying. He stated that they need this because they do not want all this information sent out like before when buyers who were not really buyers- shopped it around and all this non sense.<br><br>I said we will will sign  CA and that should suffice and we handle the info with respect and all. Left it at that. He swears he is the seller.<br>Standing my ground though. Not biting on this. The man with the money makes the rules. lol!!!<br><br>Banks will be calling me soon and I am following up with them as well as starting to call HML&#39;S. Love this stuff.<br><br>Thanks for all you and staff do! <br><br>        </p>

          Richard, I&#39;m dealing with this too just yesterday and I called this guy out. Here is what I did. I asked Letter of Interest or Letter of Intent, he said LOI, I said letter that I&#39;m interested or that I plan to buy. He said plan to buy.<br><br>I said sorry, don&#39;t issue that until I see what were looking at. I said ok so if I give this to you, then I can have the tape in less than 5 minutes right, he said, no we have to vet you. I said hmmm interesting. I&#39;m showing you I want to buy and I have the money and you want to vet me. I said if your direct or your the seller, you should have the tape right in front of you or in your files.<br><br>I played dumb and said well what&#39;s vetting, he said qualifying you. I said, I thought LOI and POF did that. I said look pal, I can call any bank in this country, ask if they have any loans they want to move off their balance sheet and have the tape in 24 to 48 hours or even in 5 minutes from the end of the call and I won&#39;t have to provide a POF up front and maybe just have to sign a NDA.<br><br>I told him your not dealing with an amateur here but I am. I wished him luck and said next call.        </p>

          Sal,<br>I was going to email you about this deal, but I decided to post it here, because I really think this would be a good deal for others to learn from.<br><br>This is the Orlando, Florida deal I mentioned last week here. It is not a Bulk REO deal but rather a bulk property deal. Here is the breakdown of the numbers and specifics.<br><br>1) Portfolio consists of 43 Sfr&#39;s in Orlando, Sanford, Apopka, Daytona, Deland and Mount Dora. Property prices/values range between the $40k&#39;s and $166K. All professionally rehabbed.<br><br>2)  This is a all-deal no carve outs permitted. Seller ask is $3,100,000.00 but property prices are showing to be cumulative at $ 2, 673,000.00. Has received an offer at $2.7 M but I believe that to be a pricing tactic trick to generate an offer closer to ask. However, seller is flexible on offer.<br><br>3)  NOI is at $332,000.00 annually with the cap rate close to 11%. Monthly rents are below market at $27, 140.00.<br><br>4) Market rent is at $459,660.00 annually or $38,305.00 with a cap rate at market of 15% and allowing for a 5% vacancy.<br><br>The upside on this deal is that the rents are below market and once raised to market, will generate a monthly income increase of about $11,100.00. Orlando is a good market to be in and can be considered a Tier-1 City.<br><br>The properties have already been rehabbed professionally within last 12 to 36 months.<br><br>The downside to this deal is that the properties are not all at the $60K mini asset value. They are sfr&#39;s and produce 1 income stream as opposed to a multi family which has multiple income streams and if one tenant vacates, there is remaining income in place. The properties have already been rehabbed so from that perspective, there is no value add component so the value add would be in the immediate or near immediate increase of rents. <br><br>Is this a deal that Dandrew or Dave Gordon would have or share an interest in? Should I submit it? Any thoughts?        </p>

          James: <br><br>Great question. We&#39;re not (and no one I know of) is going to be a bid on this as there is a lot of *&quot;rougher product&quot;*, or *&quot;smaller balance&quot;* stuff on here that isn&#39;t desirable for institutions. <br><br>However, all is not lost though. At the event Dave Gordon will be talking about how to cross these with *individual retail investors*.<br><br>Individual rehab investors will buy these all day long. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal, what steps can I take to insure &#39;hope certificates&#39; become &#39;sure bets&#39;.  Not only am I structuring the financing (whether it&#39;s bridge financing or existing debt) I am the one who has found the opportunity as well as the one who&#39;s introducing it to a qualified sponsor/operator.  My intent is to play the role of a promoter in order to gain operator experience; rather than just being a capital provider, who collects passive interest.  I want to be involved more and have my compensation reflect that....how do I protect my interest as a promoter.<br><br>I sort of have my equiteer hat on...what warrants me asking to be on all levels of the capital structure (normal stack water fall that is - pref, promote, and debt) <br><br>Mainly, how do I structure the pref and promote to keep the sponsor interested and motivated.  Like I said I&#39;m bringing the deal and capital; it might seem to even ask for skin in the game from the sponsor to make it more of a commitment.<br><br>Thank you<br>Hurol        </p>

          Hurol! <br><br>Regarding this question: *“Sal, what steps can I take to insure ‘hope certificates’ become ‘sure bets’”*<br><br>Sal says: Simple. Make sure you have the best qualified operator who will bring the deal across the home plate. Does this guy have the grit and determination to bring it through? <br><br>*&quot;My intent is to play the role of a promoter in order to gain operator experience; rather than just being a capital provider, who collects passive interest.”*<br><br>Sal says: Absolutely! And that is what you *should* be doing! <br><br>*”Mainly, how do I structure the pref and promote to keep the sponsor interested and motivated.”*<br><br>Sal says: I think you need to make sure he’s bringing something to the table. Something of significance to him/her. That is how they stay motivated as they have skin in the game. Otherwise, they have to be in at such a low basis that they don’t want to lose the deal. <br><br>Sal<br>        </p>
