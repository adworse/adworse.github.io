          Sal, for my first hard money velocity fund, in your opinion, would it be too much style drift to include the acquisition of distressed and performing notes along with originating quick turn fix and flip loans? I like both businesses, and I&#39;ve seen hard money decks that had both investment strategies, but I&#39;m thinking it might be worth it to concentrate on one for my first offering.         </p>

          Sal, I am not having as much success (as I thought I would) raising capital from small retirement plans for my private mortgage pools. Is 10-12% and low risk not attractive anymore? Maybe I am asking for sex too early as you like to say. I&#39;ll keep plugging away but wanted to briefly vent! Waiting to get taken out of my loans successfully to finally approach some institutions! Thanks!        </p>

          The SEC finally approved Title III of the JOBS Act, ie.equity crowdfunding with non-accredited investors. On LinkeIn, Twitter and Facebook people are rejoicing like they just hit the lottery, I doubt if  any of them have even perused the 585-page document, let alone read it cover to cover and that screams to me there’s nothing simple about the SEC regulations in this matter. This is certainly not going to be easy money for anybody and I would imagine many are going to lose their life savings.<br><br>http://www.forbes.com/sites/chancebarnett/2015/10/30/sec-approves-title-iii-of-jobs-act-equity-crowdfunding-with-non-accredited/        </p>

          What are the issues we need to consider when a client wishes to mix tax advantaged retail money with institutional capital in a fund structure? <br><br>Some thoughts that come to mind when my client asked me this question: <br>- Will this reduce the pool of institutional investors that want to work with this fund?<br>- Will this require additional verbiage in the docs <br>- Should the fund manager ensure a &quot;cushion&quot; for retail tax advantaged investors to ensure they don&#39;t get diluted in the case of a capital call? <br>- What might the fund manager need to consider when it comes to documenting, reporting, etc tax advantaged retail capital?         </p>

          My simple answer to this is “church and state”. <br><br>You’ll have (and we’re doing this with JG Mellon) two classes of investors. One will be institutional, the other will be retail. <br><br>That is it. Two separate classes of shares. <br><br>However, at this point, if the institutional investment is large enough, do you need the retail investors? <br><br>*Most importantly, what is this fund doing I need more meat to chew on. What will the proceeds raise be used towards?*<br><br>Sal        </p>

          26 days ago seems like a long time ago. We&#39;ve covered a lot of ground in Miami this month. But if this came from one of my current clients, then it&#39;s either going to be used for buying stabilized multi-family or making hard money loans. <br><br>The idea of structuring two separate classes of shares makes sense. It doesn&#39;t tell me what protections or disclosures to put in place, but it does give a good idea how we might structure the risk away from our institutional investors. I presume a well formulated question to a syndication attorney might answer some of this, but I wouldn&#39;t expect them to tell me what rules of thumb to apply to wrap a safety net around retail tax-advantaged investors. Maybe requiring them to have .5x the amount invested in reserve? Or 1.5x the contributed amount? <br><br>You see where I&#39;m going with this, yes?         </p>

          *Retail Investors*: Why do you feel the need to put 50% of that raised in reserves? I don&#39;t really know what you&#39;re doing. These investors take the assumption of risk. You&#39;re coddling them way more than you need to and will hurt their returns ultimately.         </p>

          I can agree with that if we work from the assumption that retail investors are sophisticated enough to protect themselves. What about those clients who don&#39;t make that assumption and decide to insulate their funds against the aggravation of diluting their retail contributions and raising capital to take its place?         </p>

          The broker-dealers should/will shoulder this burden for us. We&#39;re doing that now with out JG Mellon fund that we&#39;ll be talking about after the consulting conference later this month with our Expert Network.         </p>

          Hey Sal,  is it possible to get JV equity potentially lined up before the property is under contract? A Sponsor has access to a property but without equity is reluctant to get deal under contract without a possible JV partner. I assume he could have an LOI signed that would afford him time to find a JV partner? I suggested raising capital for a fund structure to him as that may suit his needs best as he has several opportunities lined up. And I hope you plan to make the consulting bootcamp available to those of us who can not be there that weekend? Thanks!        </p>

          Nique, <br><br>Yes it is. This is very common and its called *“programmatic equity”*. This is essentially the capital partner and the operator getting together, agreeing on what will be purchased, and who will have discretion.  There have been a couple of continuing eds that talked about this. However, if you’re sponsor can fit these criteria *meaningfully*, then you have something to talk about: <br><br>1.  *Sponsor bios.* <br>Not company bios, the humans that make the magic happen<br><br>2.  *Sponsor deal sheet.*<br>What did they get in at, what did they get out at. Profit make. Simple. <br><br>3.  *Can clearly articulate strong deal sourcing ability.*<br>This is their secet sauce. How are they sourcing their deals? What’s their edge?<br><br>This is enough here to warrant a trip to 1st base. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          108 minute phone call w latest client today. These guys have paid me $5K for an asset level pitch deck, but climbing into their business model exposed the fact that they have limited experience and have a huge learning curve to get them into shape. I&#39;m thinking they are a good candidate for a monthly retainer-type relationship. They need vocabulary, discipline, structure, deal analysis, capital raising, etc. The works. They are coachable &amp; seem to be taking advice seriously. There is just no way that I&#39;d be introducing them to serious capital providers until they get a few things handled. <br><br>What do you think is a reasonable $ value and deliverable schedule to offer them? Considering the time I&#39;m investing, I think it fair that I be compensated. <br>        </p>

          Simply doing a single asset pitch deck for these guys. It&#39;s amazing what we learn when doing a simple pitch deck project for someone. Digging in, I discovered their strategy was flawed and their documents suggest that they don&#39;t really know what they want to be when they grow up. I really like this group of individuals. They&#39;ve taken steps towards infrastructure and discipline that sets them above the regular retail crowd, but wow do I see a lot of opportunities for improvement! There is no question in my mind that sharing what I know would help these guys. I just want the exchange to be fair.         </p>

          That will be more than fair. You need to charge them more so you don’t feel irritated talking to them and you’re happy to be taking their calls. You’re schooling them hard. <br><br>And they have no chance to be successful if you’re not there orchestrating the band to hum successfully together. <br><br>Didn’t you just see the Consulting Webinar we just did?

          One idea for an infographic: Lay out the typical income structure for an operator next to that of a fund manager on a page. <br><br>An operator is going to be thinking in terms of an acquisition fee, cash flow and equity splits at the asset level. Typically in very simple terms such as a straight 75/25 split. Whereas a fund manager is going to be thinking about both the asset AND the portfolio level and will include items like management fee, performance hurdles and incentives, etc. I find myself explaining this concept to clients who are attempting to evolve past the purely operator mentality. <br><br>Whether they want to be a fund manager themselves or simply want to interface with capital that is accustomed to working with fund managers, it would be helpful to familiarize our clients with the primary differences. <br><br>Check out this excerpt I got direct from a client this morning. It represents a paradigm some operators have when working with institutional capital: <br><br>&quot;The source of money for an individual purchase is just as important as the property selected. Institutional money however, does come with some strings attached. Many of the income streams that &lt;company&gt; depends on for its own survival are controlled or eliminated when using institutional money. Many times the acquisition fee is reduced or eliminated altogether. Their take of the income can also be great too, leaving little for the investors, and in some cases, their control can also be limiting preventing many of the changes we intend to make.<br>If they were to withdraw their interest after our earnest money has gone hard, this could be disastrous to our financial ability to attempt to purchase our next project.&quot;<br><br>In 75 minutes, I will be attempting to explain the fact that using institutional money provides different income opportunities. It doesn&#39;t mean death or cutting into profit. It can mean additional volume, more robust infrastructure, additional eyes on the market, a safety net, and some additional fees to pay for maturities in infrastructure. <br>        </p>

          I&#39;m not sure this would be a great fit for an infographic. Its smarter money and the terms are all different. <br><br>This guy likes the &quot;loosey-goosey&quot; retail money. Meaning it is generally unsophisticated and he can do what he pleases without answering to anyone. That means there&#39;s not smarter eyes on his project. <br><br>And I get that, but if he wants to build a leverageable brand for himself with the certainty of deeper pockets for other projects and be the next big time developer, he will have to entertain some insitutional money. <br><br>But here&#39;s what he&#39;s forgetting: *He can always downshift back into retail capital* later.  Meaning, he can leverage his experience with institutional back into the retail world again (like I&#39;m doing with JG Mellon...). <br><br>Sal         </p>

          That makes sense. That&#39;s valuable perspective I&#39;ll be incorporating into my dialog going forward. Thank you. <br>I&#39;d still like to see some examples of those smarter money terms so at the least I can demonstrate what is possible. <br><br>That said, while I&#39;ve clearly found a way to monetize a few unsophisticated pages in my Rolodex, I&#39;m starting to consider the sophisticated ones more carefully. Helping to move retail focused operators into the institutional space is fun, but it&#39;s also heavy lifting and those I am helping don&#39;t always have the financial strength to pay.         </p>

          Hello Sal<br>Ive been reading a lot of posts and am a bit confused. I have several clients that need Expansion Capital. They are not Hard Money Lenders. A capital raise seems very viable here but Ill wait to hear from you. I know this is a bit vague but It all falls under the Multi Family Arena. Can we do a Capital Raise for our clients under varying scenarios? Is there a Minimum Amount? What is total cost to them (the investor/sponsor)?<br>BTW ....I live in Colorado and I&#39;m seeing a lot of MMJ (Medical Marijuana) funding request coming across my desk. Is this something that we can fund if set up properly? <br><br>Thanks...<br>R...        </p>

          Ramon<br><br>I have no idea what “expansion capital” means. These terms mean different things to different people. We will only provide capital backed by real estate. What you’re asking for sounds like a signature loan at a bank that requires no collateral. <br><br>And no we will not do Medical Marijuana funding. No one is doing that now as its still illegal at the *federal* level. Meaning if you raise money, no banks will take your investment capital as its linked to this business. You are seeing these deals as they are all over the place, no one wants to touch them and only the fools and inexperienced mortgage brokers thing there is an opportunity here. <br><br>In fact, there isn’t. <br><br>So now this tells me someone is pulling the wool over your eyes by saying “expansion capital” for a business no one wants to touch. <br><br>So if the market won’t touch it, that’s telling you something. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Sal - do you have any clean examples of redemption plans that might be considered acceptable in the market today? <br>Client proposing a 1 year lock up with, will first pay off all obligations, then is then basically kicking them out of the fund - never to return - for asking for a redemption. Seems both simplistic and punitive to me.         </p>

          I&#39;m getting them ready for the show. There are a number of issues that I don&#39;t think they have a healthy paradigm for. Redemptions is one of them. Their opening position was &quot;We&#39;re not giving anyone their money back until we&#39;re done.&quot; My advice was to craft a provision and be ready in case redemption becomes reality. <br><br>Their amended position is that they will lock up capital for one year with no exceptions, then wind down expenses. I&#39;m nudging towards the idea of adopting a first come first served approach - one that allows them to find replacement capital and carry on without derailing anything, but provides best effort to their investors. I&#39;m hopeful that you might have something in writing that can serve as an example or two of redemption provisions in action. <br><br>I recognize that their attorney will craft the final actual provision. I&#39;m simply adjusting attitudes here.         </p>

          There are two sides to this. And this is an important point. Your client’s (fund manager’s) job is to deliver value to his investors. Morning, day and night. He doesn’t want to have to take his eye off the ball to deal with redemptions. No one does. The way to do this is to put a 2 year gate into that. <br><br>Remember, if these LP interests are sold in the secondary market, they will not get par pricing (meaning dollar invested). Sharks like me will pay probably less than 50% for those shares. So he needs to make sure his investors know that their investment – like in any other partnership – is *illiquid*.        </p>

          Several months back you wrote to me on this forum in reference to a client &quot;He can transfer these defaulted or slow-performing notes onto a “hospital facility” but that is a story for the conference in May. OK?&quot; I don&#39;t recall discussion in May about a &quot;hospital facility&quot; or any other facility you and I have kicked around. You were working on a continuing ed at the time as well. Just raising the question again as it&#39;s still relevant and I know you&#39;re busy &amp; may have inadvertently stepped over this one.         </p>

          Its been a very busy summer. Just this past week I was in California pitching and then nose surgery on Wednesday. <br><br>Does your client have anything that requires a hospital facility? Its really moving bad loans onto a new, more expensive credit line so it doesn&#39;t violate the covenants of the first line of credit. If there are bad loans made on that line, that may prohibit the lender from making any additional loans until those scratched and dented have been cleared from that line. <br><br>Enter in the hospital facility at higher terms. And I can assure you that Dave Gordon will be discussing this at his workshop in September. <br><br>Does this make sense? If you need a hospital facility, get in contact with Gordon. As an Expert Network member, you can access him easily.         </p>

          Perfect explanation. Thank you. <br><br>I don&#39;t need one. I was scrubbing through AskDandrew looking for an answer to another question and realized we never closed the loop. I was looking forward to the facility discussion in May. <br><br>I will offer  - if it works for you and you can provide the content (or access to someone who knows this stuff) - to craft a table that shows the various facilities, general guidelines, and descriptions for each type of facility. For example:<br><br>A Credit facility is... it&#39;s used for... structure... terms rule of thumb... sources... special considerations<br>A Rediscount facility is... It&#39;s used for...structure... terms rule of thumb... sources... special considerations<br>A Hospital facility is... It&#39;s used for... structure... terms rule of thumb... sources... special considerations<br><br>Probably a good tool for the consultant toolbox. You can distribute to your other students who are working at that level. <br><br>I did this private video early in the year as an explanation of rediscount facilities for my client after our last talk: http://rch.evsuite.com/how-a-rediscount-facility-works/  It&#39;s raw, but it wasn&#39;t meant for public consumption.         </p>

          Using the 10 yr treasury rate makes this work easy. Thanks!<br>Is it safe to assume that each capital provider and/or traditional bank will calculate spread as a function of proprietary internal formulas, or is this something we can do on our own using rules of thumb and knowledge of given market conditions? <br>I&#39;ve been backing out spread by simply subtracting the base rate.         </p>

          &quot;Significant Equity Play&quot; is a concept that needs more specificity. A given investment needs to move the needle some number of points in a positive direction before an institutional investor will consider it &quot;significant.&quot; Recognizing that this concept is relative and that different investors will define &quot;significant&quot; in different ways, what do you think a good rule of thumb and measure might be? <br><br>Some examples might be: <br>- a 1% change in cap rate from a 5cap to a 4cap. <br>- A R.O.E. of 15% in 4 months. <br><br>Can you help me put some specificity around this concept? <br>        </p>

          I&#39;d like to get a list together of expected (lowest common denominator) data points / reports that institutional investors expect to see from fund managers and in what time frame. For example, I assume fund managers will report fund level IRR and perhaps asset level IRR on some regular basis. <br><br>What else will they report? What are the reports and what is the expected time frame for each? <br><br>Should fund managers use a data room service for this? One of my clients is building his own information system to report to his investors. He&#39;s asking me for what data fields / reports should be included.         </p>

          This particular fellow has been dissatisfied with the stock systems he&#39;s experienced out there. Says his business model isn&#39;t unique, but he wants to cover more of his process with automation. He&#39;s paying someone to developer his IT. I think it&#39;s influence from his son, who is an IT guy. I think he wants his son to be a part of his succession plan. May be some family politics. <br><br>That said, any idea where I might find standards for reporting to LP&#39;s?        </p>

          At the risk of crossing replies with you, I tracked down some reporting / compliance resources that the Dandrew community might find useful - in case we ever find ourselves being asked about reporting and compliance in the future. These are three of my favorites:<br><br>ILPA Standardized Reporting Templates: http://bit.ly/1S7krFq<br>NCREIF Reporting Standards Volume I: http://bit.ly/1B8xbaa<br>NCREIF Reporting Standards Volume II: http://bit.ly/1KYU8Nx<br><br>I sent these three to my client and instructed him to coordinate with his accountant to determine which of these standards are most appropriate for the business model he&#39;s trying to establish.         </p>

          I was going to say INREV as well. Good work and thanks for sharing. <br><br>However, this is not what he paid you for, correct? We like to use EisnerAmper for our funds, however, something this small a regular K-1 accountant can do the work for them. Again, if he has 3 investors, this is overkill and probably trying to make his son feel relevant. <br><br>It is very uncanny though that mostly software developers, IT guy and gals all decide to be come hard money lenders... <br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal - this opens an interesting line of thought for me. These clients are paying me for two things: 1. to craft a pitch book and 2. to introduce them to capital. The challenge is that I can&#39;t (or don&#39;t want to) introduce them to strong capital providers unless they are strong themselves. I don&#39;t want to earn a reputation as introducing neophytes that can&#39;t play the game. So, I see the holes and try to fill them. I want their foundation strong and their pitch book to reflect that. Handing a client a super pitch book when I know there is nothing behind it, then sending them into meetings seems destructive. <br><br>How do you propose we handle these situations when we find them?         </p>

          Comment from a new customer: &quot;Do you have an example of a tear sheet and pitch book that we could pattern ours after?&quot; <br><br>I told them I would not even try to raise capital for them unless they had a tear sheet and pitch book. <br><br>He has a stabilized single asset in need of renovation with a $9MM loan from Arbor that needs $5MM in equity. Of course, I think I should be doing his single asset pitch book for him and don&#39;t want to give away IP free of charge. How would you respond to such a statement?         </p>

          Tell him you do after the check clears. <br><br>Use the consulting agreement and engagement letter and show him the model. The pitchbook shouldn&#39;t be given away for free. They will struggle with the model and then come to you for help out of frustration.         </p>

          FYI: I didn&#39;t need to send them the model. They just called and will be cutting me a check for a single asset pitch book ASAP. I explained that whether they are successful with this raise or not, they will have an evergreen fundraising tool for their tool box. <br><br>This project is to syndicate $5MM of equity for a $14MM stabilized (91% occupied) C+ multi-family project in a C+ neighborhood in North Charleston, SC (the good section West of 26). This could be played as a Core or a Core-Plus, but they are playing it as a value-add / opportunistic deal. Their concept needs more investigation. <br><br>As is:<br>- $14MM purchase price under contract at a 5 cap<br>- Current NOI: $738,000<br>- Proforma NOI: $940,000<br>- Arbor brought them the deal and will be in first position for $9.1MM (65% LTV). The sponsor has a few hundred K into the deal in the form of deposits, etc (minimal / weak). They want to use the money for acquisition and renovation. <br><br>Their strategy depends on three things: 1. organic rent increases (weak play, but they are 2% below the area in occupancy and $40-$175 below monthly rental rates for the area) 2. upgrading 50% of the units (increasing rent) and 3. recent local government commitment to opening a new entrance to the airport, the Panama Canal expansion (a source for ship traffic up the Ashley river), and a 2.3% employment growth in the city since 2011. Their strategy is to renovate 139 of the 280 (50%) of the units and increase the rent by $125 / month on these units. It remains to be seen if they can do this, but they claim there are two key members on their management team who have proven track records with this kind of repositioning. I am collecting their deal book and management bios &amp; intend to probe deeper. I have not heard them mention carrying costs for the downed units while under construction, for example. <br><br>My cynicism has me focused on their key events, their management team, and the wisdom of trying to reposition a C+ multi-family in a C+ neighborhood. It might be in an area along a newly defined path of progress - in which case, it might work, but we have some homework to do. I am told their team has a lengthy deal book that proves the concept has been executed by this team in other geographies in the past. <br><br>In any case, I will get a single asset pitch book fee and they get an evergreen fund raising tool for their tool box. <br>Good trade.         </p>

          I doubt he understands promote, which is one reason I&#39;m fishing for your thoughts on how to respond to him. His current investors enjoy (interest on their contribution + points) - his fee which is typically 2% for each loan he makes. <br><br>I&#39;m planning to suggest that he take 1.5% of commitments and carry on a whole fund basis, a 20 after a 9 with a 2% fund manager contribution (to maintain alignment of interest) and 0 transaction fees. Assuming $15MM fund and .7% fund formation costs. <br><br>I suspect I&#39;ll be doing some training on fund level performance vs asset level performance.         </p>

          Yes. I agree that is the appropriate way to do this as equity. What he is doing is the debt (old fashioned) way. Not bad, just the risk is more acute on a per loan basis. <br><br>And I would charge him *$25,000* *minimum*, and *outline the boundaries of the relationship*. <br>Otherwise you&#39;ll feel that you could have made just as much money flipping burgers at Burger King... Use my agreement. Email me for that. <br>        </p>

          Client&#39;s response to what their fund&#39;s preferred return and promote will be: &quot;Not Applicable. Need to discuss necessity for prospective institutional or private money.&quot; I&#39;m assuming he wants to know what is good and customary for the market he&#39;s targeting. <br><br>His offering, BTW, includes making loans to value-add NOO single family home projects where the average loan value is $254k. He&#39;s holding them for an average of 182 days. His average return for the past three years has been 16% - which equals a combination of interest rate + points. <br><br>What might I suggest to him is a good number for his pitch book for preferred return and his promote?         </p>

          Mark<br><br>This is strong. I like this. <br><br>I would remove &quot;Travel Agent&quot;. You are not a travel agent. Find a friend who is a travel agent and have them give you referral fees for your clients. <br><br>Now, with that said, that could spook some guys.

          Thank you...even this little bit will help bring me closer to closing these guys...&quot;Travel Agent&quot; deleted. Completely understood.<br><br>Here is a very rough draft of what I have on pg 1: http://j.mp/TrisourceCapitalAdvisors<br><br>I wanted to do a pg 2 &quot;About&quot; section - What is your feeling on us riding your coattails a bit on this, to build some credibility, if we keep your name out of it? <br><br>I was thinking something like:<br><br>Trisource Capital is an intermediary to a principal, institutional funding source and former Wall Street investment banker who acts as manager for two active commercial real estate funds. Fund manager spent five years with a major Wall Street investment bank before breaking off and founding his own boutique capital advisory firm. Among other services, one current area of focus is on the raising of capital through institutional sources; alternative-asset hedge funds, family offices, smaller pension funds and also some high net worth individuals, including SDIRA investors. <br><br>As intermediaries to the funds, Trisource Capital receives exclusive, in-depth training, as well as inclusion in mentoring programs for investment banking and commercial real estate. Along with direct access to originating commercial bridge loans and institutional funds for the purchase of non-performing mortgage assets, Trisource Capital is launching a pilot program as capital formation consultants for select clients, under the personal guidance of fund manager. This is in response to a very real need of real estate investors, operators and sponsors looking to expand their businesses and create funds aligned with their business plans.<br><br>Let me know if that won&#39;t work.<br><br>I have the book.<br><br>I&#39;ll be in Vegas.        </p>

          Yes, that&#39;s a great idea, will post to Elance today and get it cleaned up. And with the single sentence above we won&#39;t need a second page - I&#39;ll place it on the first. There&#39;s no rush on getting it out so we can tweak next week if it comes up.         </p>

          Hi Sal, <br><br>We didn&#39;t get a chance to work on this or the Luxury Home Velocity Fund I&#39;m working on, but there was such great info at the workshop, I&#39;m very glad I went so thanks. Looking forward to any tapes of the event being released, as I know we had to move through some material quickly at some points.<br><br>Inspired, I started work on the next iteration of this info-doc..I added a page 2 with some info on pitchbook creation:<br>http://j.mp/TriSourceCapitalAdvisors<br><br>This hasn&#39;t been proofed yet and I will outsource proofing before releasing it..        </p>

          Client seeking capital is servicing his own loans. I think he likes it! Will he get more traction with capital providers if he hires a servicer like FCI or Evergreen? <br><br>What BPO firms would you suggest he use?         </p>

          So here’s where cynical Sal comes in. <br><br>I’m giving my money to a guy that like servicing? Well, he’s in the wrong business if he’s a lender. What he likes is the stable fees it brings in. <br><br>*Speaking from experience*, because that&#39;s all I can really state here, is that those who do their own servicing usually aren’t very good as deal sourcing rainmakers. Or raising capital. He’s managing the minutiae that pulls from his *2 jobs: finding deals and funding deals*.<br><br>I think it would show to his investors he is professionally mature and not the proverbial “chef, cook and bottlewasher”. <br><br>Let me profile this guy, he used to work in technology or something that make him very busy? So he feels productive most when doing the “busy” work and not the revenue generating work. <br><br>Clear Capital is a good BPO firm<br><br>Just a guess.         </p>

          I&#39;m acting the role of coach with him here. What you said about having him NOT servicing his own loans is where I&#39;ve been leading him. I think it&#39;s a matter of volume. With 30 loans and very carefully screened borrowers, it&#39;s been easy for him to service them. <br><br>His background is in sales / insurance. Always been a commission kind of guy. He does seem to like to do as much as he can though. You nailed that part. He takes great pride in the depth of his due diligence on his borrowers - which is pretty deep! <br><br>Thanks for the point towards Clear Capital!        </p>

          Sal is my Pal.... Just finished your book R.E. FUNDS UNCOVERED..... I will have to read it several more times but it is very interesting and very well written.<br><br>I have tons of questions but     I think I should wait till the website is up but can&#39;t resist asking you just 1 for now.  <br><br>I do want to know how the price per share is evaluated......I know it depends on asset price in the fund- but could you give example? Thanks so much and thanks for the book! VERY interesting....... Will start it again tomorrow. Crazy Cousin Richard        </p>

          So here&#39;s a point worthy of some discussion: As you know, I have a client who has paid me $25k to create a pitch book for him and introduce him to institutional capital. His goal is to leverage his current deal flow to deploy $15mm - $12mm above the $3.2mm he currently has deployed. <br>Judging from his responses to the workbook, he is not ready. He is missing critical ingredients in almost every area. <br>My job has transformed from creating pitch book, to coaching him to be ready to craft a pitch book, THEN craft a pitch book, then introduce him to capital. I find myself having to shift fundamental paradigms; manage expectations, teach vocabulary and concepts; and in some areas, teach him his own business (like how to build a complete file). This guy is getting his $25k worth!<br>I don&#39;t mind doing this as it is inspiring me to create online course material around certain subjects that I will use over and over again, and it is forcing me to deep dive into details that I now have to teach, but it would be so much easier to service clients that simply needed a pitch book and capital introduction.         </p>

          I am sincerely looking forward to the &quot;get them up to speed&quot; part of the formula. There is no question in my mind that there is a demand for this service. I am working my way through the process of getting my clients up to speed with heavy supplementation from your two books, multiple $600+ books from PEI, Prequin, NCREIF, etc. <br><br>I found the &quot;sizing&quot; part is pretty easy to figure out once they start writing, but there is a lot of ground to cover sometimes. Definitely worthy of a fee. <br><br>The second thing I noticed as I dance around with another prospect claiming to be interested in a single asset pitch book, is that there&#39;s a line that should not be crossed. This guy is back and forth with me about individual terms of the agreement, but is clearly using our back and forth as a learning experience. I cut him off today - put him on ignore for a while. <br><br>In a typical exchange, he asks me a question that I know the answer to, but it takes me a bloody hour to respond (educate him). The next email he gets from me will come in a few days (after he pulses me again) that essentially says either pay me or stop draining my energy. <br><br>I think I just need a &quot;get them up to speed&quot; plan that I can plug these guys into when they show up. If they need that kind of help, then they pay a retainer as you suggest - else I set up an education system like the one you have through Dandrew media and shovel out content as needed.         </p>

          They, they will be schooling off of you hard, but just say that you&#39;ve got paying clients to work with and can&#39;t school him all day. <br><br>That&#39;s why you need a VA overseas or your wife to field these calls for you. <br><br>Radio silence will work wonders for you. He&#39;s not going anywhere else. Then when he does get you, tell/ask him bluntly *&quot;look, I&#39;m used to working with more experienced sponsors. You seem like a nice guy, are you ready to commit because I can&#39;t hold hands all day. When will I get the agreement and the retainer back if I send it to you today?&quot;*        </p>

          Can you give us some detail around &quot;customary governance rights?&quot; <br>In one of your sample pitch books, you mention &quot;customary governance rights.&quot; The actual sentence reads: &quot;Generally minority stakes (5% to 25%) with customary governance rights,&quot; and is found in the Deal Structure subsection of the Investment Strategy.        </p>

          When a client mentions a name in a pitch book, it needs a bio, yes? What if they mention a name of an attorney or accountant when they are using an outside firm? I&#39;m going to assume they should simply use the name of the firm, and leave the names out; unless the name of the firm = the name of the person; or if the person has some material interest in the fund or is in partnership with the new fund manager. Am I close?        </p>

          Two deeper questions regarding a rediscount facility: <br><br>1. What becomes the cost of capital (on average) to the hard money lender who accepts this arrangement with an institutional capital provider? How much will an institutional capital provider charge (on average) to take the first 50% LTV position?<br><br>2. Will the hard money lender have to renegotiate relationships with his current private money lenders since the amount of total private capital will diminish (on a per deal basis), and yield on total capital deployed will change? <br><br>3. What impact on the hard money lender (and his private money sources)  is to be expected? <br><br>The reason for my questions: <br>I realize that in a re-discount facility arrangement, the manager still keeps points on the full amount loaned to (65% LTV), but I assume he will realize a lower spread on the capital provided by the institutional capital provider (50% LTV) on a deal by deal basis. <br><br>His private money sources currently provide 65% LTV on a deal by deal basis today. These same private money sources will ideally provide his contribution (15% LTV) to each deal after the rediscount facility is in place. <br><br>I&#39;m prepared to tell him that one way to keep the yeild to his private money sources constant is by making up the difference in sheer volume of additional loans to keep them happy. That means he will truly need to be confident that he can make 3 times more loans than he&#39;s making today in order for his rediscount facility to work. <br><br>Fortunately, deploying 3 times more loans is what he&#39;s looking to do. <br><br>What am In missing?        </p>

          Dave: <br><br>1. This is based on the collateral of what he will be lending on. What happens first is that the lender will review what this person has lend on, and how good he is at getting repaid back on his loans. Do his borrowers cash him out? Or is he constantly trying to extend and pretend that the loan will get paid off. *The tape is the soul of his business; it tells you what they are lending on, who they are lending to and how often they are churning money. It doesn’t lie.*  <br><br>Then the lender will draw a box and say this is what you can lend on and anything outside of this we won’t co-fund. <br><br>Fees and rates are usual, however, there could be some tricky fees such as if he doesn’t draw it down. <br><br>Lastly, a good rate range would be between a 7 – 9 handle. <br><br>2. Not really. The will be making more with less money in the deal. So the math for this can be done for this using the VigMaker Pro (which you have access to as a Placement Agent). It will show the pass-through spread between what the rehabber is paying through to the borrower. <br><br>(On a pool basis, the tool for this is  Private Mortgage Pool Financial Modeler™ Debt Model https://dandrew.infusionsoft.com/app/storeFront/showProductDetail?productId=418 – considering you’re a Placement Agent, you can get this by lobbing a ticket into the DandrewHelpDesk.com.) You need to play with this. <br>So now you’re asking what the hook is, right? Leverage will amplify the returns, the fund manager will get more points on less equity invested, and the private lenders or LPs will get more juice per loan because of the leverage. <br><br>The downside is that the equity is pledged as collateral as it is in the first loss position. What does that mean? It means if there is a loan at 65,000 made, the fund manager deploys 15,000 from his private lenders and the rest comes from the facility. <br><br>If something happens, where the asset is foreclosed on or sold for less than the 65,000, his equity is the first to get hit. Meaning if he sells for 55,000, then he lost 10,000 of his investor’s money. <br><br>Also, if he isn’t servicing these, or they’re not paying, he has to make the payments even though he’s not getting all of the payments. So make sure he saves his points into a slush fund as a management fee doesn’t customarily cover that. He can’t say “5% management fee as I have to pay for crappy loans…”<br><br>Now, what else can he do? He can transfer these defaulted or slow-performing notes onto a “hospital facility” but that is a story for the conference in May. OK? <br><br>I think this answers your question. I we have a continuing ed planned out to discuss all of these and we will once things calm down for me and I’m back in the LV office. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          &quot;What are ya going to do, Jack?&quot; <br>Last night, I took a call that made me recall those wonderful scenes from the movie Speed. In the movie, the antagonist, played by Dennis Hopper, puts our hero, Jack, played by Keanu Reeves, into impossible situations and taunts him.<br>&quot;What are ya going to do now, Jack. Huh? What are you going to do?&quot;<br><br>I want to doing something cool like shoot the victim in the leg. It hurts him like hell, but gets the job done and confuses the bad guy. Everyone goes home happy. <br><br>In this case, the bad guy was a money raising wanna-be. His contribution to &quot;the deal&quot; was to raise $1.7mm in equity. He raised zero, and didn&#39;t tell anyone until the last minute. Our hero, the buyer, did all the work putting the deal together, but made the mistake of taking his eyes off the money raising wanna-be partner. <br><br>This 80% seller financed deal is stabilized, has a few cool value plays, and might make a nice project for the right person or group. The contract is in place, buyers money is hard, and Monday represents another extension (and associated fee).  Our buyer is scrambling to see if there is a way out of his predicament. He called me. <br><br>I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s not much we can do here to save this guy&#39;s project, but I would like to hear from my pal Sal, or anyone else who is dealing with this sort of thing, what are some best practices for dealsing with these guys. Part of me says &quot;opportunity!&quot;  The other part says &quot;lost cause.&quot; <br><br>Cash at the ready could negotiate a strong position in this deal. Ownership interests are up for grabs as they booted the wanna-be. The DSCR is 2.29 at it&#39;s lowest point. The hold period is 2-5 years. <br><br>I&#39;m assuming this sort of thing might grab the interest of someone in a liquid position looking for a steady coupon. <br><br>What are your thoughts for dealing with deals on fire?         </p>

          Dave,<br><br>Just as the sun will rise, so will these opportunities come across your desk by people who do nothing expecting everything. <br>*Sal’s Rule #79: A lack of preparation on your behalf doesn’t constitute an emergency on my behalf.*<br><br>Here’s what I think, this deal may not be as hot as you think. Here’s why: if this guy couldn’t follow up with his “partner”, what makes you think he knows or has the aptitude as far as valuing this deal? Have you valued this deal yet using the 5 Data Points? <br>If it is a grand slam, then there is equity available for these, provided that you tell us what type of asset this is. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          I ended up suggesting a capital stack inversion. It happens that I was chatting with Naedo that day and she asked if the seller would be willing to take back a second instead of a first. That set the wheels in motion and I thought: if he could get the seller to take up position higher in the capital stack, he might be able to get some cash out at closing and the sponsor might have an easier time raising capital. <br><br>I offered two solutions. One with seller taking back 50% (after a $2mm, 50% LTV debt loan) followed by a sponsor contribution of $800k CAPEX. I also offered a second solution in case the seller pushes back at going above the 80% LTV mark: to tranche the sellers take back into 30% at the 6% already agreed upon rate, and a second 20% at an 8% pref. <br><br>Here&#39;s an image of the solutions: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/sh/128fc177-ec3b-42fb-a3cf-1eddeb713ebc/92945de8382c5b4e6f87ad20608d3fe5<br><br>This guy&#39;s deal may be poop. I sincerely doubt that he has the moxie to double down on his earnest money and take it to serious investors. I also knew that it would never make it past the deal desk with such a short fuse.<br><br>He did get a taste of how creative structuring and/or real fundraising might be able to help his business - which is what I wa going for.          </p>

          This is brilliant. And much of what we&#39;ll be discussing May 28-30. <br><br>I like Option 2. <br><br>Remember, that real estate&#39;s primary benefit or burden is that it has a human element to it. This is what makes it inefficient. Stocks and bonds don&#39;t have a human element to it, but they are very efficiently priced. <br><br>So you&#39;re comment regarding this guys moxie is dead on. That is why deals fail. And how winners are created.         </p>

          Can you describe the essential characteristics, similarities and differences between a credit facility, a rediscount facility, and equity facility, and any other facility type I might not be asking about? <br><br>It would help a great deal to provide the menu of options to clients when they come seeking funding options. Many are simply not ready for a fund, but think they are. We&#39;d like to offer a stepping stone approach.        </p>

          Sal is my Pal! Hope you are well. Just watching F.F. video and in the intro to that you speak of seller financing with B.D. in a neighborhood in Vegas that you knew of. My question is that this was before the DODD FRANK ACT. So if that is the case how did this act affect this edge that you and Bob had and how does this act affect anything you have come in contact with lately?? Do you see major changes with investors now doing owner financing???? Thanks Sal. Waiting on my autographed book!!  Crazy Cousin Richard        </p>

          Here&#39;s the reminder you asked me to post here during today&#39;s call: we&#39;re grateful for your offer to produce &quot;a crayon diagram of the transactional lifecycle.&quot; Context of our discussion today was pitch book formation. Client has existing hard money business and is distributing a little less than $5mm into SFR. The participants are his business, the capital provider (likely cultivated through Prequin) and the borrower / operator. We talked briefly through how we can tee this discussion up properly for LP&#39;s GP&#39;s. The crayon diagram you offered is a tool to help with that.         </p>

          Dave, <br><br>People used to make fun of my markers in the office. Now they are unemployed. Anyway, let’s chop some wood here. Of course you’d make me do infographics on a Saturday night. But since *you got the $25,000 cash in hand*, I think this merits rolling up our sleeves. <br><br>The attachment here will expire in 14 days. After that, I don’t know where it goes and it can be purchased I’m sure on DandrewMedia.com by then. <br><br>*https://www.hightail.com/download/UlRRa0ZUMGM5RmE1aWNUQw*<br><br>This schematic breaks out a hypothetical $100,000 hard money loan, where the Institutional money comes in and how they are protected when the asset is sold for less than 65,000. It shows who gets hurt, and who doesn’t get hurt. <br><br>This should be placed into the Pitchbook. Hire folks on Fiverr.com to make this slide for you. You may want to tweak this a little.<br><br>Sal        </p>

          This is effective, Sal. I don&#39;t care if it was literally on a napkin. I&#39;ve exchanged my share of napkin diagrams in the past and I am no genius with design either. When I get this one done by an actual graphics person, I&#39;ll send you a copy to do with as you see fit.<br><br>Here&#39;s what comes to mind: is the source of his (the hard money lender) current funds a concern that we should address with institutions? This client has pulled together about $5mm from mom and pop money. He&#39;s deployed most of it and would probably like to continue doing this in order to cover his newly leveraged 15%. <br><br>Might institutions be reluctant to invest alongside mom and pop funds?        </p>

          Early stages of working with a new client who needs a pitch book and ongoing capital. This client writes: <br><br>&quot;Do we have to engage you in order to get assistance and/or a template for a pitch book? If so, does the engagement letter price out that assistance (I have not seen it).&quot;<br><br>My draft response looks something like this: <br><br>&quot;The engagement letter spells out the terms for introducing XYZ to capital. We have a fee – flexible in the way is gets paid. Sometimes it’s all up front, sometimes it’s split and comes in part on the back end. Obviously up front ends up being less expensive. <br><br>We require a retainer to help with crafting your pitch book, working with you guys to get you ready, and making introductions. That covers the proprietary structure, financial modeling, graphics support, professional proof reading and edits, etc. XYZTrue Data pays for any travel &amp; other expenses, if required. <br><br>Our retainer is $25k. The fees in the engagement letter ranger from 1% (simple debt) to 5% of preferred equity provided to your company. <br><br>What are your thoughts around getting started?&quot;<br><br>Help me tweak this response?         </p>

          Dave  <br><br>This is a not-so-decent start. Let me trigger some action from them. Copy and paste what I have in bold. Remember, gamesmanship!<br><br>*Most of our clients already have a professionally placed deck ready for us to use. If you don’t have one, it is expected that you craft one. Otherwise we’re not going to be able to work with you. <br><br>However, this is a double-edged sword as if it doesn’t communicate the thesis appropriately, you will probably not get very far as most of these institutions have staff at the support level to weed out the flakes. <br><br>This deck requires you’re knowledge of the market, the asset and to be able to look at these numbers dispassionately. It’s more of an art than a science. We have a team of 2 analysts here that can do this for you. This includes the excel modeling and you’ll need to fill out our Pitchbook Workbook so we can craft and formulate your pitch for you. <br><br>The cost is $25,000 on this and we can turn this around inside of 3 weeks. Payment is due before we start work and I can send you wiring instructions for this. <br><br>The rights to the content is yours, and most clients use this as an evergreen marketing piece for future raises. <br><br>This is also critical as this is what is going to drive the language in the docs when we go to paper the deal. The atty’s will need something to base the transactional lifecycle off of this. <br><br>It’s a core competency and aptitude yard stick for sponsors in a market getting crowded…<br><br>Do you want me to add this language to the engagement letter before you execute?*         </p>

          Sal, lets say I raise capital for a $5M fund with a 70 after an 8 for the investors and one investor invested $3M and a second invested $2M. How do you give both of them a 70? Isn&#39;t it a 70 of the profits? I noticed that in the AJ NNN fund and was curious how exactly do you handle it with multiple investors of differing amounts? Thanks!        </p>

          Nique<br><br>Great question. <br><br>Its pro-rata. So its 70 for each dollar. If you put in 3mm, you get 70% of 3mm. Its something we talk about in the Private Equiteer platform called Fund Structures vs JV Equity.  <br><br>Now, some of these funds are very complicated as you’re dealing with sophisticated investors in the institutional world. Let’s pretend you are flying to Las Vegas. On your flight, no one person paid the same amount, right? <br><br>Sometimes institutions work the same. *Institutions*.<br><br>Not individual retail investors. *Small money has no voice.* <br><br>So if for example, Warren Buffett invested in my fund, he’d probably want 0 after a 0. Meaning, he would get all profits and I wouldn’t get anything from his investment slug. <br><br>But, the flipside is that money dogpiles onto other smart money much faster and I would scream from the mountain tops that Warren Buffet was an investor and I would benefit from that with also better economics from investors. Make sense? These are usually value-added deals or opportunistic funds. <br><br>Now, AJ’s is a NNN *stabilized* fund. Meaning steady, Eddie coupons. <br><br>There is no upside really, just a coupon. Like a bond. <br><br>And we’ve structured it into the docs that everyone gets the same on a pro-rata share. Ask me tomorrow on the call if you have any problems. <br><br>Make sense? <br>Sal         </p>

          Emerging Fund Manager screening question: What indicators / checklist should we use to determine if a person or team who SAYS they want a fund, are truly READY for a fund. What are some of your suggestions for keeping ourselves from working with amateurs / wasting our time? <br><br>Context: 20/20 hindsight is slapping me around today. I am working with a small group of professionals (a CPA, an Entrepreneur, a real estate broker type, the CEO of a mid-sized company, and a few others) with no deal book of their own who are looking to start a fund. They&#39;ve signed my engagement letter but paid me nothing (we have a verbal agreement to pay me in hope certificates). I know... and I won&#39;t be doing that again any time soon. <br><br>Assume this client claims to want to form a $250mm fund and has filed a PPM, but has little to no specificity in their filing (I have since discovered that it was filed without the benefit of an attorney - it&#39;s weak!). It is clear to me that this team of people knows nothing about portfolio theory, doesn&#39;t understand the math behind their own business model, and doesn&#39;t appear to have what I would consider a healthy focus on the welfare of their potential capital providers. I am losing hope that I will be able to take them to the big show. <br><br>I helped them word smith their documents. Now they call and email me more than any other client - nights, weekends... I stopped taking their calls without an appointment. <br><br>They are proving themselves to be a resource drain beyond what I feel they have a right to ask me for. Experience NOW tells me that had I had a proper screening process in the beginning, I would have probably spent my time elsewhere - or put them on a drip education program until they were ready for the big show. (Something I am considering now). <br><br>Frustrated, but adapting.         </p>

          Jeez Dave... This makes me cranky just seeing this. <br><br>anyone can say that they want $250mm. Tell them this has taken more time than you signed up for and that you&#39;re going to need to focus on other things for the foreseeable future. <br><br>Just get the hell out. You won&#39;t make any money. <br><br>*And remember, the biggest qualifier is $$$ upfront. You should be beyond the point of feeling flattered now for being an expert.

          Sal is my pal. Good day to you. Watching your videos on F.F. Question about &quot; MY EDGE&quot;. If I do not have any experience doing any raises or have been out of the real estate game for a bit- - can my edge be my intellectual capital- so to speak through training that you give? Also can I not now be a sponsor of a deal because I do have specialized knowledge? After all- we all need to start somewhere....... For example- I am looking at a 72 unit mf now here in my state. Negotiating the price down to where I need it to be with good upside. I can be the sponsor of this deal and do a deck or a raise for the funds to get in the deal- debt and equity- great property management team, etc. I feel I could be the sponsor on this deal even without experience running a 72 unit but have knowledge to get it done through utilizing or delegating responsibilities to experts in their field. Thoughts?        </p>

          In one of the videos of one of the student&#39;s deck who is trying to raise capital for a hard money fund has the management fees as 2% on committed capital and 10% incentive (promote) fees. So if you lend out $100,000 at 15% and 5 points, and the target return for the investor is 8% does that mean the investor gets $8000 (assume yearly) then the remaining profits, spread of interest (15%- 8%) plus the 5 points, is split 90/10? Thanks!        </p>

          Here&#39;s the answer you don&#39;t want to hear. <br><br>*It depends*. <br><br>What does that mean? Well, it depends on how the docs read. I&#39;ve been involved with deals where the capital partner only gets their incentives after either only a sale or a refi. <br><br>If we refi, the operating agreement needs to state (of course after negotiated and reflected on the term sheet - that if after a refi event, if the capital partner gets cash flow distributions or not. <br><br>Its part of the negotiation. I&#39;ve actually on some deals that I&#39;ve funded (non-student deals) have taken a steep cut in upfront points (gasp!) in exchange for longer term cash flow incentives, also called &quot;income kickers&quot;. <br><br>So its all about what you negotiate. <br><br>And there you go. <br><br>Your pal, <br>Sal        </p>

          Sal is my pal... Good day again. Question for you.<br>When I set up fund which states a 70 after a 10- are these %&#39;s off of the equity the deal creates when time to refi or sell? For example- 1 mill investment- after repair and repositioning complete- deal work 2 mill. Go to refi at 70% or 1.4 mill. The 10% pref gets paid off on the 1 mill- so that is 100k- but what happens to the other 300k after cash from refi- I understand the O.A. will state all details on buyouts and different provisions, etc- but investor still would stay in deal for the 30% of cash flow/equity,etc???? I would get 70% or my group??? Hope I explained it correctly. Thanks as always for the great education!!!        </p>

          Sal- watching webinar about sponsorship from someone else- will not mention name but he is well respected in industry.. I am getting the feeling here that the way they are explaining it is: the sponsor personally guarantees the deal or not- has assets and strong financials, but is not real hands on in the project- lets say M.F.<br><br>This is not what you are teaching. What gives? Thought sponsor was the owner operator and knows the ins and outs of successful operations in project??? Am I confused here?        </p>

          Sal is my Pal. Missed being here. Anyway- quick question for ya.<br>The partnership agreement that is in resources on the fundraising site, noticed this is for a single home or residential deal- can you use this for commercial as well, and also is this not almost the same as an operating agreement? Might seem contrite but I have meeting with my attorney in morning and wanted to present the right doc so he can see what my intentions are. Thanks for all you, AJ, and everyone else for helping make our intellectual capital to get where it needs to be. Richard        </p>

          My thoughts exactly. <br>This client brings $25k up front in the form of a retainer. The rest is in accordance with the agreement. I get paid when I bring in money. If I had compensation up front, I would think there would be a claim to more accountability. As it stands, I get nothing beyond the retainer if I don&#39;t produce capital. He loses nothing. <br>That retainer just keeps the lights on while I hunt. <br><br>How do you think I should word my reply?         </p>

          How do you think I should word my reply? I am a little confused as to how we can put in writing any differently that we will be taking responsibility for our actions (page 3, para 1). As it stands, we don&#39;t get paid if we don&#39;t bring in capital, and the Dandrew engagement letter already lists out what we&#39;ll do for the retainer.         </p>

          These are mentioned in the docs (operating agreement). <br><br>Depending on the color of the investors money determines what their rights and remedies are. <br><br>What is the basis for this question, by the way?         </p>

          I&#39;d love to get some color around the generally accepted pool of rights and remedies. I think it would help placement agents when advising clients. <br><br>The basis for my question is simple: you put me on this path. In the near future, we will be on our first road show. My client will need to present a believable case for securing institutional investor&#39;s capital - and he will have to understand the limits of his negotiating ability. <br><br>He&#39;s telling me (when prompted) that he&#39;s going to secure capital using methods usually reserved for mom and pop investors who put up funds via a syndication or TIC for an individual property. His fund is going to be secured a little differently. <br><br>I assumed it will be done through the operating agreements, but you taught us that institutional capital will have a voice. Between the lines, I&#39;ve deduced that capital providers will each have unique rules they must follow in order to secure their investor&#39;s capital. It makes sense that they will want fund manager&#39;s operating agreements to make allowances for their &quot;voice&quot; and investing parameters.         </p>

          I can explain more when we next speak privately. It&#39;s business model specific and proprietary. I&#39;m under agreement. It makes good sense for what we&#39;re doing on that project, but I&#39;m not sure how applicable it is to the rest of your community.         </p>

          Working through pitch book creation with my $250mm fund client. Can you give some examples of typical promote/carry structures that a Fund Manager can expect to receive? I&#39;m equally as interested in when they should expect to be compensated, as well as what method (% and/or fee), and how much. <br><br>I&#39;m guessing the structure changes with experience, so please give us the range from emerging manager to more seasoned. I acknowledge that everything is negotiated, but I want to help with expectations setting.         </p>

          As you know, I&#39;m getting ready to execute my second engagement letter this week. This one to organize a pitch book and do a raise around a smallish $15mm hard money fund. <br><br>My client raised a very few minor points in our engagement letter. Thought I&#39;d share them with the group and get your thoughts, if any. I figure if I&#39;m seeing these types of comments, others will see them too: <br>1. Bullet #5 should read &quot;of&quot; instead of &quot;if.&quot; &lt;- no big deal, but good for all of us to correct the typo. <br>2. Bullet #6: he asked to strike &quot;for the property&quot; because in his case, I&#39;m raising capital for his fund vs for a property. &lt;-again, no big deal. Just customizing. <br>3. He pointed out that he (the CLIENT) is to indemnify the AGENT, but that the AGENT is not indemnifying the CLIENT against misrepresentation.  I thought this was a little odd to ask for, since the CLIENT should have no occasion to represent the AGENT, but hey... I&#39;m letting him have it. <br>4. He asked about Mezzanine, and why we only charge 3% for each transaction. I really didn&#39;t have a good answer for him - other than to say many mezz lenders are dead today. We still provide the service when appropriate, and that 3% is the going rate.         </p>

          Sal,<br><br>I have been hired/partnered with a residential redevelopment company to take over the capital raising side of the business. The operator is qualified and just wants to focus his attention on the construction side, which is his specialty. His wife is an accountant, so she does that. He offered me 5% of the amount that I bring in, which is more than I thought was standard, but that&#39;s not important. I already have a wealthy trust deed investor for singe acquisitions, but I want to structure some kind of LP or fund to allow the company liquid capital to deploy immediately when a deal comes in. Once I set this up, I already have a few other companies who are waiting to work with me, and I have not done any marketing yet, so I have an interesting opportunity to integrate myself into many successful operations nationwide. This alone will expand my network, create massive credibility, and bring in countless opportunities to establish my career as a capital provider in not only residential, but across the board.<br><br>In one of the videos, you offered to show the students a residential pitch book you had done awhile back. Could I see that as well? Are there any other interesting materials or contacts that I can access to help me set this up? Thanks Sal!<br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br>Steve        </p>

          Steve<br><br>This is great. Did they give you a retainer? Are you doing the pitch book for free? What did they give you already? <br><br>What are they doing specifically? What is &quot;residential redevelopment&quot;? To me that means many different things. <br><br>Also, if you are *Private Equiteer*, there are a lot of pitch books available there in the *Fundraising Fundamentals*. <br><br>Keep in mind you&#39;re going to have to pay someone to put together your deck and if you&#39;re going dry, you&#39;ll have to come out of pocket for this. What kind of arrangement was this?<br><br>If you&#39;re acting as a Placement Agent, that is much, much different than just brokering capital. <br><br>*And you better have a signed agreement with them for the 5% otherwise I&#39;ll fly Matt there to Pitts to spank you silly.*<br><br>Sal         </p>

          Sal,<br><br>The profanity-free version of what I was thinking when I read &quot;Are you doing the pitch book for free?&quot; is no.<br><br>Keep in mind, this was all done before I became a private equiteer, so there will be some changes moving forward.<br><br>My retainer fee was $2,500. At least half would be paid up front, the rest upon delivery of the documents which included a business plan, PPM, etc. All expenses including legal, marketing travel (if necessary), etc. were separate from the fee. In this case, $2,000 was paid (which is what I used to purchase the private equiteer program). <br><br>Services included guiding the client through acquiring the documents and then finding investors for them to present their project to. No guarantees, funding was solely dependent on the investor&#39;s acceptance of the client&#39;s presentation and docs. <br><br>I have already made business plans for some of my own ideas, so I planned to do those myself, and that was the only product included in the retainer fee. The rest depended on their wallet, and would come straight from it to the law firm, etc. <br><br>Now, I have set up a meeting with this client to see if they want to go with the original arrangement or pay a few thousand more to do it this way. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m going to be doing it like the big boys as a private equiteer, so I&#39;m basically getting paid to learn your secrets. I love it!<br><br>Hit me with the real questions now, please.<br><br>Steve<br><br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Regarding the residential redevelopment question, you can see a successful company who&#39;s business model is nearly identical to a majority of rehabbers in my personal network at revamprealty.com. I had actually started my quest for knowledge nearly 2 years ago when I flew to PA from CA to funnel my first private lender&#39;s funds into Jenna&#39;s growing company. I ended up buying my first property from her and then moved into the city to do my own thing, and she followed the Fortune Builder&#39;s Mastery Training program to a T, even landed a speaking spot at Ignite in Vegas next month. Anyway, I have made connections and build solid friendships with many people in and out of the Fortune Builder&#39;s network. I never really progressed with the training, as I was dedicated to becoming the money man for other people&#39;s ventures, but I highly respect the program and I know exactly what a qualified operator in the residential redevelopment realm looks like from being a part of that program. I think that more than answered your question, and I am excited to be here. I feel like I am near the end of the starving student phase and I can see the beginning of a lifelong career right around the corner, doing exactly what I want to be doing. Not many people can say that, and I feel pretty good about it.         </p>

          Sal, <br><br>No, the $2,500 was for me. The other costs are aside from that. I made it clear that the total cost could be $10k to $15k. I know of places who charge $25k just for the PPM, and I&#39;ve heard of other people who use the same one over and over I know that&#39;s not a good move for different ventures, but what if it was for the same business model, just different sponsors? I&#39;m not looking to raise more than $5M per client right now, and the idea was to set up a system where I could just gain experience with something I know and build my own list of active investors for my deals using these small capital raises with identical business models until I had personal relationships with enough investors to be able to move on to something bigger when the opportunity presented itself.<br><br>I understand a quality pitchbook will probably run around $1k, the cost of the PPM  varies, but I saw something about your lawyer only charging $2k? I also read another post that mentioned the total cost to his client would be around $12k ($10k retainer + $2k PPM). Once I get quality marketing materials, couldn&#39;t I just use them with some minor edits for other companies, since the nuts and bolts of a fix &amp; flip business is pretty much standard? If the PPM is only $2k, then that&#39;s not an issue at all. <br><br>I&#39;m basically just asking for general advice or things to pay extra attention to, or maybe little things that I can do to streamline the process so I can have a few smaller sized projects going around the country at any given time, while making residual and repeat income from clients during the term of their raise, which was initially one year. Based on the buying criteria, they would be able to pay 10%-12% annual interest with quarterly payments and 15%-30% of their annual net profit. As long as they used the money at least once, they would be able to at least cover the interest with a small amount to the investor at the end. In reality, these people can turn the money over at least 2 or 3 times. Now that I&#39;m learning different ways to structure the return, I am a little confused as to the optimal way to set this up. I&#39;m sure I will figure it all out eventually, but I&#39;d like to go to my current client with this today so I don&#39;t have to keep modifying the plan. I know my original structure might have been close, but not as professional as it should be.<br><br>I know you&#39;re a very busy man, so I&#39;ll stop here. The more I learn, the more questions I have, and I am more of an interactive learner, so I&#39;m hoping to find a more experienced private equiteer to bounce ideas around rather than write novels to you here. <br><br>Thanks Sal,<br><br>Steve<br><br>        </p>

          Sal - Tomorrow afternoon, I am meeting (again) with the client you and I have discussed off line. This client has a mature system, a lot of experience, a good track record, and a differentiated strategy that I believe we can prove. Of all the contacts I&#39;ve made to date, he&#39;s likely in the best position to begin the process of becoming a fund manager. I&#39;m helping him with expectations and providing big-picture tomorrow and have three questions:<br>1. What are your thoughts re: Timeline - how long should he be expected to invest before he gets his fund capitalized?  (Prequin says avg was 17.5 months in 2012, but you have recent experience and contacts) <br>2. Resource commitment: What can I tell him that will put him in the ball park of what he should expect to invest to get this up and running: internal compliance, pitch book, reporting, road show, registration, ongoing operations?  <br>3. What is the current market sentiment regarding stabilized and mid-range value add product? Do you think he&#39;s got a chance, given what you already know, to differentiate enough to attract institutional capital? <br>        </p>

          Dave<br>These are great questions. I’m (trying to be) on vacation this week so sorry I’ve not responded faster. Here are the answers to your questions.<br>1.  What does this question mean by “invested”? <br>“how long should he be expected to invest before he gets his fund capitalized?”<br><br>2.  40K – 60K. That’s conservative on the higher-end and you’ll probably be able to get these expenses compressed too a little. <br><br>3.  There are a lot of players in this niche, its getting crowded. So you’re strategy has to be specific and refined. Just buying apts isn’t going to get anyone excited. But you do know this after working with us. <br><br>Sal        </p>

          Interested in the size of the Dandrew box re: pref equity. Is it the same as for debt lending or can the pref equity box flex smaller?<br><br>I saw two deals from a team over lunch this afternoon. Both low value requirements: $200k - $400k. One isn&#39;t worth mentioning as they already have capital for it. The second, for which they need $400k (likely pref equity)  is to complete a debt stack that will acquire and reposition a self storage, a mobile home park, and a piece of land as a 3-part single package. They are getting in at a good basis in a Carolina tertiary market due to mismanagement, low occupancy and repositioning - lot&#39;s of hair. The acquisition is assisted by seller financing and has a few interesting upsides: like an extra parcel of land and a few good uses for it. <br><br>$400K seems like it may be in the &quot;too small for Sal&quot; category, but it is representative of deals that this group sees (and closes on) regularly - several times per year. I thought I&#39;d ask.         </p>

          $400K is too small for *anyone* in this space. They&#39;re better off paying you 10K to get a deck and some docs together so you can raise this on demand from other investors. <br><br>AJ and I are testing a very experienced atty to do PPM, Subscription Agreement and Operating Agreements for less than 2K for this NNN fund. <br><br>Email me next week for his contact.

          Incredible value. That attorney is going to have business, certainly from me, if your test works out. <br><br>Following your advice, coupled with your attorney, costs my client $12K total + 5% of money raised, earns them a deck, my labor, and a stable of golf and cigar investors to fund their deal. <br><br>We set up an SPE (two actually) using the docs the attorney created and use one as a funding entity to fund a limited partner entity in the deal. Do I have that right? <br><br>I&#39;m used to Reg D syndication - which typically costs another $15-25K to paper, and background checks to ensure investors are accredited.         </p>
