          Byron,<br><br>Good question.<br><br>I think its safe to say that as of the date that we posted this tape, all assets on the tape were available.  <br><br>From my understanding, its not good practice for us to constantly ping the seller of a tape (in this case, Freddie MAC) for a consistent update of individual assets, just for us to post those updates.  <br><br>I think the safest course if action is, if there are assets of interest, place a meaningful bid on those assets.  If the particular assets are available, with a valid bid in place, the seller will then say that those are or are not available.  Without a valid bid, larger institutions in particular, see the question without a bid behind it a waste of time, and as a result, the asker of the question looses credibility.<br><br>--AJ<br><br>        </p>

          Hi Dave, I notice the last heat map posted is dated July 17, 2015.  Does this mean the markets nationwide haven&#39;t changed enough to post a new heat map?  Or that one is coming?<br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Byron        </p>

          Hi Dave, a couple of months ago on a Silver conference call I told you about a Minnesota client who is consolidating his holdings in Texas, totaling 4,400 acres, and gradually exiting the state.  He is selling ground located in a county that adjoins the Dallas/Ft. Worth MSA, less than 60 miles from the Dallas CBD.  He is motivated because he is well past normal retirement age and wants to eliminate his travel to Texas.  There is no &quot;financial distress,&quot; however, just potentially lucrative terms available.<br><br>An investor/developer can pick up the remaining fully entitled pad sites, totaling 72.09 acres, @ $1.23/sq. ft. all-cash ($4.035MM), or $2.46/acre with very favorable terms ($8.07MM).  The most recent trade in that development (comp) closed during mid-2015 on 1.3 acres @ $5.50/sq. ft.  There is also a non-binding LOI @ $3.50/sq. ft. on a 21+ acre parcel. <br><br>You told me I should submit the trade to AJ who would get it out to the Silver members because &quot;there are people on this call who are interested in a trade like this.&quot;   However, when I asked him how to proceed last week, he referred me back to you.<br><br>How do I post this trade on the Silver website?  <br><br>What preliminary data should I submit?<br><br>There are 72.09 retail acres for sale. Residential in the DFW MSA coming if you are interested.<br><br>What is the range of interest rates you are offering on the luxury toy financing?<br><br>And, how big is “big?” <br><br>Thanks,<br><br>Byron        </p>

          Byron, this is AJ.  <br><br>My apologies, perhaps I misunderstood when I referred you back to Dave on this.   <br><br>If you think that Dave is a potential buyer or funder, this is a good place for that.

          Hello Dave, I recently received three  NYC Trading Desk alerts:  <br><br>1)  Residential performing residential loans @ 6%; <br><br>2) Looking for buyers of FL HOA super liens, and; <br><br>3)  Mid-tier 3-5MM commercial properties NPL&#39;s.<br><br>The Alerts imply that my membership to AskDandrew Silver gets me the details.  When visited the silver.kajabi.com website to learn the specifics about these trades, I find that none of them is posted.<br> <br>Will you post these trades under &quot;Assets for Trade&quot; soon?  Or communicate the details to us some other way and let us know?<br><br>Also, I first emailed the Dandrew Support team.  They referred me to the AskDandrew Silver Owner&#39;s Manual to find out how to submit my question.  Where is the owner&#39;s manual for your site?  I can&#39;t locate it under the tabs.<br> <br>Thank you.<br> <br> Byron        </p>

          Byron, this is AJ.<br><br>Sorry for the delayed response.  Dave asked me to handle this question instead, since it is more logistical than he handles, and there was a delay in my getting to this.<br><br>Now, onto your questions.<br><br>These text alerts are general guidelines, and they rarely correspond with a specific asset for trade.  In the case of the 3 that you quote here, none of them correspond with a specific asset for trade.<br><br>They are intentionally vague in that, they do not refer to a specific deal, pool, or tape.  Yet, they are intended to be specific enough in order to encourage thoughtful &amp; meaningful dealflow from intermediaries, such as yourself.  <br><br>But keep in mind, that non-AskDandrew Silver members also can get these if they sign up.  It is designed to regularly remind them of the opportunities they may be missing out on crossing trades that may be right in front of them.<br><br>So, my apologies, Byron, when you say &quot;The Alerts imply that my membership to AskDandrew Silver gets me the details.&quot;, here&#39;s why:<br><br>With a text message, we can only cram in so many characters before they fill up even 2 separate text message, so we are limited.  The details you get with AskDandrew Silver membership, is training on what those terms mean, where to go to find these assets or these buyers, depending on which we are asking for.  So, the implication is vague here only because we don&#39;t have enough characters for a verbose explanation such as this.<br><br>But, since you ask such a good question, I thought it deserved a verbose answer here.  And an apology for the confusion it has caused you.<br><br>--------------------------------------<br><br>Your question about the owner&#39;s manual is, hands down, our most asked question.<br><br>The owners manual is found at the top of the dashboard, which is the first tab one comes to when first logging in to AskDandrew silver.<br><br>Here&#39;s a picture of exactly where to find it.  The manual is front and center, but evidently, still hard to see.<br><br>http://redirect.dandrewmedia.com/ADSilverManual.png<br><br>My apologies for the confusion, and thanks for participating!<br><br>-AJ<br><br><br><br><br>        </p>

          Thanks for your helpful reply.  So, rarely is there an active trade behind an alert.  I got it.<br><br>Jaqueline had the same questions for Dave about the details of the (phantom) trade re: the same performing RESI loans alert that I asked about, so I guess I wasn&#39;t the only confused member.  Dave replied that he is looking to buy bulk performing loans $3MM and up but not selling now.  That is good to know.<br><br>I&#39;m sure the members would LOVE to see a regular (monthly?) written summary by email, or posted on the Silver site, of what Dave is buying and selling, and what to look for when crossing trades, as the market&#39;s change.  After the first summary is posted, then anything that has changed could be posted in RED to note the change.  This would be &quot;communicating by exception,&quot; like &quot;management by exception.&quot;  Pretty simple.<br><br>Also, perhaps the texts could be used for both to: 1) stimulate our thinking about crossing trades, and; 2) notify us if there is an active trade the Dave, or ANOTHER member, is pursuing.  Could you add the words &quot;Active Trade!&quot; to the text so we would know? Then I would check the &quot;Assets for Trade&quot; tab at the website.  That would require no additional texting accounts be set up and managed.<br><br>Again, thanks!        </p>

          Byron,<br><br>Thanks for the kind words.<br><br>As far as a regular monthly written summary by email, good suggestion as always, Byron.  We have not forgotten that you always want summaries of things like this in writing.  We appreciate that desire, and as we develop this group, it may happen.<br><br>However for now, here&#39;s the best mindset to have.  Sometimes these things trade fast, in just hours or days.  At this time, we could invest a fair amount of time into crafting an email that would be outdated quickly, and potentially cause additional confusion.<br><br>Our ability to keep the Assets For Trade section is a challenge, so let us first master the accuracy there, and then we will consider moving on to a regular written email summary.  I would hate to have us produce multiple inaccurate resources.<br><br>As far as your multi-purpose use for texts, well worded there, Byron.  I think you have very accurately captured our exact intention with these, in your statements right here.<br><br>You may have noticed that we put your &quot;Active Trade&quot; statement suggestion into practice already, in our text yesterday.  We worded it slighly differently, but we hopefully made it just as clear to everyone.<br><br>Hopefully, you got that, and have already reviewed that &quot;REO Freddie MAC - 08/25/2015&quot; assset we put there yesterday.<br><br>Keep the good feedback coming, Byron...always appreciated!<br><br>-AJ        </p>
