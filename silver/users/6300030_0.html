          Dave - I&#39;ve been looking at that Servicing Due Diligence Questionnaire and I understand that there is no way that my company, Westborn Capital Partners, LLC can qualify for the bank pool that we are looking at under that guide. <br>Since there are:<br><br>Scratch and Dent      309         $ 60,030,973 <br>TDR (foreclosed)      158         $ 36,332,219 <br>NPL                            56         $ 13,174,295 <br>TOTAL                      523          $ 109,537,487<br><br>and you usually stay at around the $5 MM pool size, I would like to propose a collaboration whereby Westborn uses your credibility re the Servicing Questionnaire, and we come to the table as a subcontractor under your company with $5 - 10 MM to purchase our own notes.  We are very Michigan centric and I know that&#39;s not your cup of tea, but we do have investors who purchase in FL, TX, AZ, CA also.  I understand that you would have first chance at properties that you like, but with a pool of over $100 MM, I don&#39;t think we will step on each other&#39;s toes.<br><br>I would also like to propose that we would need direct communication to accomplish this in the given time span as Feb 16 is the due date for the bids.<br><br>Thank you for your consideration,<br>Jacqueline<br>        </p>

          Dave - since you know the bank we are dealing with, I am interested to know what you would bid on the Scratch N Dent and the TDR&#39;s (troubled debt restructuring).  Here is what they said to me:<br>&quot;We are not giving pricing guidance on the pools.  Given that they are all currently performing we would obviously expect levels consistent with that type of performance&quot;.<br>Thanks - Jacqueline        </p>

          Just a big Thank You , Dave -- for all of your help and insights yesterday.  You shared so much with us and it clarified the bank process to such a degree that our strategy became immediately solidified.  As it became clear that our goal was different from yours, we really understood where we wanted to position ourselves in the process.  <br>Terrific ! Thanks ! Jacqueline        </p>

          Hi Dave - By now, you have probably seen the tapes provided by our mutual friend.  As you know, there are 3 pools - NPL&#39;s, TDR&#39;s and Scratch &amp; Dent<br><br>NPL&#39;s - what does the bank mean when they say:<br>&quot;For the NPL pool we&#39;ve provided an indication of our minimum threshold value at the loan level.  All bids must be on the loan level.  The winning bidder will be chosen based on the largest overall pool size bid and with the bid nearest to the threshold values.&quot;  <br><br>  1. Question:  Is this the Nbhd Value Range? (for ex. the Nbhd is $60,000 to $105,000) What does Nbhd stand for?<br>  2. What is a good bid if $60,000 is 75% of the UPB?<br><br>What does the &quot;TDR&quot; in TDR-Data-Tape mean? <br>Under the column Bus Chan there are 3 choices: (what do these names mean?)<br><br>  1. Correspondent<br>  2. Wholesale<br>  3. Retail<br><br>What does this mean - DLQ Matrix page ?<br>  <br>What are the pricing expections for TDR&#39;s?  For ex. one FL property has a UPB of $139,000 and the pricing on the BPO is for $155,000 list and sale.<br><br>SCRATCH AND DENT - what is the pricing expectation?<br>     One property with an UPB of $137,000 has a suggested &quot;as is&quot; BPO of  $140,000<br><br>Do you know what the minimum purchase is that bank expects?  I have several people interested in the pools and expect to represent them in the purchase.  Do I bring in each one of the buyers separately or do I just represent  one purchase and then separate the notes myself?  Am I making any sense?<br><br>Thanks so much for your help,<br>Jacqueline<br>        </p>

          Hey Jacqueline, my answers are below<br><br>NPL’s – what does the bank mean when they say: <br>“For the NPL pool we’ve provided an indication of our minimum threshold value at the loan level. All bids must be on the loan level. The winning bidder will be chosen based on the largest overall pool size bid and with the bid nearest to the threshold values.” <br>This means they will not take any bids into considerations without hitting those minimums. If you cant get to that number pretty much don’t send in bids. Bid on property by property .Make sense??<br><br><br>1. Question: Is this the Nbhd Value Range? (for ex. the Nbhd is $60,000 to $105,000) What does Nbhd stand for?  <br>I am not sure what NBHD stands for I am not familiar with that turn and without seeing what you are looking at I can’t answer that<br>2. What is a good bid if $60,000 is 75% of the UPB? <br>I don’t have enough information what is the value of the property? I am missing some important facts here to give you a solid answer. You do have the heat map to work off of for pricing. That heat map is based on the lesser of the two values or upb. We have discussed this in the past and that is why those tools are there. So I will flip the question to you is 75 of UPB a bid or not based off the heat map and your professional knowledge? <br><br>What does the “TDR” in TDR-Data-Tape mean? <br>Most likely a internal term not important feel free to ask your contact though just in case<br>Under the column Bus Chan there are 3 choices: (what do these names mean?) <br><br>1. Correspondent <br>2. Wholesale <br>3. Retail <br><br>What does this mean – DLQ Matrix page ? <br>This refers to how the loan were originated and the bank obtained them<br>Correspondent-sells packages in bulk to bank<br>Wholesale  sells loans on a one off basis to bank<br>Retail are the bank branches and bought via there branches etc.<br><br>What are the pricing expections for TDR’s? For ex. one FL property has a UPB of $139,000 and the pricing on the BPO is for $155,000 list and sale. <br>This is a perfect tool for your heat map!!! You have pricing in FL at 67 cents upb or value the lesser of the two for this case that would be UPB. SO a reasonable bid here is 93,000 give or take. Please use the tools we have provided it will really help answer these questions for you in the future. <br>SCRATCH AND DENT – what is the pricing expectation? <br>One property with an UPB of $137,000 has a suggested “as is” BPO of $140,000 <br>Jacqueline this is a question for your client not me. They can only tell you what pricing expectations are as they are selling it. I would say scratch and dent should trade for the mid to high 80’s of UPB on average <br><br>Do you know what the minimum purchase is that bank expects? I have several people interested in the pools and expect to represent them in the purchase. Do I bring in each one of the buyers separately or do I just represent one purchase and then separate the notes myself? Am I making any sense? <br>Jacqueline I would have your multiple bids come back to you with there bids organize them with what you think are the best ones and go back to your bank client with bids.<br>Please build a fee into this and make sure your clients know they will have to pay you a fee and sign a confidentiality agreement.<br><br>Best of luck you are really getting there I see you working on this and I truelly hope something comes of it!! <br><br>Thanks so much for your help, <br>Jacqueline<br>        </p>

          Back again Dave !  Thanks for all the above.  <br><br>Our mutual friend just posted a &quot;Servicer Due Diligence Questionnaire&quot; which asks all kinds of questions about our firm&#39;s experience in servicing mortgages; <br>*   whether we&#39;re in good standing with Fannie, Freddie, HUD, etc,; <br>*   if our firm has been in the business of servicing mortgages for 3 yrs and can we supply 3 yrs or audited financial statements;<br>*   does our firm have the necessary local, state and federal licenses to service loans in 50 states;<br>*   does our firm have the experience, systems and capabilities to support all the products for the contemplated sale; <br>*   Is our firm compliant with CFPB Mortgage Service transfer requirements, including, but not limited to: <br>1) In flight activities for Loss Mitigation, Short Sale, Foreclosure, Bankruptcy, Escrow, Payments, etc.; and<br>2) Ability to complete the transfer with detailed reconciliation, issue management and monitoring of borrower impact items?<br>*   does our firm have formal policies and procedures that demonstrate that investor requirements are balanced against customer expectations? Please describe.&quot;  <br><br>As you can see, it is quite involved and goes on for some time in this vein.  Does this mean that they will only sell these loans to an established entity and, if so, is there anyway that, because of my long time relationship with Dandrew (at least since 2009) and you (this past year) I could purchase for my investors through you?  <br><br>Thanks ! Jacqueline        </p>

          Dave - I just wanted to add a couple of things to my last post.  We have an ongoing, long term relationship with this bank as my partner is a childhood friend of the Vice President in charge of the Secondary Market.  We had lunch with the VP who put me in touch with our mutual friend there, and I had hoped that my relationship with Dandrew and you would be equal to the task of taking down part of the pool since many of the properties are in the Diamond states. <br><br>We now have a huge network of professionals who will be able to handle many of the properties you wouldn&#39;t be interested in.  And, since the bank offers these pools quarterly, we expect to be in this for the long term.  We would be able to show you a POF and LOI, and, certainly, would add whatever compensation to your company that you thought fair.   We would like you to let us come in under your umbrella until we have the 3 year servicing part taken care of and the formal platforms in place.<br><br>Thanks again, Jacqueline        </p>

          Hi Dave - sorry I had to miss the last conference call this month.  I&#39;m expecting a tape from our mutual friend Ted in MI by next week.  I was told there May be FL, TX &amp; CA on it - NPN&#39;s and REO&#39;s.  Don&#39;t know yet if resi, commercial or both.  <br><br>I have applied for Dandrew&#39;s POF but was wondering if you have a POF for us to use separately.  I have NDA&#39;s from quite a number of people who want to look at the tape.  Do I need to get a POF from everyone who wants to look at the tape?  Should I have done that already?<br><br>Dandrew has a Master Fee Agreement which asks for 3 % of purchase, with 1/3 going to Buyer&#39;s Facilitator, 1/3 going to Seller&#39;s Facilitator (who is that ?!) and 1/3 going to Intermediary Facilitator (me) for 1 pt a piece.  Should I be including my Buyer&#39;s rep like this in a Master fee agreement?  In most cases, I have the relationships with the reps.  Should this be going out now before the tape comes out?<br><br>Naïve questions, I know, but this is my first tape and I want to &quot;get the right&quot;!  (I may ask more next week)<br><br>Jacqueline (from Detroit)        </p>

          Hi Dave – sorry I had to miss the last conference call this month. I’m expecting a tape from our mutual friend Ted in MI by next week. I was told there May be FL, TX &amp; CA on it – NPN’s and REO’s. Don’t know yet if resi, commercial or both. <br>Ted usually deals in just resi but good luck as I am seeing it directly already. But there are a lot of other accounts that would like to see this tape!!<br><br>I have applied for Dandrew’s POF but was wondering if you have a POF for us to use separately. I have NDA’s from quite a number of people who want to look at the tape. Do I need to get a POF from everyone who wants to look at the tape? Should I have done that already? <br> I only supply proof of funds to sellers on a accepted trade from me. Most firms know who we are so I don’t have to show them anything until we have a accepted trade. So the short answer is yes I have a proof of funds but I provide that only for trades I am doing with my fund ARC<br><br>Dandrew has a Master Fee Agreement which asks for 3 % of purchase, with 1/3 going to Buyer’s Facilitator, 1/3 going to Seller’s Facilitator (who is that ?!) and 1/3 going to Intermediary Facilitator (me) for 1 pt a piece. Should I be including my Buyer’s rep like this in a Master fee agreement? In most cases, I have the relationships with the reps. Should this be going out now before the tape comes out? <br>A Sellers facilitator is the broker who introduced the seller on the collateral to the buyer in the case you mentioned above that would be you if a trade was to get done. AS for should it be going out now it depends on your level of trust with your counterparty and how much diligence you have done. Personally I would never sign a fee agreement on a trade until I felt it was going someplace.<br><br>Naïve questions, I know, but this is my first tape and I want to “get the right”! (I may ask more next week) <br>There is no such thing as a naïve question my goal is to help you get more trades and to also bring new opportunities to my firm!! Best of luck and to your success!!!<br><br>Jacqueline (from Detroit<br>        </p>

          Hi Dave,  I just spoke with Ted from you know where.  He was so cordial and very forthcoming.  They put out their pools quarterly and will have a new one mid-January.  Their last pool included CA, FL MI, IL, TX, NY.  He also asked if I was interested in REO&#39;s.  They have a set protocol and I will have access to the bank files online. They will also have pricing expectations.  I have tons of buyers for local product so that looks good in addition to national buyers, including yourself, I hope.  Have a great holiday season, Jacqueline        </p>

          Jacqueline, As you know I know them well as I am sure Ted has told you. But once you have a tape from them I would talk about it with other students and your clients. This is a big bank with tons of assets to trade!! To your success. IF you would like tell AJ to post what you think is coming and he can get some interest level. Good luck!!         </p>

          Hi Dave - This is Jacqueline from Detroit.  I noticed that you said here last month that you weren&#39;t interested in Detroit.  On the call yesterday when you mentioned the comments on the latest heatmap, you had Michigan listed.  Does this mean you will do Michigan - perhaps Detroit&#39;s better suburbs ?  or are you speaking only of Grand Rapids?<br>Thanks - Jacqueline        </p>

          Jacqueline the heat map is for where things are trading as a whole. I have not bought any in Michigan myself in a long time. Mostly because I dont have a team in place there. I would say that prcing is where assets are trading as a whole and there are buyers who are buying at levels on the heat map. I have had many of your fellow students talk to me about buyers of Michigan properties. Just not inner city...If you have stuff to show please show it to the desk. LEts get some trades done!!        </p>

          Jacqueline we are looking for bulk performing loans 3MM and up would be the preferred size.  Looking to purchase not sell. We had a pool of performing loans we sold about 4 months ago that I showed to students and I sold it to a students contact. I am looking for more performing whole loans to sell to that same account.        </p>

          Hi Dave, thanks for the call yesterday.  I checked on the website of the investment company I was telling you about.  They do much the same thing that Dandrew does, except at higher levels - 50 MM - 700 MM.  They also do more than real estate - manufacturing, power, oil and gas, gaming and lodging, etc. - and are more of a buy and hold company.  That&#39;s why I thought they might be interested if you, Sal or Rog (Raj) had something to sell.<br>Jacqueline        </p>

          Jacqueline I am very sorry for the delayed response I just saw this,Can you be more specific what they are looking for? Telling me they do something similar to us is not specific enough. Its like saying I buy a houses. Some people want a 1 bedroom house others want mansions!! Get some specifics we are always selling but pricing and buyers have to match up. ALso talk to your other fellow students and use linked in to find new buyers and sellers...Best of luck!!        </p>

          Hi Dave - I posted this on Ask Dandrew and Sal suggested I post this to your site.<br><br>&quot;I have been in communication this week with a representative of the investment division of a Texas bank with over 3 B. in total assets. They have NPN’s, PN’s, and REO product, but during the course of our conversation, he said that they had senior security investments (don’t know what that is ) and that they don’t do anything under $50 MM. He was very cordial and said he was happy to know of our company and would recommend us for anything under their (is it axe or wheel house?) and would happy for us to do likewise. I don’t know enough to know if something could be worked out with them that would be advantageous to Dandrew so I asked him if he would be interested in having a conversation with one of our senior traders. He said he would be happy to. &quot;<br><br>This was Sal&#39;s final comment, &quot;Jacqueline, listen to me. If you’re getting his far with the heavy hitters, it may be worth a serious look into getting involved with this as this is a group that a bunch of hardcore arbitragers&quot;.<br><br>Thanks Dave for taking a look at this,<br>Jacqueline<br>        </p>

          Jacqueline, I am unaware of the term senior security investments. IF I was going to guess that means senior debt or leverage which we put on alot of our trades as well. But you are telling me this is a 3B bank and they dont do trades under 50MM. I find that hard to believe as that would be 5% of there total book!! I have a feeling this is a brokerage division within a bank and they are brokering deals for others. But that is just a hunch from the facts you are laying out. There are a ton of deals out there from one offs to large deals. I tend to be winning more of the 3-5MM dollar deals because they have a bit more yield then the larger deals. Please continue to be on the hunt if not for me for others. This does work and it has been working for others!! thanks        </p>

          Dave, I&#39;m new to Silver and AskDandrew.  Just to be clear, on the heat map, the number on the state is the  average percentage pricing for an NPN; e.g., the average price paid for NPN&#39;s in Florida would be 72% and I could quote that as an average price if asked.  I thought you could get NPN&#39;s with a bigger discount or does that just apply to the blue states?  The price for bulk REO then is 10 % higher, or 82%.  Yes?  Thank you, Jacqueline        </p>

          Jacqueline, welcome to Silver. There are always cheaper assets out their but the heat map is meant to show  averages on where things are trading. I will be updating this over the next few weeks so please keep  your eye out for that!! This is the most effective tool when speaking to clients it shows you kow what you are taking about and they will take you more seriously!!  You can always get loans at bigger discounts but it varies by demand and also average sizes of the loans. <br><br>Lastly you are correct pricing for REO tends to be about 10% higher for REO bulk trades then NPL on a state by state bulk basis. I hope this helps and look forward to you joining our call this afternoon. Happy New Years.        </p>
