          Dave, I took the list and I applied one more filter, so that we have only Florida.  Then I removed all UPB values below $90k and above $700k to get a list of 177 properties with an average UPB of $243.5k and total of $43M.  Would you bid 62 cents + 3 cents agents fee, for a total of 65 cents for these properties?        </p>

          Again this is a list of properties I have seen if it is the same list we discussed before? If the values make sense and if it is a different pool please send it to me. I am paying those numbers as a % of value or UPB the lesser of the two. My guess is it sounds cheap unless its inner city or a area . It is is different then what we discussed please forward me as I have viewed the other list and bid a portion of it already         </p>

          Dave, are you currently working with Incenter or BlackStone?  I just recently established a relationship with a licensed and insured agent who is direct.  The agent can deliver nationwide NPN tapes.  For instance, the tape I just received has a total of 1158 properties with a total UPB over $304M with an average UPB of $263+k and an average property value of $347+k.  I filtered out all properties with UPB&#39;s less than $80k and more than $900k.  Next, I filtered out all &quot;black&quot; states according to the latest heat map, which left 844 properties with an average UPB $280k; average BPO $296k.  Protocol, minimum purchase is $2.5M and submit a bid for the properties you want.  Incenter will then accept or counter.  A sliding fee structure (based on total purchase amount) will either be added on to the total bid or included in the individual property bid by Incenter at time of acceptance.  (Fee schedule: $2.5-50M = 3% Acquisition Fee; Over $50M Up to $100M = 2% Acquisition Fee; Over $100M = 1.5% Acquisition Fee).  The tapes can be pulled frequently and I can have the tapes tailored to suit your criteria.  Would this be of interest to you?        </p>

          I know them both very well. Incenter is a broker dealer owned by Blackstone though they dont own or market any collateral. Again this is now a 4 party daisy chain!! Something we have discussed many many times. Let me lay out your daisy chain. You 1, you have a contact who is talking to Incenter 2 Incenter is talking to a client as a broker 3 client number 4. I have made it pretty clear in the past the way to get trades done is not through brokers anyone asking for a fee is a broker and this is a broker on top of a broker on top of a broker. There are three brokers before a end account is being even talked to. On a final note Incenter sent me this pool direct. They are direct with the client. Which is where you need to be to get trades done, I am not trying to call you out but you will look like a fool if you showed this to other clients. Credibility is key in this business if it is looking for stuff for your portfolio or brokering. The whole purpose of what we have discussed is going to clients directly and getting tapes directly from owners! I promise you do the steps it will pay off!! By your comments above you knew this was not a direct relationship they are asking a brokerage fee!!        </p>

          Dave, The Mil Lake Shopping Plaza came on the market 9 days ago located in Palm Beach County on Lake Worth Rd.  I have signed a co-brokering agreement with Cohen Commercial who is brokering this opportunity.  The two big boxes anchoring the plaza are Big Lots (GLA=30,510) and Habitat for Humanity (GLA=32,683).  Asking $17 million at 6.9% cap with total GLA=128,573.  The upside potential includes renegotiating with Big Lots from a gross to a NNN lease plus they have been paying under market rents.  The Big Lots lease expires 1/31/19.  Currently there are 2 small retail vacancies, GLA = 850 and 1920.  Overall, a good balanced tenant mix in a blue collar demographic.<br>CVS and KFC are two really big draws BUT are NOT included (separately owned), although CVS pays for an access easement.  Plaza was built between 1978 – 1982 although it is not terrible on deferred maintenance as most of the roof has been replaced and 40-50% of the AC units have been replaced all over the last 3 years.  Parking lot resealed and restriped and many units have been gutted and completely renovated in 2015.<br>Location and traffic flow is very good as Arby’s has been lobbying for a spot for several years.  A 1,000 home development is proposed 5 miles away.  Several plays include repurpose tenancy or treat as land bank.  The seller is downsizing in retirement, actually 3 individual HNW partners, who don’t want to leave this asset to their children. <br>        </p>

          That seems like a great property but I am not a buyer of anything at a 6.9 Cap. That is a investment for a REIT or a private investor as you know. I like to fix problems sell things at a 6.9 CAP. Best of luck in the sale it is a great property.         </p>

          Dave,<br>There is a bulk package available of 56 stabilized rental properties in various Florida cities, with a total asking price of $11.7 million for an average asking value of $208,810 per asset; mostly SFR with 13 townhouses.<br>On an individual asset basis, the lowest asset asking price is $131,040 while the rest are $156,000 and up, with the highest asset asking price at $312,000.<br>The total annual gross rent collected is $1,124,364 with an NOI of $610,182, thus the net yield is 5.22%.  There is one property management company handling all the properties at a 10% rate per asset, so there may be room to negotiate a better overall rate.<br>I think there is room for some rental increases but I don’t know for sure yet.  I am still investigating. At the present cap rate, is this package of interest to you?<br>        </p>

          Would you buy 56 stabilized properties at a 5.2% return and have to go through the headache of managing 52 properties?? You can buy a commercial property NNN with he best of the best tenant with that return. This would be 10X the headache for the same reward. I am not sure who that would make sense to. Just wondering why you think this is a good deal??        </p>

          Hi Dave, Do you buy performing loans?  A few highlights:<br><br>• $90MM in “QM” residential mortgages<br>• 8 pools organized by states, comprised of Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, Ohio, West   Virginia, and Maryland<br>• Over half of the loans are to low- and moderate-income (“LMI”) individuals and/or geographies, thus helping   institutions meet Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) and Fair Lending requirements<br>• All loans are performing with zero 30-day delinqunecies<br>• Weighted average coupon of 4.39% with average FICOS of 734, and DTI of 33.91%<br>        </p>

          I am most likely not the best bid for these or even close. They are CRA eligible so I assume that want high 90 to over par. Have you asked them about pricing on this pool?  There are a ton of bank and financial institution buyers that come to mind that do buy this paper. The one that comes to mind off the top off my head is FNBA out of Michigan we have talked about them on the call before. Good luck. If they are selling this at a discount I could be a buyer but I highly doubt they are. Enjoy your long weekend!!        </p>

          Hi Dave, sorry I missed this, as I thought I was watching for a response.  I do have the rent rolls and other assorted documentation.  The lease for the President Supermarket expires July 2023, Wendy&#39;s July 2028, Flannigans November 2038, etc.  I am uploading the information through the Dandrew deal submittal portal.  The name is Waterside Shopping Plaza.        </p>

          Sorry Dave, I forgot to mention that after further review the actual NOI is a little lower than originally projected.  A mis-calculation as all tenants are triple net leasees however, there is a CAM expenses for the 4 vacancies, so the current NOI is $927,780.79.  You would see that in the documents that I will send.        </p>

          Dave,<br>There is an 18 property note package available; workouts are complete and ready for foreclosure.  1 Property is in Lake Worth Fl, the other 17 are in NY/NJ.  The total balance owed is $7.17mm, total Zillow Value is $7.3mm, and the note package price is $4.58mm.<br><br>The lowest balance owed in the package is $165,200, while the highest balance owed is $859,000; thus the package mean is $384,258 (the mean is between $213,000 and $580,000).<br><br>Is this of interest to you?<br><br>Thanks,<br>Tim        </p>

          That is 63% of value that is crazy!!! Especially for NY and NJ. I would never ever pay that dollar price for those assets. Maybe other fellow students can or have buyers who will. IF you would like and are comfortable add the tape to deals for other students to look at. Good luck Tim        </p>

          Tim,<br>I am wondering why you think it is such a great buy??  If UPB is 1,000,000 because it has a first and a second for example and property value is only say 300,000 so I would pay say 175 for the asset less all outstanding taxes and liens. When pricing assets you need to be very very carefull of someone selling on a UPB basis what if there are 150k in outstanding taxes adding to my overall price.When people are selling you on a UPB basis they are usually trying to trick you into thinking your getting a better deal then you are. I think you will be surprised to hear most of that is BS. If your client is willing to show you a level based on current BPO I will 100% have a look at the tape. Let me know and you can send me a tape.        </p>

          Dave, <br>Thank you sir, for your time and kind reply. I appreciate your insight and patience.  I am glad to hear that I am on the right track as to ascertaining value.  I was looking at the BPO and Assessed Value column data to derive the true value picture but I failed to pass along the numbers and percentages earlier.  However, I was reluctant as there is some missing data from all columns including the UPB, however the biggest holes are in the Assessed Value and BPO columns.   As an example of missing data for one asset, the assessed column has a value of $124,000 while the BPO value is blank and visa-versa dependent upon asset.<br><br>The total UPB for the package is $29,653,001; the original mortgage amount is almost the same at $29,389,430.33; the total taxes owed (current and delinquent) is $792,289.49; the assessed value column totals to $11,079,847.79; the BPO value 30 days column totals to $11,183,589.79 and both of these columns are missing a lot of data, so the values will be higher once the missing values are added.<br><br>Even so, 20% of UPB = $5,930,600.22, which is 53% of BPO or Assessed Value even with missing data. <br><br>I am dealing with a seller&#39;s rep who claims to be seller direct.  I have tested her with Sal’s 6 key questions and she has responded promptly without needing to ask anyone else.  The excel spreadsheet has links to pdf files that appear to be appraisals as there are a number of comparative assets used to derive value.<br><br>Tim<br>        </p>

          Its actually 60 of BPO if you include the 1MM in taxes you are going to have to come up with when these properties foreclosure. Most sales when they happen are paid less taxes owed. I dont think that is a bad level depending on what this tape looks like and if values are real and they are not low balance or in crazy areas of the country. You have my heat map?  Second as Sal knows very well I dont work with a broker who has a relationship with someone else or a &quot;seller rep&quot; The only time I will do the work on my side is when a rep is representing me and has a direct relationship with a buyer&quot; I can go on linked in and find 1000 people who have a relationship through someone else. It doesnt work and it always winds up blowing up at the end of the day. Tell the rep your &quot;client&quot; will only let you deal direct with the seller and if you can have a conversation with the seller maybe it is worth looking at if the price makes sense. The number one things Sals steps say is direct on both sides. I am willing to do the work see if it is real if you are willing to truly vet it on your side. Right now you have a car sales man who knows a little bit about cars telling you everything you want to hear on the phone. Its shiny low miles cream puff of a car. But until you get on the lot you have zero idea whats under the hood. Stop talking to a saleguy and get to the car direct!! I think that is a great analogy ;)         </p>

          Dave,<br>Regarding the “Nationwide 403 NPN” pool, I have further information for you.  For my learning process, what don’t you like about this package?  I am a willing student so I highly value your feedback.<br><br>I have met with the pool owner, Jamie Johnson of 3 Star Properties LLC, his direct number is 828-595-5662.  Jamie would like to establish an on-going relationship with us as he will be taking down another 2000 assests in the next couple of weeks.  Most of his purchases come from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae.<br><br>He is willing to sell this pool but only as a complete package.  His company has made some progress with the mortgagees.  He stated that they have received over 120 positive responses to their “loan mod hello” letters with over 40 mortgagees making payments already.<br><br>Jamie believes that this pool is now more valuable with the higher percentage of performing notes included, thus he is asking a higher price now for the entire pool.  Jamie wants to sell this pool so he can be in better position to obtain new assets.<br><br>The pool does come with servicing.  This pool is from Freddie Mac.  We can access the collateral via dropbox as soon as they receive an LOI.<br><br>Jamie claimed that almost all of the BPO’s are in and according to their calculations the BPO value is $14 million.  They have had to do drive-by’s with the occupied homes and some of the boarded up homes but ones that could be accessed were walk through’s.<br><br>Therefore approximate breakdown is (obviously all can be verified once we access the collateral):<br>  UPB = $29,653,001.10 can be purchased for .25, which = $7,413,250.28<br>  BPO = $14,000,000<br>  Taxes Owed = $79,289.49<br>  Plus 1% sellers rep fee (Now that we are direct, further packages will not include a sellers rep fee.)<br>  <br>  Total Cost = Purchase price + Taxes Owed + 1% sellers rep fee = $8,279,672.27 which is 59.14% of BPO for a pool that is now an approximately 25% Performing Note package.<br><br>As a brief reminder, the state by state breakdown looks like this:<br><br>AL has 10 assets with an AVG UPB $76,223<br>FL has 24 at AVG UPB $84,706<br>GA – 44 – at $60,871<br>IL – 38 – at $117,595<br>IN – 40 – at $47,437 <br>KY – 12 – at $40,074 <br>MO – 28 – at $47,715<br>OH – 131 – at $51,201 <br>PA – 14 – at $42,918<br>TN – 20 – at $47,503<br>TX – 9 – at $60,359 <br>WI – 14 – at $52,228 <br>AZ – 7 – at $98,911 <br><br>Some interesting notes:<br>NY has 3 averaging $124,573 then another 9 averaging $37,849. <br>NJ has 2 averaging $234,250 then another 2 averaging $50,272. <br>MS has 1 averaging $257,449 then another 6 averaging $54,436.<br><br>The remaining pool assets are one or two per state with some fairly high values.<br><br>Thank you and have a great day.<br><br>Tim McIntyre<br>Mobile = 360-202-1728<br>Email = tim@mcinvestment-properties.com<br>        </p>

          Dave,<br>I have a list of NPN&#39;s from all over the country.  I have compiled the responses from the sellers rep:<br><br>&quot;Attached is the list of NPN’s, this list contains the 472 total of which 403 are still available.  This list is from Freddie Mac, I am told that approximately 40% of them are occupied and about half of the 40% are still paying.<br><br>These ones are .20 cents on the UPB balance. If you take the whole list. They will consider 100 minimum, preferably not breaking up the states.  Sold with servicing released.<br><br>In order to purchase send an LOI, if you are taking part them show the specific ones interested, If you are wanting the whole list, the just have to put “Nationwide 403 NPN”.  They would require an LOI and the contract will be prepared according to that.&quot;<br><br>I just received a second list from the sellers rep that has 736 assets listed from all over the US as well.  Would you be interested in seeing the list?<br><br>Thanks,  Tim McIntyre<br>mobile = 360-202-1728<br>office = 360-299-2964<br>tim@mcinvestment-properties.com<br>        </p>

          Tim,<br>If you remember I will not deal with any sellers reps/ buyers reps at all. This becomes a complete waste of your time and mine. I want to only see tapes that are direct to you from seller or your buyers you are direct with. I cant telll you how many times you see tapes like this and they are a waste of time. This is what is known as a daisy chain and a complete complete waste of your time and mine. Reputation is everything in this business and so is time. YOu will see that 95% of these reps have zero relationships and nothing gets done. To your success!!<br>        </p>

          Dave,<br>I am attempting to interpret the heat map against the following asset porfolio.  There is a 1st mortgage NPN portfolio in NY/NJ with a UPB of $31,867,259.66, with an average $230,000 BPO.  All foreclosure proceedings on the notes are more than 50% completed.  The pricing expectation is 72% of BPO.  According to the heat map, NY is 57% and NJ is 61%, thus making this porfolio priced high?  Is that the correct interpretation?         </p>

          That pricing is outright crazy!!!! 72 of BPO for assets in NY and NJ. Number one the foreclosure timelines in those states are some of the longest in the country and legal is also some of the highest in the country. 57% of BPO I am starting to feel is a bit aggressive. I just bought assets in NY and NJ outside of inner city and NYC(Manhattan) I paid 53% of value (closing next week), with a average balance of 300k. You should give your client that information see what they say. Dont get me wrong there is a sucker born every minute but who ever buys that is not making a dime. I hope this helps,         </p>
